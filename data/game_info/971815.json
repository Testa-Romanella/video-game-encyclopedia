You see, the wizard only wanted one thing.<br/>A place that all wizards seek, a tower. <br/>In the wizards tower, he could experiment with long forgotten magics and find those yet to be revealed.<br/>The king was all too eager to let the wizard have his tower if it meant he could live forever.<br/>And so the wizard built his tower, but not in months, years, or decades. No, the wizard made his tower in one night and it dwarfed the king's meger castle.<br/>This, of course, infuriated the king and he ordered his royal guard to go into the tower and bring that wizard to his heel.<br/>But after the guards entered, they never returned. Royal advisors, clerics, rangers, and all manner of hero were sent in; all to never return.<br/>Finally, after much time, the ever more aged king finally decided he must speak to this mad wizard himself. <br/>And that, my intrepid adventure, is where you come in. <br/>Many kings have come and went; nations have risen and fallen, and yet the tower remains.<br/>Adventures come from far and wide to enter, their heads filled with dreams of treasures, glory, and of course, immortality.<br/>Now it is your turn to see what lies in the 'Tower of the Mad Wizard'!<br/><br/><br/>'Tower of the Mad Wizard' is an action-RPG rogue-lite featuring multiple heroes that can be unlocked and leveled up throughout the game.<br/>Players who dare to enter the tower will find themselves surrounded by hordes of monsters and come face to face with different bosses as they struggle through this challenging game.<br/>But don't worry, some monsters drop treasure that you can use to permanently enhance your heroes and even unlock more to bring to the fight!<br/>Multiple game modes will be available to unlock as development continues during the Early Access process, eventually leading to 4 separate modes, including the main wave based arena, a trap filled labyrinth, a room based tower climb, and boss rush!<br/>Pick from an initial class of 4 playable characters with unique weapons and try to conquer the Tower of the Mad Wizard.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T09:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f843cc2e67a97180276eb98fc3265a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Talos Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Talos Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
