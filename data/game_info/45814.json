There are lots of different shapes that make levels in this game, some of them are easier to draw, and some of them not so much easy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are also allowed to use some hints on each level - but where's the fun in that?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCalculate your moves, watch where you put your lines and beat this game like a draw pro!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d43128c199ad3f1673ee816bbed87ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zonitron Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zonitron Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
