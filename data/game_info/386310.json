The project has evolved throughout a half a year of brainstorming, planning and implementing, a process which has resulted in this final product that is now publicly available for download. <br/><br/>The work is an interactive piece of media which aims to play with and deconstruct the concept of a \"video game\" as well as the very nature of choices and interactive media in general. The project was developed primarily in Game Maker Studio.<br/><br/>The title of this project refers to the implicit idea of you, the player, exploring a sprawling set of \"rooms\" that are all inter-connected and distinctivly grouped into various emotional \"regions\" of the dungeon. That said, the narrative is somewhat cyclical in its nature.<br/><br/>The work intentionally provides little context as for a correct way to interact with it. You are encouraged to feel and emotionally evaluate the input that you are given, and thusly reflect on the paths in which you are taken. Even if you might end up somewhere uncomfortable.<br/><br/><strong>Controls: </strong><br/>Controlled with a mouse or trackpad<br/>\"Esc\" to quit the program<br/>\"R\" to restart<br/><br/>If you would like to support me, a struggling aspiring artist, feel free to throw in a few coins with the download or write a comment on this page expressing your thoughts. <br/><br/><strong>Instagram: </strong><strong>mathias_of_westbrook</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f4defd5a77f3b359450f8bb90fccc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mathiaswestbrook"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
