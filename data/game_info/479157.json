The player must descend into the neuroticism of another mind or stop playing. \"Genf\u00e6rd\" is a danish word that normally would be translated to ghost, however this translation is not satisfactory. Another more context unaware translation would be rejourney or even reprocess. A ghost in this sense is a soul revisiting life, failing to transcend into the next world. It is re-processing its lifepath in an obsessive and sisyphean way. As with any mythological creature, the ghost has something to say about us and our psychology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0fd41e535ef5ba4317e80a67920b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArtIsWhat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
