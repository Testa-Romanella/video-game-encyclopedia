I'm not quite sure why I made it, but I had fun doing so.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move around</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>F\u00a0to sit in a chair</li><li>Space to jump or get up from a chair</li></ul>\n<p>Mouse speed and text speed can be changed from the options menu.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE REGARDING CONTENT:</strong></p>\n<p>All poems in this work are in the public domain of the United States. This means that they're all from the early 1920s or earlier. As you might expect from works that are around 100 years old or older, some of them contain content that, if not controversial then, would certainly be controversial now.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have taken the liberty of removing the most questionable poems I\u00a0found, but I almost certainly did not find all of them (there are, after all, almost 7000 of them). If you find any you think should be removed, let me know and I'll remove them when I\u00a0get a chance.</p>\n<p>Some of the content uses that terms are dated now, but were widely used at the time. Those works I did not take out, in large part because of the context of the words at the time, but also because\u00a0it would remove a large source of the diversity of the poets if I\u00a0did so.</p>\n<p>That said, many of the poems in here are legitimately great, and I've found it to be a fun way to discover some interesting new poetry, inbetween all of Robert Herrick's work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acb5678d5f4a6f231b67044a4810e506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
