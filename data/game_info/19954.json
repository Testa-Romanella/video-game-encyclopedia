{"id": 19954, "slug": "soul-saga", "name": "Soul Saga", "name_original": "Soul Saga", "description": "<p>AboutSoul Saga is a love letter to JRPG classics, and the comfort food of JRPG fans.  Utilizing the classic JRPG formula as a base, Soul Saga is the culmination of 3 years of prototyping and testing of new elements by a single full-time developer and thousands of passionate fans.  In addition, many artists around the world have contributed to Soul Saga to help give it the well rounded and polished art such a game deserves.  With over an hour of original music tailored specifically for JRPG fans, Soul Saga is both a fun and artistic journey through a familiar, yet fresh, world.<br />\nStory<br />\nOterra was a once lush and vibrant world, but it\u2019s surface is now wasted after the events of an ancient cataclysm.  The planet is now split into 3 distinguishable layers: the Sky Islands of Medonia, the Tempest Reef, and the Surface World of Oterra.<br />\nThis cataclysm was caused by a mysterious corruption called Ink that mutated the world\u2019s creatures into monsters called Inkheart.  The Inkheart ravaged society and mercilessly destroyed civilizations as they spread across Oterra.  The last haven for humanity, Medonia, was saved by a mysterious man called the Philosopher.  The Philosopher introduced the science of Alchemy to Medonia\u2019s people and they took up arms using their new Alchemical powers, but it was too late.  The Dragons of Oterra had succumbed to the Ink corruption and joined the assault against Medonia.  As a last effort, the Philosopher used his powers to raise Medonia off of the planet and into the sky, setting it safely on the clouds above and out of the reach of the indomitable Inkheart.<br />\nAnd now... 300 years after it\u2019s conception, the Tempest Reef is weakening, the Islands of Medonia are dying and falling from the sky, and an omen of catastrophic proportions has appeared.  There are rumors of a passage called Cloud\u2019s End that will allow a ship passage through the Tempest Reef to the surface world below.  It&#39;s assumed that one man found this passage, but left no trace of its existence behind.  The Guilds of Medonia now search for Cloud\u2019s End in hope to find a cure for their dying islands somewhere on the surface of Oterra.<br />\nArmed with alchemy and a mysterious sword, an ambitious young Guild Master travels the sky islands of Medonia in his new airship to uncover a way to save his homeland, but is he ready for the truth?<br />\nHelp Mithos and Elise fight against the impending menace threatening the sky islands of Medonia with their guild of close friends and unlikely allies.

An epic story involving sky islands, airships, Guilds, alchemical magics, interesting NPCs, deep lore, and heart-moving character developments.Development HistorySoul Saga was the first 3D JRPG launched on Kickstarter and gained immediate praise from new fans reaching over 300% of the original funding goal!  The new budget allowed Soul Saga to enhance its art style and gameplay based on fan feedback, but was still too small to finance a large dev team.  I then dedicated the next 3 years of my life working on Soul Saga as the only full time developer to bring you the best game I could.  I sincerely hope that you enjoy my humble love letter to JRPG classics and that it can bring just a fraction of the irreplaceable joy we all experienced from the great games that inspired it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-01T21:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/180097c1c37c78728d73eb383a5bd197.jpg", "website": "http://www.soulsaga.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Disastercake"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Disastercake"], "esrb_rating": null}
