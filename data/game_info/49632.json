Your task is to avoid letting the stacked blocks reach the top by arranging them in complete rows across the bottom. A completely filled row vanishes, giving you more opportunities to score. This game requires superior finger-eye coordination to arrange the shapes quickly, and it gets faster with time. Enjoy!
