Sadly our\u00a0 Programmers PC broke on the 2nd GGJ day and we had a long break. We decided to swap the models out and make a Werewolf vs Jogger game. It can only be played with controllers and only on splitscreen. We don`t plan to develop it further, because we`re working on our real game.\u00a0The game itself was completely created within three days. Afterwards only\u00a0the UI was reworked.</p>\n\n<p>I`ve added the current characters, which are in development and will replace the \"wierd\" ones =)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS</strong><br/>Dominique Mowius (Traumwolf) - Character Artist / Programming<br/>Dominik Geuer (Piontek) - Tech Art / Programming<br/>Michael Kaiser (Betonmischa) - Environment Artist<br/><br/><br/>PDF Presentation:<br/>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ap12vMmCVXPSx8FXfjdGue2h6UVnvwht/view<br/><br/>Global Game Jam Link:<br/>https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/blond-escape<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a1e9231d683ce3c923d968214191adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SacrificeStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
