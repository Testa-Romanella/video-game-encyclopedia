You will be playing as two characters: Bloopy &amp; Droopy. When it comes to platforming, Bloopy does that very well! But when you'll need to drill, Droopy comes in and he'll help you a lot in your adventure!</p>\n<p>By the way, you can <strong>right now</strong>\u00a0play a <strong>FREE DEMO</strong> of the game down below! </p>\n<strong>What about the story?</strong>\n<p>Bloopy &amp; Droopy are two best friends that love to explore space. But one day, when they discovered the planet they were heading for (The planet X-42), a terrible pirate known as Kurgos hit their spaceship! They then crashed on the planet on an unknown island where they'll need to get gather pieces of their ship and go back to their home.\r\n</p>\n<strong>How does it play?</strong>\n<p>In this platformer, you will be able not only to jump, double jump, or run, but also to drill and destruct big chunks of the levels! But be aware, you should be drilling in a smart way to get all the bonuses (like the gems or perhaps the hearts!) As Bloopy or Droopy, you must lead them to help each other and progress through the levels.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>It will work on both keyboard and any controllers (we highly recommend using an Xbox\u00a0controller, however).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>If you use a controller, please connect it to your computer before starting the game, else it will not work at all.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>- <strong>Keyboard </strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>X</strong>\u00a0to attack or validate</li><li><strong>Space </strong>or <strong>Up </strong>to jump / double-jump</li><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> to move</li><li><strong>Enter</strong> for validating or pause the game</li><li><strong>C</strong> to go back or going in drilling mode</li><li><strong>Backspace</strong> to go back</li></ul>\n<p><strong>- </strong><strong>Controller </strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>X</strong>\u00a0to attack or validate</li><li><strong>A</strong> to jump </li><li><strong>Thumbstick or DPAD</strong> to move</li><li><strong>Start</strong> to validate or pause the game</li><li><strong>B</strong> to go back or going in drilling mode</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd01aa9162491e63983125328c8f86fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamVeloper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
