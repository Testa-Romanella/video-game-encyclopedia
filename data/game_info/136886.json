The players then navigate through and consume a steady stream of smaller fish, each with their own effects. Discretion and group-decision making are at the heart of this game, with the two players\u2019 communication being their key to survival. Cooperation is rewarded though, as players who work together can chomp down on fish for a bonus effect!<br/><br/>Music by: DST</p><p>http://www.nosoapradio.us</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfcc11121fd15f839a2ff062566e5b40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["zlatabee"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
