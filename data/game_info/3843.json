Aside from the tutorial level and matches against bots with human teammates, there is no single player content. Current game modes include not only staples of the genre like Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill, but there is also a twist on the formula in case of Kill Confirmed mode. Players will have to kill enemies, but in order for the kill to count, it\u2019s necessary to collect tokens from them. Teammates can pick up tokens from their friends in order to deny the kill points for the enemy team.<br />\nLater added Onslaught and Siege modes brought more gimmick objective-based gameplay to the game. Total of sixteen maps of different sizes, complexity, and styles, which on top of the fully customizable equipment and appearances allows players to find unique look and playstyle, fitting for them.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2012-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b44e00fd4718f0a22981c370d7855b35.jpg", "website": "http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/blacklight-retribution", "rating": 2.53, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 60, "owned": 2104, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 152, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 94, "ratings_count": 235, "suggestions_count": 654, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 235, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Hardsuit Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Perfect World Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
