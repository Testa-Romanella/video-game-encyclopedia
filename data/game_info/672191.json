Every single asset and script was made within the allotted time of the game jam. No pre-made assets whatsoever (except for Suzanne of course).</em></p><br/>Gameplay:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - move\r\n    </li><li>Space - Jump/jetpack\r\n    </li><li>left click - call villagers to follow you </li><li>right click + left click - aim and shoot</li></ul>\r\nObjective:\r\n<p>Try to save the villagers by shooting your projectiles into the  meteor AOE indicators. This lets the villagers know to avoid the area.\r\n      When the meteor shower ends, rally all the survivors and jump into  the ocean to go back in time. Followers that go back with you learn to  avoid the meteors on their own.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING: don't hold down Left CTRL, there was supposed to be a mechanic where spider mobs shoot out of the monkey's mouth, but I forgot to move the monkey into position for the final build, and holding control keeps spawning spiders even if you cant see them</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>The UI is massive and there's a bit of mountain that snuck it's way onto the UI camera</li><li>Calling villagers simultaneously dismisses your followers, and brings new ones to your side. As a result, you cant stack villagers by spamming the call. So try to use it when you're surrounded by a lot of them</li><li>spider mobs were modeled, animated, programmed and ready to kill BUT I FORGOT TO SPAWN THEM SO THERE'S ONLY ONE CHILLING IN THE WATER. There's a cannon in Suzanne's mouth ready to spit out a swarm of spiders :(</li></ul>\r\nDescription:\r\n<p>To fit the \"share knowledge\" theme, we came up with a pretty complex  idea that we couldn't fully implement. The game was going to take place  on an island during an apocalyptic event separated by stages. Each stage  would be a different challenge such as meteor shower, flooding,  radiation.\r\n    </p>\n<p>As the player, your first time through would be difficult since you  don't know what to expect. If you manage to survive you are met with an  unstoppable boss. You can then jump into a time portal and restart the  apocalypse with everything you know.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Your goal is then to try and teach the villagers how to survive by  leading them away from threats. If the villagers get to the end with  you, they go back in time, are now smarter, and can fend for themselves  and help others.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Eventually, you amass an army of villagers that can kill the final boss.\r\n    </p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Skleembof - All 3D assets + some programming (skleembof@pm.me)</li><li>Alex Ramallo - Most of the programming (alejandro@ramallo.me)</li></ul>\n<p>Backtrace link: https://share.backtrace.io/api/share/QcDG6u51f7YTkvo4muja82</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04fe23166e835891e3358fbfa5fd0dc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skleembof"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
