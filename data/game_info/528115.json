It's a bit like ravenfield at the moment, but I will add more features in later updates... SandBox mode\u00a0will be a bit more like ancient warfare 3. Currently, the game is pretty blank. The only mode that I\u00a0can say\u00a0for sure\u00a0works is Single Player Bot Battle, the other modes\u00a0are either empty or extremely under polished. Despite all that though, I have learned a lot, and will hopefully continue developing. Any donations or suggestions are greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:33:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/823b7895a9da81764d09f6f0960f3bed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["relog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
