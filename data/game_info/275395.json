I love it. <br/></p>\n<p>The game had a secret ending if you finished it without absorbing enemy cells. The main character would chop his arm off to end the infection. <br/></p>\n<p>Developed for the Global Game Jam 2015 (https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/azim-sentinel-corduba), in 48h. The jam site location was C\u00f3rdoba (Andaluc\u00eda, Spain), and we wanted to feature some part of the city in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Props to Raul, for making all those amazing sprites in just a few hours.<br/></p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<ul><li>        Fernando Hidalgo  \r\n  \r\n</li><li>\n<em>\n</em><em>              Maikel_Ortega  \r\n  \r\n</em></li><li><em>\n<em>\n</em><em>              megabyte101  \r\n  \r\n</em></em></li><li><em><em>\n<em>\n</em><em>              pronick  \r\n  \r\n</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>\n<em>\n</em><em>              raulbayushi  </em></em></em></em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16bfa1338b6d230f8a6c13e41a02b9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maikel Ortega"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
