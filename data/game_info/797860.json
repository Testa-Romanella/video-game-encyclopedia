There should be multiple ways to do this (though I didn't have time to implement properly).</p>\n<p>I didn't get as much finished as I would have liked, but I only started with Unity 3 months ago and this is my first 2d game in unity. Haven't made games before that since when I was a teenager making games in C++ in DOS using the Allegro engine. Also I went camping for the first three days of the jam and worked full time during the week, so you get what you get.</p>\n<p>All artwork and code my own.</p>\n<p>Other Assets:</p>\n<p>The opening title music:</p>\n<p>Piano Logo by LiteSaturation</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/piano-logo-108963/<br/></p>\n<p>http://pixabay.com/users/litesaturation-17654080/</p>\n<p>Prologue music:</p>\n<p>Spirit Blossom by Roman Belov</p>\n<p><strong>https://pixabay.com/music/beats-spirit-blossom-15285/</strong></p>\n<p>http://pixabay.com/users/romanbelov-25347333/</p>\n<p>Chapter 1 music:</p>\n<p>In the Forest - Ambient Acoustic Guitar Instrumental Background Music For Videos by Lesfm</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/solo-guitar-in-the-forest-ambient-acoustic-guitar-inst...<br/></p>\n<p>http://pixabay.com/users/lesfm-22579021/</p>\n\n<p>Font:</p>\n<p>ReenieBeanie-Regular by\u00a0James Grieshaber</p>\n<p>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Reenie+Beanie#standard-styles</p>\n<p>Open Font License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a19418df67a407c2a73b445294d049a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sandinshorts"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
