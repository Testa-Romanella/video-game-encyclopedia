All assets have been made by me. Just kidding, did you really think I would learn blender just for this stupid game? Anyways most assets have been downloaded from https://www.kenney.nl/assets. Ignore the cover image, I didn't have any idea for the cover image so I chose a random picture from my PC. If you actually gonna download this game then please give some feedback and ideas. Thanks for checking this game out. Also if you decide to donate it will for sure help me in development. 100% of the money will go into development and 0% to me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T19:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec9575ecff777a867ab9b8724c788fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["markoloko1223"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
