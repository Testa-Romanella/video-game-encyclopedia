Alone.. Wet.. Hungry.. A\u00a0tummy full of fish is the only way to keep going!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys on the keyboard for movement.\u00a0</li><li>You cannot move backwards, the tide will pull you backwards naturally.\u00a0</li><li>You can use the currents at the top and bottom to move faster</li><li>Catch fish to keep your hunger bar above 0</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made for the Whisker Jam 2022 with theme - NO WAY BACK. We incorporated the theme into the game in 2 ways. You are a cat stranded in the ocean, you are unable to make it back to the beach. You also cannot swim backwards!<br/><br/>The game was fun to make, we used it as an opportunity to try out the GODOT Game engine. Unfortunately we used GODOT 4 which is still in development which does not have a WEBGL renderer yet. As such the game has to be downloaded.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T12:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890d18854aab89c20a3ada7dab1a7908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sneaksy", "sepeth", "Emmasaurus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
