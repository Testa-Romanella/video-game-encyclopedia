Yet, not everything is as it seems.<br/>Also, there are multiple endings, in case you've got\u00a0confused why the game was so easy.<br/><br/>The jam's theme was to create a game in a certain genre, but missing a key feature. My game is a roguelike, which is a very restrictive genre, and throws most of the rules out of the window:<br/>-There's no permadeath, because you can't even die<br/>-The game isn't turn based, it's full real time<br/>-It doesn't have ASCII graphics<br/>-Instead of complex cotrols, all the letter keys do the same<br/>-There are no RPG elements outside of a one hidden gameplay decission<br/>-There's no need for combat, enemies die by touching the character<br/><br/>The Wizard is armed with powerful spells:<br/>-a fire spell destroys everything it touches<br/>-a light spell freezes things in time<br/>-a nature spell grows thick vegetation, giving cover from enemies<br/><br/>Sound effects were created with Bfxr.<br/>The song used \"La Cala Horra\" by rolemu.<br/><br/>Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/9882176cb3289b47d41d9ee822aded0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunatic Dancer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
