Their ships and armies are \n      more powerful than before, and Earth will surely be conquered unless the \n      new R-90 ship can destroy them. Powered with engines that launch it into \n      different dimensions, and armed with the Round, Shadow and Cyclone \n      Forces, the R-90 has what it takes to wipe out the BYDO threat. The BYDO \n      mother ship must be found and destroyed to entirely erase the species \n      from our galaxy.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
