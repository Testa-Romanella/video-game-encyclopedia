{"id": 465785, "slug": "else-explode", "name": "else: explode", "name_original": "else: explode", "description": "<p>\"else: explode\" is a puzzle game about navigating explosive robots through simple mazes. Sounds simple enough, but the only control you have over the robots is changing the simple rules they follow; and once they've set off, they're completely out of your control.</p>\n<p>This is simple at first, but the difficulty quickly scales as the robots aren't the only thing moving around the mazes...</p>\r\nHow do I get it?\r\n<p>The game is available for Windows via the download at the bottom of the page. It's written in java so will require a java installation to run. (Theoretically everything involved is cross platform, so give it a go on different operating systems, but this game was made solo in a game jam, so hasn't been tested on anything other than Windows)</p>\r\nHow do I play it?\r\n<p>All you need to play this game is a mouse. You give the robots instructions by clicking on the icons in their code, and then click a button to send them off into the world. That's all there is to it! There are 15 levels which unlock as you complete them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f043bcbc8c7823f61a8a9fada0aa008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheJackOfClubs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
