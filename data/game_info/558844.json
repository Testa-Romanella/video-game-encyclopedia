The core of the game is a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>THE MECHANICS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The main core of the game is based on the John Conway model, but there are some differences in the initial state of the game. The player is able to define the initial rules for the cells as well as their appearance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9faae4543a182b894f30587de49ffbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Generalis"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
