When the player collects all of the pellets on the level they can then move to the next by hitting the goal button, but you will have to get to it first.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe player doesn't move the ball directly, instead the player controls the game by rotating the level to the left or right, whilst relying on the always downward force of gravity to move about,\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was originally made over 3 days with 20 levels for the Ludum Dare 34 game jam, with the theme of growing and two button controls.</p><p>You can check out my Ludum Dare submission page here.<br/></p><p>Best played full screen.</p>\r\n\tControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Rotate left</strong><strong>:</strong> a, Left arrow key, left mouse button, left on joystick or touch left side of screen.</li><li><strong>Rotate right:</strong> d, right arrow Key, right mouse button, right on joystick or touch right side of screen.</li><li><strong>Select:</strong> Enter, A button on gamepad.</li><li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Escape or B button on gamepad.</li><li><strong>Pause game:</strong> Pause|Break or Start button on gamepad.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb91b058552bd37a1a3f5a48ede7fbeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["NoddingTortoise"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
