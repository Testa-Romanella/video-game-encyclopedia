Five years ago, there was a terrible accident. It still haunts you today, but with the help of your friends Nasrin, Jessamine, Azzy, Dwija, Kamlai and Rukhsar, you have been able to recover. Now there's even a chance that some romance is blossoming between you and one of your adventuring friends...</p><p>However, there's one person who you're worried about that still dwells on that fateful day. Can you save Terezinha from her grief?</p><p><strong>V 1.0: </strong></p><p>In progress / making sure I submit before the end of the game jam. Currently, you can only see the intro of the game. There is a persistent bug that doesn't allow you to choose any name but 'Kiran' at start (sorry! ;o; I'm not sure why). Everything else in the customization window works. Currently very low-graphics. I will be adding to this after the Jam and updating until the full script is implemented. Thanks for playing. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f8239d55d4b6fab7d765dea146a2168a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LydiaE"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
