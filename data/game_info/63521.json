The former owner was mysteriously murdered inside the house 5 years ago by an unknown dark entity. Since then, the new owner of the Haunted house is pretty scared to even set foot in the house because of the dark history associated with it. The owner believes that there is a portal which leads to the Devil's world inside the house which is yet to be proved. It is also believed that various rituals have been performed during the 1980s in the house which is the primary reason behind the increased poltergeist activities.<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters Crew: International, which consists of four members, has been hired by the owner of the house to investigate and eliminate evil spirits by performing exorcisms and by various other means.
