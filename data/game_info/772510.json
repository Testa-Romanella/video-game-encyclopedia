The demo is just very much focused on the level editor and level design!</em></strong></p>\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n<p>You are a sentient fruit, amongst a tribe of fruits who are all very conscience.\u00a0 However, the Garden in which you live starts to be infiltrated by a corrupt plant, that has time and dimension warping abilities. You discover that you have a strange ability to move and jump very quickly, and to reach places no other fruit can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crazy mad scientist of the tribe recruits you to be the hero the tribe needs to fend off this corrupt plant. Little did they know that it would take a time travelling journey through dimensions to find the source of the corruption and to end it for good.<br/></p>\n<strong>Inspiration</strong>\n<p><em>Garden's Bane is a precision platformer, inspired by games such as Kirby Superstar, Donkey Kong Country, and Warioland, and even more modern indie titles such as Celeste and\u00a0Super Meatboy.</em></p>\n<p>The full version of this game is based off an original jam game project!
