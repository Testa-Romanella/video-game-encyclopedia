Overcome the many hazards that the labs present and find yourself an exit before you dissolve away.</p>\n<p>Project Goo is an in-development student project. The reason we're publishing here right now, at this stage, is to get some playtesting data. The current Coronavirus situation has left us with few options for conducting our playtests. It would help us out greatly if you were to test the game out and fill in the following form:\u00a0https://forms.gle/DAdhJyjACGzwevrBA</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Simply download the ZIP folder and extract it. The extracted folder should have a Project Goo v.0.1.9.exe file in it. Run it to play the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Movement<ul><li>\u00a0WASD</li><li>Arrow Keys</li></ul></li><li>Jump<ul><li>\u00a0Space</li><li>K</li><li>Z</li></ul></li><li>Bash<ul><li>Left Mouse Click</li><li>J</li><li>C</li></ul></li><li>Dash<ul><li>Left Shift</li><li>L</li><li>X</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Wall Hold (to be removed from game)<ul><li>Right Mouse Click</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417980c2ad4ab03741cf6addecbb0011.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xanhisam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
