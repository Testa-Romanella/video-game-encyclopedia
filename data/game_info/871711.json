I hope the oddness helps you to retain some of this information.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I am Tyson Savoretti, and as of writing this, I am a law student at Stetson University College of Law in the year 2022.\u00a0 My professor is Marco Jimenez, and he is the one who introduced my part-time Contracts class to Hohfeld and this idea of defining rights in a more precise manner.\u00a0\u00a0 I created this game as a project and was inspired by the phrase \"...delve into contract law...\" from our syllabus.\u00a0 It is a funny thing, to have someone pick apart the idea of \"rights.\" Don't we already know what rights are?\u00a0 Haven't they been enumerated in our country's founding documents?\u00a0 Do we not strive to \"fight for\" and \"stand up\" for our rights on a daily basis?\u00a0 I write this preamble in the year 2022, where the cause du jour is that of a variety of civil rights; including transsexual, racial rights, and the idea of equality vs. equity. If you read this in the year 2072, perhaps the Western world has settled these matters (though I doubt this).</p>\n<p>Since I created this game as a fun way of exploring what Hohfeld was talking about, I want to keep this post-script conversational, as if you were sitting next to me, sipping a whiskey, and pontificating like those Western men whose debate built the foundations of the legal systems which we all enjoy (and suffer).<br/></p>\n<p>This post-script text here shall serve as a study guide to give a bit more clarity, and to point you toward other resources.</p>\n<p>What are rights? If you were to have this debate with friends, political adversaries, family, etc., you may imagine yourself having a challenging time even finding common footing on which to begin a conversation, let alone find the ground common enough to come to conclusion.</p>\n<p>What are human rights? What are gay rights? Do animals other than humans have rights? How do we know? Where do we \"get\" our rights? Is it from a old piece of parchment? Do we get them from stone tablets, golden plates, read off a laminated card prior to our arrest?\u00a0 Are they enumerated because men decide on them? Do we \"derive them\" from our peers and decide democratically? Do they come from God?\u00a0 If they do come from God, why all the confusion? If they come from men, which men are \"right\" about them?</p>\n<p>Now, hopefully, you see how much more enjoyable a conversation this could have been had we really been sitting on a porch with whiskey...but for Hohfeld...</p>\n<p>Hohfeld, I imagine, shone through the clouds and attempted to topple the tower of confusion when he laid out his ideas about the precise nature of talking about rights. He figured, that if we could be more exact about how we speak about rights, we would have better results discussing them.\u00a0 He was especially interested in the interplay between individuals which corresponding, correlative\u00a0rights, and those rights that were in opposition to one another.</p>\n<p>I have included some additional reading on the topic below, but allow me to give you a bit of an overview.</p>\n<p>Let us talk about the first set of correlative\u00a0rights, the Right/Duty relationship. It is a bit reflexive to say it this way, so I attempt to clarify by saying Claim/Duty to lessen the potential confusion for anyone not suffering law school while reading this.\u00a0 A claim/duty relationship is one in which there is an existing legal relationship. One party has a claim, the other a duty (all the Hohfeldian pairs are like this).\u00a0 If I have a claim to a parcel of land, you have a duty.\u00a0 You are bound (legally) to respect my claim and you cannot , without another Hohfeldian correlative, change this relationship.</p>\n<p>So if you have a duty, the opposite of your duty is a privilege. A privilege is one where you have a choice about how you act in respect to something.\u00a0 If I have the privilege of walking on a public street, you have \"no-right\" to my privilege. The term \"no-right\" is imperfect, in my opinion, but no one yet knows my last name as well as Hohfeld so I consider myself to have \"no-right\" to complain about it. If you caught what just happened, you are either a genius or you to have taken a Contracts class from Professor Jimenez. You see, the no-right position is correlative to the privilege position.\u00a0 If someone has a privilege, that must mean that someone else has a \"no-right\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0Confused yet? Have a little more whiskey.</p>\n<p>The claim/duty and privilege/no-right relationships represent relationships that currently exist. What about when it comes to changing legal relationships?</p>\n<p>\u00a0On the \"right\" side of the diagram, there exists another set of relationships.\u00a0 They exist to describe the rights associated with the ability to change a legal relationship.</p>\n<p>The first is the Power/Liability relationship. In this relationship, the party with the power, exerts it over another, who has a liability with respect to that power. In other words, if I have the power to convert our relationship, you are liable to have that conversion take place.\u00a0 If I make you an offer to sell you my car, you now have the power to accept, and change the relationship of my car as it pertains to me. If you accept my offer, your power converts my car to you (assuming you don't breach, etc.)\u00a0 You now have a claim to that car, and I, have a duty to your claim.</p>\n<p>Like in our first set of examples, the liability right also has an opposite. The opposite of a liability is an immunity. An immunity simply means that you cannot have your legal relationship changed by another. If you are immune to prosecution due to your status, it simply cannot be changed by these same rules.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Finally, when one has an immunity, another must have \"disability.\" This makes sense! If an immunity means that another cannot change your legal relationship, that other person holds a disability.\u00a0 In other words, a disability, opposite to power, means you have no power to change a legal relationship.</p>\n<p>These rights may be best viewed as a set of two grids. The trick with understanding these relationships is to viewing these rights and the interplay between them.\u00a0 If you notice the Right/Duty column, for instance, you can see that diagonal from each Right/Duty, are the \"jural opposites.\" Right is opposite from No-Right, and Privilege is opposite from Duty.</p>\n\n\r\n These tables are taken from class discussion and PowerPoint (Professor Marco Jimenez\r\n\n<p>Please feel free to explore the game some more, as well as a few of the articles that I've included at the bottom.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you, again, for enjoying the game.\u00a0 I had a fun time learning about the Bitsy game development engine, and hope to incorporate more legal ideas in the future using novel approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jimenez, Marco, Contract Law: A Case and Problem Based Approach (Aspen Casebook)\r\n  <ul><li>https://www.amazon.com/Contract-Law-Problem-Approach-Casebook/dp/1454863307\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Jimenez, Marco, Distributive Justice and Contract Law: A Hohfeldian Analysis (September 7, 2017).
