The Treasure Island card generates 1 Gold and 1 Iron, and the Coastal VIllage card generates 1 Wood and 1 Food.</p>\n<p>These supplies that are generated can be used to upgrade your cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting</strong></p>\n<p>During the game, you can use supplies gained from the island cards to upgrade the cards in your hand and make them more powerful.</p>\n<p>At the start of every turn, before you place a card on the grid, you have the opportunity to craft in the crafting area. The crafting area is the square away from the grid that has the hammer emblem displayed on it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To craft, place a card from your hand onto the crafting area, then the upgrade options available for that card will be displayed nearby. The cost to upgrade to that card will be displayed next to it and, if you have sufficient materials, you will be able to purchase the card. Any cards you can\u2019t afford when looking to buy will have their costs\u00a0be displayed in red.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Notes<br/></strong>This game is based off of the triple triad card game in the final fantasy series and fused with new and interesting elements to make the game play more strategic.</p>\r\nDevelopers\r\n<p><strong>Music, SFX and Game Design</strong><br/>Jason Peers<br/>https://www.magmaconproductions.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Art &amp; Programming<br/></strong>hquil<br/>https://hquil.itch.io/</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/>Daniel32010 for contributing the card mesh and\u00a0texture<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T06:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/4772b695f689caf2a009676a3c6cb511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HQUIL", "Magma Con Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
