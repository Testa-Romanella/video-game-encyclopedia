You are constantly holding a large kitchen knife in one claw, and the other can be used to collect and throw small items. Making your way around the world, you solve simple physical puzzles and break objects, getting bonus points. You are not the most graceful of crustaceans, you have shaky walking and inept jumps which often just turns you upside down and force to flounder on a back, but with a little patience and determination you will show these annoying people who is the owner here!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another feature of this game is the interaction with the world and objects. For example, you can find dynamite in people's closets, put it in the oven and wait for people to turn it on and it will explode, or you can just start to cause chaos in the kitchen and watch people panic and run from side to side. It would seem that nothing, but in fact it is very fun.<br/> <br/>Run on a huge open world, climb on different surfaces, destroy everything around, swing a huge table knife and just have fun, bringing terror to people.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81e3a90576e87ef92c1bf70e7beb3e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ANDREY MUSTAEV"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["ANDREY MUSTAEV"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
