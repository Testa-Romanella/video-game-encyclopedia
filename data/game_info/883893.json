I recommend you start in park creator with an empty park and get used to the controls (shown in the lower left of the UI) and the placement of built-in obstacles (left side in editor view) and puzzlepieces (left side in editor view). <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Play-Mode:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Solve puzzles by navigating your skater through the park and hit crazy tricks on the way! Place curves and small obstacles to reach the finish line, while hitting all the tricks required of you. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Editor-Mode:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Build Puzzle-Skateparks, solve them - and upload then upload them for everyone to solve! Set the required tricks, the amount of pushes and place obstacles wherever you want. You need to finish a park with the required tricks in order to upload it. When other people play your park, built-in obstacles (left side in editor view) will stay where they are, while smaller Obstacles (right side in editor view) still have to be placed in a fitting way to finish the park.</p>\n<p><strong>Ride-Only-Parks:</strong></p>\n<p>In Ride-Only-Parks, you can't place any obstacle. It's just for riding and getting a good time / score. Creating Ride-Only-Parks takes up a lot of space, due to memory storage, so it's a bit limited.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T11:58:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/174829a2c379c30a7c28704073423153.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mhenry"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
