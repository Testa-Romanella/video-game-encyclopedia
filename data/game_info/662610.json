Try to find them all!</p>\n<p><strong>Puzzle<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Solve the riddle at the end of each level to unlock the next, move bricks onto buttons to find the way out, and break your brain with complex systems!</p>\n<p><strong>DIE.</strong></p>\n<p>Die repeatedly. Over and over again. Sometimes for stupid reasons, sometimes for complex ones. Losing is fun, as Urist McProgrammer always says!</p>\n\n<p>After completing what's there of the game so far, you can challenge yourself by trying to complete the levels as fast as possible, or with as few hits as possible. Post your best times for each level here, and see how you fared against others!<br/></p>\n<p>We plan to expand this game over time, adding more levels and areas as time goes on.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: The sound effects during the boss level are not ours, and instead are from here:)</p>\n<p>(We will get our own sound effects later. For now, credit is given.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/317b0592c6d7c5b0749e9b4e4582c861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["twoGuysStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
