LD page: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&amp;uid=20884<br/></p><p>Your goal is to brew a magic potion which will make you happy, but for it you need three types of ingredients. <br/> <br/>&lt;--- GOAL ---&gt; <br/> <br/>Collect 30 of each ingredient to complete your potion. <br/> <br/>&lt;--- QUICK GUIDE ---&gt; <br/> <br/>If you don't know what to do: <br/>First day: just press the button. <br/>First night: collect seeds by hovering your mouse over them. <br/>Second day: mutate a bush with DNA, plant some seeds. <br/>Go on, find a snowman. <br/> <br/>&lt;--- INSTRUCTIONS ---&gt; <br/> <br/>Collect 30 ingredients of each type to win. <br/> <br/>You can plant seeds only on days, click ground to plant. <br/> <br/>You can gather resources and seeds only at night, move your mouse over something to pick it up. GREEN CUBES ARE SEEDS, blue cubes, red spheres and yellow cylinders are ingredients. <br/> <br/>Enemies drop DNA when killed - use those to create protector-plants. <br/> <br/>Mutated plants do not give seeds or resources. Don't forget to keep few of each kind for reproductive purposes. <br/> <br/>&lt;--- CHANGES ---&gt; <br/> <br/>Fixed typo that made the game too dark. <br/>Fixed spontaneous day/night changes bug. <br/> <br/>Music by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) - \"Happy Bee\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a93/a9396efb568641515fdf06c28cfaf6a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["mortus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
