You differ in no respect from the others, and in fact start out weaker than them. Only by training and gaining experience and intellect will you learn to survive and become stronger. <br/><br/>You can become whoever you\u2019d like to be! Pirate, hero, or anything inbetween! In-game, your character can possess certain skills that are dependant on you. In Space Universe, you are limited only by time and your desire. Studying skills is necessary to understand what skills enemies have in dire situations.<br/>The economic and political model of the game depends on you--the player-- giving you new opportunities every day!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features of game:</strong><br/><ul><li>- Arrangement of the ship / station as it pleases you. <br/><br/></li><li>- Dynamic battles.<br/><br/></li><li>- Customization. You will be able to create the ship however you wish. Possibilities of your ship completely depend on the decisions chosen by you.
