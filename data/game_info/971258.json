Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.<h3>OTHER SPECIES</h3><br/>The ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you\u2019ll be forming an alliance with, and who you\u2019ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy...<br/>We\u2019ll have to fight and trade \u2013 and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story.<h3>SURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING</h3><br/><ul><li> You can try your hand at surviving.

Some events form a story, and some occur randomly.
