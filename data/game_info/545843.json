I don't want to go on and explain the game and everything about it here, so I recommend just downloading it and trying it, it is really small and is completely free.</p>\n\n<p>But since I am the way I am, I might as well write a bit about the game! It is a simple hitman and robbery bob inspired top down shooter (or something) where you throw things to try and catch the enemy inside the spacestation. It is a pretty interesting concept, don't think I did it too well though, as I was way too focused on trying to create my own pathfinding and doing things from scratch. There is no music or art, I just wanted to focus on the gameplay and programming.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I have been waaaay too inactive at about every social media I have. A while that was because of me being a slow arse and a bit for quite a bit of other reasons.</p>\n<p>The main reason is that I were trying to finish Hikari, but the scope was wayyy to big to finish within the one month that we (I made the game together with another developer that worked with me during the jam) so the projected ended up dragging on for about half a year until we finally killed it off. It was more or less a mercy kill at that point, because we were so damn unmotivated about it.</p>\n<p>The other reasons are a bit more personal. I have finally gotten old enough to go to the gymnasium, which is pretty funkin awesome, so I'm finally leaving the \"Swedish high school\" behind! That came with it's fair share of problems and complications and so on as well, but it is a lot of fun to be there, and it is wayyy better than high school (h\u00f6gstadiet). Anyways I think you get the point. We got a new girl in the class in the end of last semester, so now there are two, and the rest of the class is just fuckin boys. That's what you get for picking a technical line, or whatever it is supposed to be called in English. And yes, I'm so Swedish I don't bother google translate it.</p>\n<p>The cover image is a simple design that I made. If this would become a full game the main character would maybe look a bit like that.</p>\n<p>So a TLDR for you all, this is a game about throwing shit at a red big scary thing and then throwing it into a prison and win. I'll be messing around with some different stuff now for a while, but I'll probably be more active with some new different stuff coming soon!</p>\n\n<p>If you want more of me, or want to throw me a message about anything, then send an email (hizuvia@gmail.com) or go to my twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd3a2abd41af93c099cf89c5d5642cba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HIZUVI"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
