In it you play an alien who has come down to Earth to indulge his dream\u00a0of being a competitive skier at a range of misspelled\u00a0ski resorts.\u00a0It is an ode to one of the greatest skiing games of all-time Ingemar Ragnemalm's Skiing Game for Mac OS.</p>\n<p><strong>What worked...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ct.js\u00a0delivered - yet again!</li><li>Abandoning the Greed theme.\u00a0Although it saved oodles of time in The Fall - it just wasn't working for this project and abandoning it partially salvaged the graphics.\u00a0The skier himself was too difficult to replace and remains an alien.</li><li>Ketsa's peppy Bless-Ups really adds to the skiing and takes the pressure off. Netalloy's\u00a0Glacier sort of saves the graphics.
