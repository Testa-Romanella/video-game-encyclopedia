I\u00a0hope you can see the kind of game we were going for here - an erratic, random, stay-on-top-of-everything game. Two of the four rooms are empty (which is a real shame because Bella made some excellent art, though Ollie could not put it together in time!!), but at the very least, there is a nice title screen, tutorial, and SFX/art for you to enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This has not been submitted for rating, please refrain from doing so if the jam does not prevent this.</p>\n\n<p>--- ORIGINAL PLANNED INTRO ---</p>\n<p>Cat sit for your friend in a cozy cabin, just out of town. Put your feet up, relax... but there are a few small things you might need to get done for Marnie while you are there. Keep the plants watered, the cat fed, the fire blazing, and more.</p>\n\n<p>--- CREDITS ---</p>\n<p>Game concept, design and prop art assets - BellaOA</p>\n<p>Game programming, music, (some)\u00a0SFX, principle Twitch streamer\u00a0- OllieOA</p>\n<p>Other SFX from freesounds.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f878d23b692cb93f4c4932e5450c0c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OllieOA", "BellaOA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
