Here we are dedicated to the betterment of the lives of flightless and walkless birds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, we prepared and advanced computer simulation where you can help us test our newest invention: The Spring Bird! This little fella should provide new forms of locomotion to our feathered friends, and you can experience that first hand!

My name is Luiz, and this is my submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2018. This was my first Game Jam and this is my first game on Itch.Io. And I worked on it all by myself! It's been a blast, and i'm super tired.</p>\n<p>My idea was to do a infinite-runner style of game (like Bit.Trip Runner for example) where you couldn't run, only jump. Alternatively, you could say it is a platformer where you can't run. Either way, I think I managed to do something interesting with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I worked really hard, and it's far from perfect, but I'm super proud of what I accomplished here.\u00a0 Thank you for playing, and thank you to Mark Brown for the opportunity.\u00a0 So, yeah. Hope you all like it. And do tell me if there's any problem. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d17ecff4fc1edc81289a4f3ae2a8fe78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuizMagdanello"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
