Remember the controls is LMB to command your dog, and RMB or R to reset the game! Simply it's just destroying this room, I hope you have fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(If I wasn't as busy, I would have loved to add a shop feature in the game, where you can buy different dogs. But maybe I'll save that idea for the future)</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has given every game developer the assets they need, to make the best games they can on OpenGameArt.com.
