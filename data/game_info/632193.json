It's a <strong>roughly 3-4 minute long</strong> sort of visual novel thing that's basically one long meta ramble written more or less as a stream of consciousness in one evening with the telly on in the background.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, you can play it in your\u00a0browser above (Ren'Py's browser support is in beta and images sometimes look a little funky when they load in, but it's pretty solid) OR you can download it below if for some reason you want to keep this thing I\u00a0cobbled together safe for all of time (or until computers stop being a thing).</p><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Yes the characters' names are Carl and Not Carl, this is a thing you can find out if you play the demo for The Falcon Shuffle itself enough times...</p>\n<p>ENJOY?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T04:04:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f56cfc415c6c5843c15493e59c1136a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RobGamesThingy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
