You play as a hitwoman, who has to hunt down 4 targets, each amidst other people (and the police), using only hints related to their appearance and a gun loaded with a single bullet per mission. </p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><em>Mouse</em><strong> </strong>- Navigation in menu<br/></p>\n<p><em>Left and right arrow keys</em> -\u00a0 Movement</p>\n<p><em>Spacebar</em> - Execution</p>\n<p>Playtime ~5 minutes</p>\n\n<p>Music by Tapio Piuva<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>According to the original idea, there should have been loads of different information to gather by observing the possible suspects, allowing the hints to be more difficult. After finding the suspect, the player would then draw the gun, aim and shoot, and disappear to a panicking crowd. There should have been different guns and maps to choose from and lots of upgrades.  In the end, hints are related mainly to the colors of the clothes and the execution is reduced to a single action. I did not have time to invent any crowd dynamics, but luckily the ability to hide behind single characters did the trick.   Sadly not all of the ideas made it into the finished game, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c958e3868b20f5595cfdfc13c918fb64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zhedd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
