All 3d models and their respective materials were kit bashed, but all gameplay logic and systems were built specifically for the jam. Void took simple audio samples, along with his own created samples, and made some incredible audio and MetaSounds that really give this project life.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Game details:</strong><br/>You find yourself lost in a mysterious forest. There are some near by cabins, and other points of interest. Beware of what you collect and touch however, as there may be unforeseen consequences.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Known Issues:\u00a0<br/></strong>- Mushroom randomization was supposed to occur on every playthrough, but only happened during construction.\u00a0<br/>- Restart button in menu can be triggered multiple times.\u00a0<br/>- One missing audio variable (this has no impact on the game)<br/>*Once judging is complete, a build with these small fixes will be uploaded.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T17:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb73451e2d32f61eeada31d9ad0789c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mad Tea Party Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
