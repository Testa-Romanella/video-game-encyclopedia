You will receive three scores: one which is your speed, one which is the exploration score (how may buildings youve found and painted and which naturally rewards your exploration of the world), and finally a technical score which is a mathematic calculation based upon those scores where you could get a high technical score even if you didnt paint as many building as you wanted to. \u00a0<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use a gamepad or WASD or the arrow keys with shift and spacebar as the jump button. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press Escape or q to quit. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61e44c77f3d776ef0582955f1d5eedb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fabdynamic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
