My name is Calae and I am learning UE5. I am following a course on GameDev.tv, linked here. This is the first finished project out of 5! I will be challenging myself after completing each project to think of a couple new additions I can make to the game to make it more fun. <strong>Version 2 released!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this game you are a free flying pawn that shoots cannonballs from your face! You have 20 cannonballs to fire at the various objects within the scene to cause chaos.\u00a0 The top left corner will have messages showing how much ammo you have left. Once you run out of ammo, firing will instead start a timer to reset the level. The controls in this game are simple.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong>: Move around</li><li><strong>Space Bar</strong>: Fire a cannonball</li><li><strong>Escape</strong>: Exit the game</li></ul>\n<p>Go in and have some fun wrecking the warehouse!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f40707e164f7adce0228e7fc20a114a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
