Thriving in the balance are stars seeking the energy of others to live, while not being consumed themselves. You are a newly born star, attempting to thrive for as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>OVERVIEW, OBJECTIVE AND CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overview :.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The player controls a white star. Your energy is your health -- when you run out of energy, it's game over.</li><li>You can dash by pressing X (on Xbox Controller), which increases your speed for a few seconds.</li><li>Tap A (on Xbox Controller) to fire a few Sparks. Sparks will target and chase after <strong>Red Stars</strong> for you for ten seconds, damaging them over time. Your \"Spark Count\" tells you how many Sparks you currently have flying around the map. <ul><li><strong>**DON'T HOLD DOWN A**</strong> or you'll fire too many and die from energy loss! You don't need many to do damage! Less is more!</li></ul></li><li>Entering the outside ring of <strong>Blue Stars </strong>restores your energy. However, staying inside too long will turn them into Red Stars. Be quick and careful! (Try skimming their edge instead of entering them fully)</li><li>Entering the outside ring of <strong>Red Stars </strong>will consume your energy. Hitting their cores directly (the solid, red ball in the middle) results in a game-over.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Objective :.</strong></p>\n<p>Turn all the Red Stars into Blue Stars! </p>\n<p>Sparks will damage the Red Stars over time, turning them into Blue Stars. Their cores will turn bluer the closer they are to turning.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(USES XBOX CONTROLLER)</strong></p>\n<p>X Button ---------- Dash<br/></p>\n<p>A Button ---------- Fire Sparks</p>\n<p>Analog Stick ----- Movement</p>\n<p> \u014cra was made in three weeks as a final student project at Long Island University - LIU Post, in the Digital Game Design and Development program. Most of the project was developed by myself, and music was created as a kind gesture by Eric Guadara, a fellow graduate student of the program. Any assets used were acquired by the Unity Asset store, and were paid in-full and credited appropriately in game. <br/></p>\n<p>I plan on continuing to update the game over the summer, including adding more sound effects, a tutorial mode and other polishing effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f09c8b4ac065b7aae81408e7da6dc8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sylaren"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
