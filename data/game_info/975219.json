{"id": 975219, "slug": "slime-brawly-brawl", "name": "Slime Brawly Brawl", "name_original": "Slime Brawly Brawl", "description": "An early prototype, Slime Brawly Brawl exists to scratch an itch. An itch for a simple, fast paced platformer melee game like 90s kids might have played and loved growing up.<br/><br/>Current build is a solo infinite run game where you battle your way up the levels against increasingly powerful opponents. There is only one attack, there is only one map, and there is only one opponent (or is there...). It is what it is: a prototype for something that could be fun in a future build.<br/><br/>With enough player interest to continue development, the milestones are (roughly): <br/><br/><ul><li> 0.0.0: initial prototype, smash attack only, solo infinite run mode only (&lt;- you are here)<br/></li><li> 0.1.0: in-house Slime models, refactor prefabs/code, polish UI, add Steam achievements<br/></li><li> 0.2.0: new actions: grapple and ranged<br/></li><li> 0.3.0: local multiplayer vs<br/></li><li> 0.4.0: local 2v2 co-op<br/></li><li> 0.5.0: local 2v2 vs<br/></li><li> 0.6.0 through 0.9.0: multiple Slimes, skins, maps, potentially skill point trees, community feedback based updates, patches, and creative direction<br/></li><li> 1.0.0: online pvp and 2v2/3v3 vs (&lt;- a legit engineering challenge I'd love to conquer)</li></ul><br/>This game sucks, I guarantee it! That said if you can squint and see what I see, any support, wishlists and sharing to friends/communities would help grind through that list of milestones. For the moment this is a solo-dev project, so to reiterate... it is what it is, fun for the sake of itself.
