{"id": 393161, "slug": "pew-pew-the-galactic-enigma", "name": "Pew Pew: The Galactic Enigma", "name_original": "Pew Pew: The Galactic Enigma", "description": "<p>This alpha/demo game is one I put together in about 3-4 days. I had an idea for some kind of puzzle game, but I didn't have any way to make it original until I saw the theme for the contest. Then I decided to make the main character a cat! It is a sci-fi puzzle game where you play as a cat, named Pew Pew, from the future. You are sent to this strange planet to discover a strange anomaly only to find a planet riddled with puzzle which hide some powerful secret to the galaxy.</p>\n<p>ATTENTION - There are some small minor bugs. Also, some parts are widely unfinished (such as typo errors here and there.) My time was really tight due to my classes for college. This is actually my first game I have ever built, finished, packaged and uploaded for others so bear with me if there are bugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[one thing, there is no main menu screen, and the only way to exit the game is 'alt+tab' then right-click the application and close it, sorry about that. I'll be sure to add one for the next build of the game]</p>\n<p>Thank- you to:</p>\n<p>Thank you to EPIC games for all of their content and every other content creator on the Marketplace!
