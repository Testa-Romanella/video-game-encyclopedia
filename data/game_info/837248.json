What is this mysterious debt that they're being forced to pay? Is it just me, or does everyone here seem to be... weirdly into Riley?\u00a0 Can you save Riley from their fated ending?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a completed demo of the real game, Monster Hunter's Love, and is intended to tease the story.
