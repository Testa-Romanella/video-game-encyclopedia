Is it moral to kill baby Hitler? Would you spare the burning of the Library of Alexandria but destroy everything written to Wikipedia?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game includes two modes- Free Play and Utilitarian Mode. In Free Play you can make choices as you see fit and in Utilitarian Mode you are encouraged to make decisions that are considered the most ethical according to the utilitarian characters in the game where you can accumulate points and a streak for agreeing with them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game currently has more than 500 ethical decisions which take around 30 seconds each, which means the game currently has over 4 hours of gameplay (or even more if you like to read!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game will include links to different pages where you can argue with other players about what the correct ethical decision is.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf the game gets popular enough we will add the ability to create your own problem and share it with the world!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/7224493bfb557020c1c545614bc4bb20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Newfa"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Newfa"], "esrb_rating": null}
