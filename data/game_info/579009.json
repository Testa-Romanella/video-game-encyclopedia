And, naturally, laundry is one of the many gateways into those other places. Does it make sense? Probably not. Find items that other people lost ages ago. Approach the washing machine, and it will take you from there. When you've found what you've been looking for, get back to the awkwardly placed washing machine. You may need to visit the same place multiple times. Try not to fall or swim. If you are really walking around aimlessly, consider enabling hints.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77b9b9d2a071ba58f82e01fbe34f9d9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["animakozak"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
