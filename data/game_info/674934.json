Despite the dangerous creatures that live around the treasure, he decides to go anyways, the allure of treasure being irresistible. What will await him?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MORE GAMEPLAY INFO:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Utilize both Hex Chain and Hex Blink to navigate the stages the way you want to. The orange bar is his aura bar, and can only be refilled by attacking with his Aura Spear. Hex Chain throws out a long ranged chain, and will pull Acro towards an enemy or terrain that it hits, while Hex Blink is a dash that makes him intangible, but has a higher cost. Both spells are omni-directional, so their potential are limitless.</p>\n<p>MAC AND LINUX VERSION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO\u00a0COME OUT ANYTIME SOON!
