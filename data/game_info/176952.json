Once you place one shape on a button, rotate it, and then select the other. Place it, then reselect the first, and rotate it to match the button.</strong><br/></em></p><p><em>IMPORTANT: Please leave honest and blunt feedback. Saying something is alright when it isn't doesn't help me learn. Be brutal.</em></p><p><strong>Theme: Shapeshift</strong></p><p>Best with headphones.</p><p>You play as a phantom that can hop from object to object to open a portal to hop through.<br/>However, you can only hope to an object that has the same shape as the one you currently are possessing. Circles to circles, squares to squares, rectangles to rectangles and squares, etc.<br/>You can also rotate objects to give them a new shape. Hence, you are a shape-shifter.</p><p>Instructions are in the game, but here you go anyways:</p><p>Click to possess an object,</p><p>WASDQE to rotate that object,</p><p>Spacebar to toggle between phantom mode (rotation and possession) and normal mode (movement),</p><p>WASD while in normal mode to move an object,</p><p>R or escape restarts the level.</p><p>Put objects of the corresponding shape on all of the buttons in order to complete open the portal. Click on the portal to complete the level.</p><p>Have fun! Please let me know all of your thoughts, both good and bad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Halleflux"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
