As a child, the boy was bitten by a seagull, and now he is Captain Seagull. He became angry because all seagulls are evil! There is also Doctor Oil. He is also angry, but the seagull is angrier. Therefore, Doctor Butter decided to kill Captain Seagull and went on a journey. He has to go through 75 difficult levels (I'm sure your maximum is level 28). These levels are divided into 5 unique locations. Each location has its own peculiarity. Good luck).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T17:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9df83b17b4bf62370b858af0a278fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 62, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antena"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Antena"], "esrb_rating": null}
