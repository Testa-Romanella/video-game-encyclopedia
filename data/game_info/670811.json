It's the product of watching LOADS of Unity Tutorials on Youtube,  countless hours goofing around in Photoshop and even more time banging  my head against the wall because I did not know what I was doing.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Capybara Echoes</strong> will have a hybrid narrative style. Some parts of the story will be told as a visual novel (<em>with b</em><em>ranching</em>) while other parts will be more 'playable', similar to this platformer.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Try to collect all electron tubes and defeat all enemies in this demo. There might be a nice reward at the end ;) <br/></p>\n<p>You can follow the project on Instagram and Twitter (@capybaraechoes).</p>\n</em></em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60e07960cb7c2b59892738a69d6a7d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cesargaming"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
