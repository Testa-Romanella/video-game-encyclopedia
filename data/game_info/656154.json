The goal is to park cars by tracing them a path towards their assigned parking slot. You gain one point for every car parked and lose two for every car that has an accident. You can press W to speed up the last car your mouse hovered over or S to slow it down.\u00a0If your score goes under -5 you lose. You can either play the levels with a goal, meaning you have to get a certain number of points to win, or in endless mode, where you cannot win and instead are given a highscore. Hope you enjoy. Would be good if you read the guide in the main menu, on the right side of the screen before playing.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully all the exports work...</p><p>Sfx made with bfxr and sprites made with pixlr and pixilart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daa9c50d1222899dc8468efb7b8c96b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mewoooo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
