It was created during the 2013 UofT Game Making Deathmatch - a time when I was totally obsessed with XCOM. I wanted to try and take the experience of XCOM and condense it into a faster paced (albeit simpler) form. Since the first release, I pushed out a few extra updates adding grenades, a local multiplayer mode, and multiple difficulty levels</p><p> YCOM has been featured on IndieGames.com as a Freeware Pick. It was also showcased on IndieStalk and VideoGamerTV.</p><p>If you have any comments about the game, or are interested in other games I've made, check out my website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/47447a8d8f0eabfc819d100f4f932551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adamgryu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
