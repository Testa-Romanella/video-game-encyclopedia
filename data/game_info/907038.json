{"id": 907038, "slug": "indiepocalypse-36", "name": "Indiepocalypse #36", "name_original": "Indiepocalypse #36", "description": "ISSUE #36\r\nCover - Bryce Oquaye (comics, twitter, instagram)\r\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Hello and welcome to Indiepocalypse!</p>\n<p>Indiepocalypse is a curated monthly collection looking to highlight the very best of the alternative indie game scene.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each month features games by 10 different developers, including a newly commissioned game exclusive to the bundle-zine. The games cover a wide variety of styles, genres, and themes as they fight against any definition of \"indie game\" as a genre.</p>\n<p>Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each contributor is paid\u00a0and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.</p>\r\nThis Month's Games\r\n<br/>Sleep at Night (Game Boy) by\u00a0Brooklynn Whidden\r\n\n<p>Explore your family's estate and interact with the environment to find clues that help you remember the events that took place earlier that evening. Discover multiple endings to this tragic story.</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nMon Samsara (WIN) by\u00a0Jean-Christophe Pelletier - Productions Fougarou\r\n\n<p>Mon Samsara is a transformative game exploring our life habits. By playing Mon Samsara, you get to gently orient the development of a human being and choose how to fill his or her life with objects and people to make it all worthwhile. These bonds impact when and how it all ends. But what is the meaning of it all? Only you can know the answer.</p>\n<p>A play session lasts approximately 12 minutes and players are encouraged to replay the game to deepen their understanding of the game's underlying systems, values and their perspective on them. The evocative nature of its graphics and music and its lack of a clear goal stimulate the player to build their own emergent narrative.</p>\n\n\r\nSpindlewheel Microgames (Physical) by\u00a0Sasha Reneau\r\n\n<p>Spindlewheel Microgames features a whodunit, a cthonic god-freeing game, a train chatting sim, a duel to the death, and a mapmaking game using interpretive cards and procgen mechanics. Both bespoke and fatalistic, incredibly personal and predetermined, Spindlewheel uses a deck that is fantastically exploratory and has a penchant for reading for filth.</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nIt Started With Hairs (WIN/MAC/Linux/Android) by\u00a0Gary Chadwick\r\n\n\n<p>A short, text heavy visual novel about the horror of having a body. Content warning: Contains descriptions of self harm and body horror.</p>\n\n\r\nMatter (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0PRINCESS INTERNET CAF\u00e9, Ellis Dex &amp; Bb\r\n\n<p>A group of rebel ex-corporate scientists jump onto the spaceship Vantage to investigate the birth of a quasar. But will astrophysics be a simpler matter than solving their interpersonal issues?<br/></p>\n\n\r\nRamiel (WIN/MAC/Linux/Browser) by\u00a0Ramona Synesthesia\r\n\n<p>Ramiel is a short text-based game about realizing that thing you have been holding back is real, important, and vivid. It is a game about wings, bodies, and hope. More than anything, it is a true story, one that could be your true story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day we will all find our wings, little angel.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nLabor rights funeral in Ukraine (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0Valeriy Petrov\r\n\n<p>The plot of this game is a work of fiction. But the attack on the labor rights of Ukrainians and the draft of the new anti-labor law do exist, unfortunately. Explore what it means to be buried alive.</p>\n\r\nBRAINSTORMED 2: DEATH IS NOT THE END or, HYPERPHANTASIA (WIN) by\u00a0MDEV0\r\n\n<p>Abstract religious melodrama with light first-person platforming.
