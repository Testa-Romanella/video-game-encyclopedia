If you think this is too much, options to lower the price include but are not limited to: planting trees, reducing car use, organising in protest, voting against fossil fuels, eating the rich and recycling your plastics. Your money is not wasted though, as a minimum of $10 from every sale will go towards planting a New Zealand native tree through treesthatcount..\u00a0</p>\n<p>How is this related to the Twitter bot?<br/>Think of this game as a B-side remix to This, Too, Shall Pass. The Twitter bot connects to the main version of this game which is in circulation on a small number of USB keys all around the world.</p>\n<p>How do I get the version that\u2019s posting on the bot?<br/>For now, the only way to get that is to be given it by someone who has it. If that version of the game ever does get a public release, I promise that anyone who owns the B-side will get a copy of those for free, but there\u2019s currently no plans to do that in the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af75438f130ad7d7682e5cd3bbdc3c19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OldLoths"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
