{"id": 660102, "slug": "dead-clones", "name": "Dead Clones", "name_original": "Dead Clones", "description": "<p>A nervous roguelite platformer set in a gloomy sci-fi dungeon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Run</strong>, <strong>jump</strong> and <strong>slash</strong> your way across dark coridors, slaughter clones, loot what they left behind to challenge CRUSH3R, protector of the dark realm, and start again when he kills you.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Dead Clones is a free fan game with obvious inspirations made with love (and Game Maker Studio) by only me.\u00a0\u00a0</em><em>Your character awakes in a dark and strange place with no memories. Why he is there is not clear... but he feels the urge to hack'n'slash at everything that moves. Good for him, the cold\u00a0rooms are filled with agressive clones!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>FIGTH3R Release 22 - Early Game Play - Windows only</strong></p>\n<p>The game is ready with minimalists content: a linear run across 3 areas, 8 enemies, 10 upgrades, and a boss. A full run should take you 10 minutes but CRUSH3R is a viscious, almost unfair, boss. If you are lucky you'll find usefull upgrades \u00a0along the way\u00a0(faster kunai, longer combo, air dash...) and you might collect enough DNA orbs to improve your body for the next runs.</p>\n\r\nupgrades alter how you run, jump, dash, slash, climb.... \r\n\r\nDodge traps...\r\n\r\nKill clones again and again\r\n\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is a tutorial but in a nutshell;\u00a0you\u00a0can<strong>\u00a0double jump</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>wall jump</strong>, you will need to\u00a0<strong>slide a lot</strong>\u00a0to avoid attacks of all kind and ripost with a\u00a0<strong>3 hit combo</strong>\u00a0(ground/air), air slam or your\u00a0<strong>lazer kunai</strong>. You will need to rebind keys (I advise gamepad) because they are not convenient at all.</p>\n\r\nRemap gamepad / keyboard / mouse\r\n\n<p>Try to have\u00a0your name up the highscores board\u00a0by completing your run quickly... and without dying.\u00a0<br/></p>\nWill you challenge enderslash?\n\n<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>\n<p>There are some known bugs and weakness (unpolished boss &amp; stuff, inconsistent\u00a0audio, missing content) but the project covers the features\u00a0I was trying to build, so I am not sure how much additional energy I'll put into that. I really hope you will have fun playing it !\u00a0<em>Oh.. and beware of trap when rushing in a new room.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33e40882b042cd551126121c2232ae3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MichelV"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
