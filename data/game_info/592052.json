She's out discovering the world and its secrets, on a quest to find Lumens (the small flames). At first, she seems like she's only made of darkness that can turn into pure shadow in the dark, but her heart is made of light, her eyes and is able to show through her flowy bright hair and through her tattoos. The balance of shadow and light also allows her to have a physical body. She consumes the Lumens she can find to keep that inner fire alive.</p>\n\n<p>\"Lumen x Ombra\" is a 2D platformer game developed by a small team for the \"B&amp;W Jam\". It is currently a prototype, but we hope to be able to improve it and add some additional levels, maybe also functionalities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:52:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a07/a07a90dc6d8323c6ea00d63e15ebefc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tudor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
