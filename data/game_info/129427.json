Try not to get ran over!\u00a0My first Ludum Dare jam.</p>\n<p>-------<br/>How to play<br/>-------<br/>Play using the four arrow keys. Press the arrow key that matches the arrows onscreen as they enter the highlighted area at the bottom left. Missing an arrow spawns obstacles which knock the player back. You lose when the player gets hit by the truck. The game gets faster and harder over time.</p>\n<p>-------<br/>Future<br/>-------<br/>A lot happened over the weekend so I only had around 4-8 hours to work on the game. Eventually, I want to finish the art, find better sound and music that matches the input timing, implement the ability for the game to require multiple inputs at a time, etc. I think it came out pretty well considering how long I worked on it myself though. The truck was supposed to be a horde of zombies and pressing certain directions was going to be more interactive like pressing up would make the player jump and something would spawn in time for the player to jump over it, but I didn\u2019t have the time. You can probably tell I had to rush at the last second to add the background and truck, that\u2019s why it\u2019s far less detailed than everything else. Hopefully I\u2019ll get to finish all that soon and if I do I\u2019ll upload a separate version on my itch.io.</p>\n<p>-------<br/>Contact<br/>-------<br/>Follow me on twitter!<br/>@Domiiinance</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6d2839bbd4ef2e29938884135539fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Reign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
