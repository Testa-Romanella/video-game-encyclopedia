You have made it your mission to close the breach once and for all.</p>\n<p>Fight your way to the old church, through the strange woods\u00a0 surrounding it. It is said that terrible creatures lurk in there ... They could compromise your plans. If you fail to enter the church in time, you will regret every step you took on this  cursed ground.</p>\n<p>There is a way for you to stay safe and sound. You possess the most archaic form of magic: salt. Tracing around you and on your way should be enough to keep the monsters away for a while. But beware, this magic is not as powerful as the forces that haunt this place. Salt once set will not protect you forever.<br/></p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>Arrow keys</strong> or <strong>WASD</strong> to move<br/><br/><strong>Left mouse button </strong>to draw with the salt<br/><br/><strong>E </strong>; <strong>Space</strong> ; <strong>Left</strong> mouse button to interact</p>\n<p>No key to run.
