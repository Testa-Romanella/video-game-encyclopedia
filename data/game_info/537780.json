How quickly can you do it?</p>\n<p>Use X/Z to light a match - be warned, it won't stay lit for long! You can't see treasure or keys without light, and you can't pick up what you can't see. The monsters in the house will pursue you and will blow out your match if they get close. If they catch you, they'll steal your key and treasure to hide them in the house again.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Toy Box Jam 2020!
