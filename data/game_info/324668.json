(I.e. Components in instantiated prefabs that need to have a reference to the current countdown timer.)<br/> Interface implementations of the Model classes are then extracted from the class instances and then registered into Zenject for dependency injection purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>rView</strong><br/> Classes that observe data from injected models and reactively manipulate its own member variables (like base elements) for display.<br/> No game logic embodied in these kind of classes. They just observe or \"get\" values from models, maybe format or process them too, and relay them to their member variables.</p>\n<p><strong>rPresenter</strong><br/> Classes that both observe and manipulate values from models injected into them. They have the responsibility to guide the models and use the \"setter\" methods to cause changes to the values, which in turn are reactively acted upon by rViews.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Game Engine:</strong> Unity3D 2019.1</p>\n<p><strong>Plugins Used:</strong><br/> - Zenject (for dependency injection)<br/> - UniRx (for reactive extensions)<br/> <br/><strong>Packages Imported:</strong><br/> - TextMeshPro<br/> - Cartoon Particle 2D FX</p>\n<p>Other Assets Imported:<br/> - Free 2D art from various artists and websites.
