It features\u00a0\u00a0basic collision detection with primitives, self-collision, procedural thickness, and a huge array of parameters. Performant enough to run natively on Quest 2.</p>\n<p>The demo is meant to showcase the system and how it can enhance immersion in VR games. You can play with two types of cloth - the gray one simulates more standard materials, while the darker, brown one attempts to simulate leather-like materials. Try to fold them!</p>\n<p>This is currently an initial prototype version, so issues are expected. For example, there's only very simplified friction, so cloth objects will slide around. Bending forces aren't stable either, you can expect some moving around.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nLeft thumbstickLocomotionRight thumbstickRotationTrigger buttonsPinch the clothGrip buttonsGrab the clothXSpeed up simulation<br/>YSlow down simulationRight thumbstick clickSwitch showcase\r\n<p>Pinching with triggers grabs a specific part of the cloth, allowing precise manipulation, while grip buttons will grab a large part surrounding your controllers. Switching showcases can take a moment. Only tested with Quest 2 controllers, but any should work.<br/></p>\n<p>The APK version has been built for Quest 2. I cannot guarantee it working with any other standalone headsets, as I don't have them and can't test them. The PC version should work with any SteamVR-compatible headset. It should run well on any VR-capable PC.</p><p>If you have any feedback, please leave it below, or message me on Twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:42:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c11ae43911080864ded7ea9e95abd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Matusson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
