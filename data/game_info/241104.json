Sam is a bartender at the Nirvana bar, where she serves all kinds of patrons looking for peace in this bustling megacity. Leon, on the other hand, is a gangster at a crossroads in life. Where should his allegiance lie? Family, or &quot;family&quot;?<br />\nGameplay consists of preparing all manner of cocktails using the available ingredients - and unlike Glitch City, Nirvana doesn&#39;t deal in synthetic alcohol substitutes. Splash out on whisky, rum and vodka to your heart&#39;s desire, rather than just following an order to advance through the story! You decide what kind of drink to serve for any and every occasion. Pay close attention to your patron&#39;s needs, and serve the drink that will change their lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/278e845b0ed954382ab322d8e71a8599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sukeban Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM", "Ysbryd Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
