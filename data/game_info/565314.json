You can use your bees to sting enemies, but be aware that doing so will disable said bees. Defeating enemies increases your honey (the number at the bottom). Honey decreases with time, and if you run out of it, the game ends. You have to collect a certain amount of honey to advance to the next level, so keep stinging beetles.</p>\n<p>Made for the b3agz game jam</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Lowe-e: programming</p>\n<p>Zackey: music\u00a0 \u00a0 IG:\u00a0@manex_immel</p>\n<p>Cami: art\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IG:\u00a0@kaneda.pnguwu</p>\n<p>Alex: art\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IG:\u00a0@alexander_63sf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T04:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b855e994b33bd981bf86d66b6b468d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lowe-e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
