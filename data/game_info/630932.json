I've been working hard on this for about 6 months now while\u00a0working full-time as a game writer for Wolcen Studio. It has taken longer than I'd like, but I hope to write future chapters more quickly in the future, and when each one is finished I'll\u00a0just update the game to include them. Oh, and if you enjoy the experience, please let me know in the comments, or email me (james.symondnicholls@gmail.com). If you don't enjoy it, I would love to hear why so\u00a0I can take that feedback into the writing of future chapters.
