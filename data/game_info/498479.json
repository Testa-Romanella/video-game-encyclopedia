To start the game, move until the title fades, then a single square of static appears, moving onto this square starts the first puzzle. When puzzles are completed, this square of static will appear again.<br/></p>\n<p>The automata used in this is 'non-transitive'; red eats blue, green eats red, and blue eats green. To complete a stage, the player needs to disrupt this cycle by drawing white lines (hold left shift while moving). <br/></p>\n<p><strong>In short, breaking the cycle lets the automata burn out.</strong></p>\n<p>When the player moves into a colored region, they take on a secondary color that is a mixture of the two 'safe colors'. Whenever the player moves onto the other 'safe color' they will take on the new secondary color that indicates the new 'safe colors'.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>R =&gt; Magenta =&gt; Safe on R &amp; B</li><li>B =&gt; Cyan =&gt; Safe on B &amp; G</li><li>G =&gt; Yellow =&gt; Safe on G &amp; R</li></ul>\n<p>If the player moves on to the 'unsafe color', they will display static and be unable to draw the disrupting lines for several ticks.</p>\n<p><strong>In short, moving against the vortices of the automata counts against the player.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba46cce2a6b01a489f8bb75ede6b6486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cottontshirtz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
