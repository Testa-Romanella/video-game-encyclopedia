It is the first title of the Mega Man Battle Network series of games. It was originally released in Japan as a GBA launch game on March 21, 2001 and was released later that year in North America and Europe. It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on July 9, 2014, in Europe on July 24, 2014, and in North America on July 31, 2014.<br />\nBattle Network takes place during the 21st century in a world where society and everyday life is driven by the internet. Users are able to interact with and virtually explore nearly any electronic device using highly advanced, online avatars called &quot;NetNavis&quot;. The game follows a young boy named Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE as they solve a series of crimes instigated by the &quot;WWW (World Three)&quot; organization. Rather than share the platform gameplay of its predecessors, Battle Network is a tactical role-playing game (RPG) in which the player respectively controls Lan in the game&#39;s outside world and MegaMan.EXE in its virtual world. Battles take place in real-time; special abilities called &quot;Battle Chips&quot; can be accessed to fight off the numerous computer viruses present in the game&#39;s cyberspace environments.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2001-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T21:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7cf/7cf66e3efb55bef21b58656d6a39925c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 12, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 13, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
