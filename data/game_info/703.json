In short, what is waiting the player can be called a crazy incendiary hack and slash with the third person perspective, where the endless action and anime style graphics converged. Some aspects of the game are very reminiscent of Dark Souls.</p>\n<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>The story revolves around the corpse, which was suddenly revived. And yes - this is our main character if you can say so. Or the heroine - it depends on who you choose at the start screen. Anyway, if you die, you can just buy yourself a new shell and go on. There are a lot of locations to explore in the game. It depends on the player - exactly how to proceed - constantly using new bodies or to save money and after death to resurrect your favorite body. Note that it is very easy to die in this game. As for the goal - the player has to climb the tower, where at the very top lies the key to saving the whole world. There are more than forty floors in this tower. But this is only part of the story.</p>\n<h3>Change of plans</h3>\n<p>Initially, the game supposed to be called Lily Bergamo, but at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the name was changed to LET IT DIE. The development lasted no less than three and a half years. Also, the release date was unknown at some point, but developers managed to deliver. It came out on the model of Free to play, which attracted attention and received a lot of people who wanted to play.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2016-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T12:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d4a/d4a85e0d7676e4f9bce23f349e44e75e.jpg", "website": "https://www.letitdiethegame.com", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1928, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 255, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 326, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 327, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Grasshopper Manufacture", "Gungho Online", "SUPERTRICK  GAMES,Inc."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["GRASSHOPPER MANUFACTURE", "GungHo Online Entertainment America"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
