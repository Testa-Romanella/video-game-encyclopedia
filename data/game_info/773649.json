Another in my continuing 'retro' series, here's Frogger! Again following the extremely helpful tutorials provided by The Weekly Coder, I have managed to create another arcade-style game.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To be fair, I added several additions to his code which I'm quite proud of:\r\n</p>\r\n- Levels!\u00a0\r\n<p>Each time Frogger fills all the Home Bays the game will advance a level and the traffic, turtles, and logs will speed up. This continues through level 6; which caps the speed, but does not end the game. Additionally, I have added text to indicate the level that's starting each time the level increases. This leads me to the next point...\r\n</p>\r\n-\u00a0Text!\r\n<p>While I enjoy the simplicity of what The Weekly Coder left off with, I always try to give the player as much instructional aid as is required to play the game. In this case, the goal was to tell the player how to manipulate the actual operations of the overall game.\u00a0Which this leads me to...\r\n</p>\r\n- Pausing!\r\n<p>I added a method to pause the game during a level, as well as another to quit at any point. It was particularly necessary to allow the player to quit because the game forces a full-screen window due to the required resolution. Anyway...\r\n</p>\r\n- High Scores!\r\n<p>What's an arcade game without high scores? So I added the feature in to encourage more competitive gaming.\r\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p>* Arrow Keys - Move Frogger\r\n</p>\n<p>* Space Bar - Pause / Unpause\r\n</p>\n<p>* Esc - Quit\r\n</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<p>* You have 30 seconds (displayed via a countdown bar in the lower right), to get each frog across the board to one of the blue Home Bays.\r\n</p>\n<p>* Upon filling each Home Bay, Frogger will advance to the next level.\r\n</p>\n<p>*\u00a0Avoid hitting the traffic or touching the water, or Frogger will\u00a0lose a life.\r\n</p>\n<p>* Turtles can be stepped on if they're surfaced (red) or transitioning (blue), but if the turtles dive, then Frogger will touch the water and be killed. The change state every 5 seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>* Frogger's lives are displayed in the lower left via small dots. Each time Frogger is reset, a life will be removed. If all lives are lost, the game is over.\r\n</p>\r\nCURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT\r\n<p>I've had an especially fun time working on Frogger, and I think it's in large part to being able to add multiple additions on my own. As such, I plan to take some time to continue adding a few features I have planned. So stick around!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T15:50:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e013fe86aa5f1a585fa84ca5ed4020fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meter Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
