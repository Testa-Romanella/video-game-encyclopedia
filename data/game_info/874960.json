I have a handful of ideas for this project's direction - follow me to get updates as it grows.</p>\n<p>This game is currently contained in dino, my open source godot monorepo.</p><p>The inspiration for this game comes from running in park during the fall - or as I call it, Leaf-Catching Season. The beautifully colored leaves are a game to distract me from the distance remaining - catch as many as you can!\r\n </p>\n<p>I built a little process for putting rooms in front of the player until they are \u2018complete\u2019, so that\u2019s the game that\u2019s running (heh) right now.\r\n </p>\n<p>What I like so far:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>The \u2018room\u2019 api decouples the level creation pretty nicely - they don\u2019t depend on each other, and arbitrary \u2018sets of rooms\u2019 can be specified pretty easily in godot.\r\n</li><li>The auto-run makes for an simple experience for the player - this could end up working fairly well on mobile.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>I\u2019ll next fix the win-state for this \u2018Park\u2019 run, add some HUD elements, and then experiment with some more room design. I\u2019m hopeful to get into some procedural generation in the rooms themselves, or some cross-room tasks/keys/doors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I often stream development on this project via twitch.</p>\n<p>You can support me on patreon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T09:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca4/ca405d6774f51e18900d02da731e09b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["russmatney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
