ZzTBat's music and the pace of the game worked wonderfully, and I knocked it out of the park with polish. Unfortunately that comes at a cost of literally only three levels, one of which being a tutorial, but oh well, c'est, la vie.</p>\n<p>It's definitely going on the games-to-extend shortlist, though!<br/><br/>I also think I did a good job with the music ;) - Zz\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T19:40:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea5661ec3db3cd7bb39c59069974d125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScarfRavenStudios", "ZzTBat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
