Designed from the ground up to accurately simulate aerobatic flight, it allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to strap into a high-performance stunt plane and take to the sky. Take control of an aerobatic airplane, throttle up, and discover what you can do. There\u2019s no navigation, no radios - just a lot of horsepower in a state-of-the-art aircraft.Exciting Features</p>\n<p>High Speed Racing: Challenging Entertainment<br />\nVirtual Reality Immersion: Oculus, SteamVR, or Windows Mixed Reality<br />\nExpansive World Design: Hundreds of Thousands of Square Miles to Explore<br />\nEnvironmental Controls: Wind, Precipitation, Daylight At Your Command<br />\nStunning Visual Detail: Powered by Unigine2<br />\nImpressive Physics: Accurate, Predictive, Component Based Simulation<br />\nMulti-controller Support: Use Your Multi-USB Cockpit SystemController Required!</p>\n<p>Acro FS requires a controller to run.
