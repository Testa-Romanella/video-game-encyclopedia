There are a lot of contents missing but we still have approximately 3 months of production time, so here's a raw build for you guys to try it out! :D</p>\n<p>Do keep in mind that we are aware of the followings that should be in the game but due to time constraints, we couldn't make it in time :( -\u00a0<br/>- Level background<br/>- Sound<br/>- Shop and Inventory UI<br/>- Moveset variants<br/>- Item drops and chest loots</p>\n<p>Is it bad?
