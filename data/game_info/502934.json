{"id": 502934, "slug": "heres-christine-the-game", "name": "|Here's Christine (The Game)", "name_original": "|Here's Christine (The Game)", "description": "<p><strong>Name</strong></p><p>REDACTED</p><p><strong>Project Title</strong></p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Christine\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathway Choice - Rationale</strong></p>\n<p>Coding, some would consider it another language, comparable to spanish or german, to me, I personally think it\u2019s more like another set of languages. over the years I have learnt scratch to python and now C#. I never thought of myself as an artist but I personally have always enjoyed coding, so I thought i should focus on the coding aspect compared to something I am considerably less skilled at, such as 3d modelling in Maya or other programs.</p>\n<br/><p>Project Concept</p>\n<p><strong>OUTLINE</strong></p>\n<p>My idea is a horror game based on the film / book of \u201cChristine\u201d by Stephen King. In this game you will be at the top of a multi story carpark. You have to get to the bottom before christine sees you and tries to kill you. You will be on foot and it will be a dimly lit area, with the brightest light coming from christine\u2019s headlights (when the player is spotted, la cucaracha car horn will play.)\u00a0 there will be a few cars to hide behind so that the game is easier. The player will also be the first person the game and there will be no set date the game takes place. The music will consist of the music from the film, but remixed in a slightly different way, to make it more modern. The cars to hide behind will be popular cars that I personally love. In the game each on each floor there will be a door to stairs which when entered it will say \u201care you running away like a scaredy cat?\u201d If yes is clicked, then it will quit and close the game. If not, the game will resume.The colors will be dark use of black brown setting, with a bright distinctive red car about and blood splatters in certain spots. The power ups will make the car explode which will play a clip from the movie (small box in a corner most likely) where it rebuilds itself, then it will keep going. - good.</p>\n<p>Gameplay Mechanics</p>\n<p>I will need Player movement scripts, Car random movement script and Powerup script (blows up car when collected, which switches it to a wrecked car. It then plays the scene where it fixes itself, spawns in a normal car at the same point and keeps going.) </p>\n<p>Sounds when button pressed, a playlist script (if using music) and a lose exit door (wusses wuss out and lose game) which is also part of win lose condition. speaking of win lose items i will also need Win lose triggers (see if car hits player or if player makes it out)</p>\n<p>There are only a few things i will need for the menu ui such as Buttons. the buttons needed are Pause button code, Restart button code and Exit button code. I will also need a slider for the volume of the audio. a Scene manager scripts would also be useful for the buttons.</p>\n<p>Finally the last scripts I need are the Animation scripts, Floor counter, which is a trigger that how many floors down the player goes, Time.wait code which will be used to delay certain code and a Speed of movement script is also needed.</p>\n<p>The target Platform is PC and the controls are basic movement controls, such as \u201cw/a/s/d/\u201d and \u201cmouse\u201d. The only real character is the car (christine) who is chasing the player.</p>\n<p>You are basically crashed into by christine in a car pack, wrecking your car. so you have to try and get out without being hit.</p>\n<p>The look will be a more modernised 1970s in the style of back to the future and blade runner, however we won't see much of this because we will be stuck in a gloomy grey and foggy car park. The car park will be wet, there will be blood in spots and it will be dark. The subject matter is\u00a0 based on the film / book of \u201cChristine\u201d by Stephen King. In this game you will be at the top of a multi story carpark. You have to get to the bottom before christine sees you and tries to kill you. You will be on foot and it will be a dimly lit area, with the brightest light coming from christine\u2019s headlights (when the player is spotted, la cucaracha car horn will play.)\u00a0 The music will consist of the music from the film, but remixed in a slightly different way, to make it more modern.The player will also be the first person in the game and there will be no set date the game takes place.\u00a0 The cars to hide behind will be popular cars that I personally love. The colors will be dark use of blacky brown setting, with a bright distinctive red car about and blood splatters in certain spots.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>IDEAS GENERATION</strong></p>\n<p>This all started with one game, that had more of an impact than thought, NFS HEAT. My original play was a game with the style of heat and gameplay of smashy road, but due to difficulty I decided to make another game idea. A game about a car, which car? Christine of course.</p>\n\n<p>I then thought about the location, and I thought what is somewhere where a car should stay? A car park of course. And because this story is based in the american 70s, it's in a multi story car park and for the name, I thought about King\u2019s other work, such as, the shining, in which the iconic line \u201cHERE\u2019S JOHNNY\u201d is said, and that's why the name of the game is \u201cHERE\u2019S CHRISTINE\u201d. A few more reasons are below.</p>\n<p>VISUAL ASSETS</p>\n<p>There are many visual assets I need, such as the model for Christine the car as well as basic cars for the player to hide behind. The exterior will need a night sky. When the car is destroyed from the powerup a clip from the movie will play in the bottom left corner which is car rebuilding itself (from movie) to show the player how much time they have left. As the game is first person I am wondering if I will even need a player hand. Another of the important visual assets needed will be the carpark location, which will contain an exit, which will allow the player to win. throughout the car park there will be blood on random points. There will be very few lights making the game a dark styled game with the main light coming from the corner of the building and headlights from the car itself.\u00a0 I will also need a win screen as well as a lose screen for both outcomes (such as hit by car or running off.). Lastly, the menu and UI as a whole will have a theme of red (similar to both the car and blood.</p>\n<p>AUDIO ASSETS\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a good selection of audio assets I need, for the car I will need the car engine (As before, the Fury's \"power pack\" engine was available for any 1958 Plymouth. Optional for all models, including Fury, was a new 350-cid wedge-head V-8. Called \"Golden Commando,\" it pumped out 305 or 315 horsepower -- the latter via fuel injection. (V8 Basically)). Car sounds are also needed such as the tires as it turns, accelerates, slows down and stops. I also need the La cucaracha car horn for when the player is spotted by the ai car, speaking of the player, I will also need the sound of footsteps and we will also need the sound of the door opening and closing for one of the outcomes. Ollie screaming for the players death sound is needed for when the player is killed by the car hitting the player as well as the crash sound for the car killing the player. Lastly, we need the sound of the explosion for when powerup is used. And for music we desperately need the main theme from movies and any music from 1958 to 1980.</p>\n<p>INTERACTIVE ASSETS/SCRIPTS</p>\n<p>The target Platform is PC and the controls are basic movement controls, such as \u201cw/a/s/d/\u201d and \u201cmouse\u201d. The only real character is the car (christine) who is chasing the player. you are basically crashed into by christine in a car pack, wrecking your car. so you have to try and get out without being hit.</p>\n<p>I will need Player movement,\u00a0 Powerups which will blow up the car when collected, which switches it to a wrecked car. It then plays the scene where it fixes itself, spawns in a normal car at the same point and keeps going. Sounds when are button pressed would be nice as well as a Playlist script to randomly play music from the era. Another thing is a Lose exit door when the player takes the easy way out, which is also part of win lose items. Speaking of win lose items, I will also need Win lose triggers to see if the car hits the player or if the player makes it out without being hit.</p>\n<p>There are only a few things I will need for the menu ui such as clickable buttons. The buttons which are needed are a Pause button, a Restart button code and an Exit button. I will also need a slider for the volume of the audio and a Scene manager for swapping scenes based on if won / lost / paused / restarted and exited.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 3: Evaluation</strong></p>\n<p>I will evaluate my work using a collection of quotes from peer reviewers, teachers and myself. I will also add the date these were said and then get them to react to the finished product to compare the difference. I personally will review positively then review again negatively. And lastly I will make an overall judgement on the project as a whole.</p>\n<p>I personally will review positively then review again negatively. And lastly I will make an overall evaluative judgement on the project as a whole.</p>\n<p>I will note down each destion, desired outcome and then the choice / real outcome and effect, whether it's good or bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will document changes to work both with references to reviews from peers and response to the reference, as well as note down all updates, outcomes and to do items on my development log.</p>\n<p>As I will base my world around ideas or suggestions from quotes, this can help me to be guided in the right direction. And I will be able to compare my current project to the finished product to be able to compare the difference. I will note down each destion, desired outcome and then the choice / real outcome and effect, whether it's good or bad. If it's a bad outcome I will work on fixing the outcome. This can help me to not leave the last week to bug fixing and finding.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Research Sources and Bibliography (Harvard Format)</strong></p>\n<p>List your initial research sources, both primary and secondary, that you intend to use.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sources should include libraries, galleries, books, magazines, films, computer games, websites, blogs, social media, Youtube videos etc.</p>\n<p>Primary research</p><ul><li>I asked opinions from multiple people.</li><li>I have played a plethora of games and based gameplay on a mix of them (FORZA HORIZON / MOTORSPORTS / NFS/ GRID / WRECKFEST / GRAN TURISMO / OTHER.)</li><li>personal view of christine related things, such as the film ( and theories)</li></ul>\n<p>Secondary research</p><ul><li>King, S.
