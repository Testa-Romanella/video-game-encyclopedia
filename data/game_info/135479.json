If you're determined to play the original, jump and change mass right at the start of Level3. If you don't break through the floor on your first attempt, you will have to exit to the main menu and select level 3 and try again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44a3e166b7c5b0848a7db34221a6274b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SyllabusGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
