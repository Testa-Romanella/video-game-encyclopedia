Run your ship into surrendered ships to grow your personal pirate fleet!</p>\n<p>This is my submission for the Kenney Game Jam, the theme of which was Growth. I looked through the assets on the Kenney website and was drawn to the pirate ships, so I decided to make an auto-attacker game where you grow not only your ship, but your own pirate fleet.</p>\n<p>It was probably too ambitious an idea for a 48 hour game jam. 24 more hours would have allowed for more polish, bug fixing, balancing, and complete systems. Ideally, I would have liked to have had in between run progression, better scaling on the power ups, and quite a few other things. But alas, this is where I landed. Maybe I'll work towards a fuller version if this project gains enough interest.</p>\n<p>If you are struggling to progress, I found an easy path to take to get strong quickly is:</p>\n<p>Increase Attack Rate until your cannon sounds like a machine gun -&gt; increase cannons until you feel like you are mowing things down -&gt; from there, increase health if you get low, otherwise increase turn speed a couple times for better evasive maneuvers -&gt; add more cannons lol, just be careful not to crash your computer ;)</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Anyways, it was a fun idea, and I had fun making it up until the final stretch. Now the only thing I care to enjoy is some sleep. Good night.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:08:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24320336eb49aa7104c039420ca50ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["One Flow Man"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
