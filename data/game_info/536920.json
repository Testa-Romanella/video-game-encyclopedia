Along the journey, these idiots run into some green dude who would like to turn them into dead people. Help them fight back and free Map Guy so I can forget about this horrible game.<br/><br/>Cool features in this 'game' include:<br/><ul><li> Draw custom maps of levels in order to navigate through them<br/></li><li> By the way you can't see when you are moving because you have to use a map while you are moving. I know, it's dumb<br/></li><li> Solve puzzles and get through short levels to advance through each chapter<br/></li><li> Meet some green clown who wants to kill you with a few lasers<br/></li><li> Horrendous art and music all made by me<br/></li><li> Get to know the 3 characters who you are trapped with on this stupid adventure<br/></li><li> Learn to regret buying this game<br/></li><li> Play through fun challenge levels which offer unique restrictions to challenge you I guess<br/></li><li> Why am I even making this<br/></li><li> Defeat cool bosses who mostly shoot at you with lasers which you have to dodge<br/></li><li> Nobody is going to play this<br/></li><li> Play secret level which remix older chapters to make them more challenging<br/></li><li> I just want to be done with this game<br/></li><li> Discover a mysterious dude who I haven't thought of a design for<br/></li><li> I'm a failure<br/></li><li> And many more!<br/></li><li> But not really, that's about it.
