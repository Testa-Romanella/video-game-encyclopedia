Eyes closed offers you a narrative driven horror experience with elements of exploration and experimental game mechanics set in a solitary Siberian environment of the early 50s. Protect your senses from A1, a terrifying, all-consuming anomaly, and uncover the dark secrets surrounding A1 and its discovery.</p>\n\r\nDevelopment:\r\n<p>The development took 3 weeks and was part of a collaborative prototyping by game artists and game programmers at the School of Games in cologne. The only requirement was to create a game using Unreal Engine (used 4.26). After the initial 3 weeks of development, some members worked on their own at irregular intervals for a few weeks to address and iterate on some aspects of the game. </p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\nProgramming :\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Lang\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mark Herdt\r\n\r\n3D Modelling:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Irfan Alici\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Johannes Trimpe\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Johannes Brinke\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eda Ayhan\r\n\r\nSculpting:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Johannes Trimpe\r\n\r\nAnimations:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Justin Ervens\r\n\r\nCompositing:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jonathan Lang\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Johannes Trimpe\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark Herdt\r\n\r\nGame Design, Level Design,\u00a0 Sound Design &amp; Story\r\nby Jonathan Lang\r\n\n\r\nSocial:\r\n<p>Jonathan Lang:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Linktree</p>\n<p>Johannes Trimpe:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Linktree</p>\n<p>Irfan Alici:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artstation</p>\n<p>Johannes Brinke:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Artstation</p>\n<p>Eda Ayhan\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Instagram</p>\n<p>Justin Ervens\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Instagram</p>\n<p>Mark Herdt\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GitHub</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13ceca20dfeb4dc65065f4bf3d4775c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 405, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Baracuda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
