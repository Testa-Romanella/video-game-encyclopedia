Pickup and use items with left click, then drop the utensil with right click when you're done with it.</p>\n<p>Use the Funnel to drop the batter onto the griddle. The perfect size is not too small or too big, should fill about 2/3 the plate.</p>\n\n<p>The Spatula is there to flip the pancakes. Be sure to get that golden brown on each side! Be sure not to forget about a pancake or it'll burn.</p>\n<p>Finally use the Tongs to grab your pancake and place it on the plate. Once you place 3 it's game over and I'll review how you did! So be careful to only use your best products. How close can you get to a perfect 100%?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T08:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a17c90f87e6227c93f7e3bc41121ca36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alec T"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
