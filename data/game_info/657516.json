Each cell interacts with its neighbours during each iteration\u00a0(each cell has 8 neighbours). Evolution follows the next rules:</p>\n<p>1- A live cell keeps alive in the next iteration\u00a0if it has between A and B neighbours. In other case, the cell dies.</p>\n<p>2- A dead cell gives birth \u00a0to a cell\u00a0in the next iteration\u00a0 if it has between C and D neighbours.</p>\n<p>Being A,B,C,D integers between 1 and 8.\u00a0These rules are abreviated as (A, B, C, D)</p>\n<p>The rules (2, 3, 3, 3) were proposed by Conway as it generates the more interesting structures.</p>\n<p>This game offers you the posibility of exploring Conway\u2019s Game Of Live in VR, in two ways:</p>\n<p>- Conway 2D, is the original Conway proposal, with personalizable rules, each iteration being placed in height layers.</p>\n<p>- Conway 3D, is the expansion of Conway 2D to the 3D space, using 23 neighbours for each cell.</p>\n<p>It is possible to personalice the rules (A, B, C, D) in the game (both 2D and 3D version), thus you are free to explore and discover new rules and interesting cellular structures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5cb87addc092aee64055e5811b2ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jmarco2000"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
