This little project is a labor of love by me and my good pal Austin. Our given theme was \"a strange dungeon,\" and we figured what could be stranger than peeking behind the curtain at who gets all those dungeons ready for heroes to crash through in the first place? In our game, you play as a goblin tasked with putting all of the coins back into the vases in between heroes' journeys through the dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Austin created the level designs and all of the art assets, and I duct taped it all together into a video game in Unity. It's not a perfect build, but we're happy that we finished in the two-week time limit nonetheless. If we come back to this project for additional polish, we'd like to add sounds, more puzzles, and perhaps some more dynamic effects like lighting. But for now, this'll do. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T09:45:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe673eddd6965dfed4d4a1a49b838d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zach!"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
