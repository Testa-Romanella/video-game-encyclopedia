The game derived from xiangqi (Chinese chess) and is very similar to it, including the starting position of the pieces, and the 9\u00d710 gameboard, but without the xiangqi \"river\" dividing the board horizontally at the middle.<br/><br/>Janggi is played on a board nine lines wide by ten lines long. The game is sometimes fast-paced due to the jumping cannons and the long-range elephants, but professional games most often last over 150 moves and so are typically slower than those of Western chess.<br/><br/>Sign in Google+ to enjoy online match via internet.<br/><br/>SUD Inc.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f843f0f62f74f5eaf497334b8964101e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["sud"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
