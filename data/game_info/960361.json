Hire unique players, manage your benchwarmers, discover synergies between them, choose new abilities, bribe the referees, visit the Blademaster for upgrades and a lot more.<h3>CRAFT YOUR TEAM</h3>Take charge of a ragtag group of hockey players in a roguelite journey across a mysterious land. As the newly appointed captain, every choice matters on your path to discover the secret of hockey's last bastion. Hire superstars, utilize the synergy found between players, and harness ruthless abilities, all in favor of crafting an unbeatable team.<h3>LOSING IS ONLY THE BEGINNING </h3>Easier said than done, as the ultimate dream team doesn\u2019t appear out of thin air. Use losses as an opportunity to visit the mighty Blademaster in between runs and permanently upgrade your hero for the battles ahead. When the Center is still flubbing every single face-off, there\u2019s no shame in lining the ref\u2019s pockets with some sweet \u201cmaple syrup.\u201d<br/><br/><h3>DEEP AND REWARDING GAMEPLAY</h3>Combining modern precision with fast-paced 90s-inspired action, Tape to Tape offers a unique experience in the form of a simcade  hockey experience. Bone-crushing body checks and stellar saves will keep players shaking in their skates, but mastering the dynamic puck physics system will secure the victory. Players and goalies will react to the puck bouncing off sticks and ricocheting off faces creating organic and emergent battles on the ice. Thankfully, there is no penalty when a tooth is lost.<h3>4-PLAYER MULTIPLAYER!</h3>The Tape to Tape can be played online with a total of up to 4 players using Steam remote play or locally. The fast-paced gameplay and tight controls makes for memorable matchups. We also invite you to join our Discord server to play with the dev team or to find other player amongst our wonderful community. The Roguelite campaign is also playable cooperatively with some friends for a truly unique experience. <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-30T09:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8881b44e3c5311566ebf9d0e05ecb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Excellent Rectangle"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Null Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
