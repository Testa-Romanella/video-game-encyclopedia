A lot more than I had expected!</p><p>The students followed along live-coding, asking questions, laughing to themselves about their creations. <br/></p><p>The workshop was less than 2 hours long. After the workshop I spent a few hours working on the game, instead of sleeping, and uploaded it here. Hopefully it will show the students just how quickly they can make things and share them.<br/></p>\n<p>Hopefully some of them will consider using Pico-8 at the next UL Gamejam! Time will tell.</p>\n<p>Overall the workshop was a lot of fun and I'd love to do it again (and better!).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d532dc29b653075e7191ecaf273eea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Darren K"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
