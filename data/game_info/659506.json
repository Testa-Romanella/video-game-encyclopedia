You must be fast to react on time, disable or destroy them to survive as long as possible. Try to capture enemy triangles by intercepting them by shape's core. Each hit on shape's rim take you closer to loosing the game.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Move - Arrow keys<br/>Rotate left - Z<br/>Rotate right - C<br/>Shoot (ammo needed) - Space<br/>Pause / unpause - Esc<br/>Pick menu item - Left mouse button</p><p>Future: I am aware not everybody like Z &amp; C for rotation. There will be an option to choose other keys in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Know issues</strong></p>\n<p>The UI aspect of the game is currently limited to just a few buttons and pausing. No settings, difficulty levels etc. I plan to improve that aspect over time.<br/></p><p>I had one report of game fully not loading in Firefox, Ubuntu. It was working in Chrome on the same machine.</p><p>It is a bit too hard to capture enemies in some cases as 1o r 2 pixels on border can decide and it is hard to be that precise. It is planned to be improved in next release.</p><p>Not everybody like mouse cursor hiding and locking in-browser. Not yet decided about it, but I am aware of this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Plans for future and improvements</strong></p>\n<p>Many things are already planned some of which are covered in my youtube devlog videos and on my Discord (https://discord.gg/rZJJ3KFJZW).</p>\n<p>Any feedback is welcome. I will take it for consideration though cannot promise any specific changes or features at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>iOS &amp; Android versions</strong></p>\n<p>I made some experiments with iOS on iPhone and iPad. In general it worked on my devices (graphics, music, interactions), but I have to make touch based controls to it as well as handle builds, Apple app store and Google play store. I cannot confirm anything at the moment. The more feedback and people testing desktop versions the higher possibility for mobile versions in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d580793e1342718437f6bc184462e42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["hybridlizardgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
