The Mill\u2019s VFX team led by Joji Tsuruga created the game engine characters by using motion capture of live action talent. These characters are striking both in appearance and movement; choreographed to the music and animated to be accurate to the human form down to a single finger.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267367ecc1108f8c6132ef64e121c64a.jpg", "website": "http://www.themill.com/portfolio/3770/clark-%7C-hoova-vr-experience?q=Clark%20|%20Hoova%20VR%20Experience", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 105, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Mill"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["The Mill"], "esrb_rating": null}
