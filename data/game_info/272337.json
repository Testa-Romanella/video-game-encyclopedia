So, we have a message to all those better life livers we are responsible for:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe us anything. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p>But we are not done with our service to other game makers (and our anti-service to corporations <strong>that are not us</strong>)! Behold, our computer lab researchers have discovered an exciting yet dangerous game creation technique: the <strong>gamevertisement</strong>.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The rules for this contest do not forbid making games that advertise something. In the hands of some <em>inferior</em> companies, a video game could be used to advertise sugary drinks or shoes that have a swoosh on them. But we at Balloon Co. [gaming division] have decided to use our powers not for evil, but for awesome. Thus we have a gamevertisement to gamevertise our own\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Balloon Co. Reverse Exploitation Anti-contest JAM\r\n</strong> </p>\n<p>which treats game creators MUCH better than this game contest. However, our lawyers warned us we may get kicked out of this contest if we <em>\u201cpost external URLs in our game description.\u201d</em> So, to find out more about the game jam AND get the URL you need to enter, all you need to do is play \u201cYou Are Welcome.\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p>But wait, we hear the voices in our heads pretending to be some of you saying \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t play the game? How will I enter this amazing contest?\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p>We at Balloon Co. [gaming division] are dedicated to <strong>accessibility options</strong> for people who are unable to play our game. THUS, if you send a private message to us asking\u2026 BREAKING NEWS! WE\u2019VE JUST BEEN INFORMED BY AN INTERN THAT ITCHY E I E I O DOESN\u2019T ALLOW PRIVATE MESSAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   </p>\n<p>Ok, time for plan bees: If you are unable to play \u201cYou Are Welcome\u201d head over to our old game \u201cThe Protest Vote\u201d and comment there that you want to enter the game jam (you can find it via our profile). That contest is over, so we can\u2019t get in trouble for giving you the link there (assuming our lawyers didn\u2019t skip on law day training last week and instead did leg day... again...).\r\n  </p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for, us to stop writing? Oh, if you read this far, that is probably exactly what you are waiting for. In that case, enjoy \u201cYou Are Welcome.\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p><em><strong>You\u2019re welcome!\r\n</strong></em> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f0c5880ae7ec3f020f10037cc596b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balloon Co."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
