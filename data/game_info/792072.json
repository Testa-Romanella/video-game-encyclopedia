You must destroy the projectiles before they reach the buildings. If you loose your cannon or all 6 buildings, the game is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your cannon can withstand minor damage, and takes some time to auto-repair, during that time your targeting speed will be reduced. The buildings, on the other hand, cannot withstand any damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You gain points by destroying enemy projectiles and spaceships and extra points if you hit more than one enemy with a single shot! keep amassing those points and you'll earn bonus rebuilds that will replace lost buildings at the beggining of the next wave. Reach a certain wave and you'll start to earn twice as many points! how far will you go?</p>\n\n<p>Vintage television vector created by macrovector - www.freepik.com</p>\n\n<ul><li>A beautifull city to protect\u00a0with night and day cycle and a color changing background.</li><li>2 types of enemy projectiles that falls from the sky\u00a0with distinct behaviour,\u00a0 damage and progressive difficulty.</li><li>3 types of alien spaceships that can be destroyed for points and other benefits, each with it's own characteristics such as speed, movement pattern and hitpoints.</li><li>Dramatic sci-fi music and retro sound effects that will transport you back to the eighties!<br/>\n</li><li>Multiple profiles suport.
