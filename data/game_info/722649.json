Okay, well then how about we make the art style absolutely terrible and up the difficulty by about 22. Still no? Well, you might be out of luck.<br/><br/>The very extraordinary adventure includes:<br/><br/>- Alternative difficulty game modes<br/><br/>- Extra end-game content<br/><br/>- Crabs???<br/><br/>- And more to come, I guess.<br/><br/>Be prepared to be frustrated unless you are an epic gamer, as after countless tests from only an elite selection of gamers (my parents) have tried and failed to complete the game without complaints about difficulty. So if you think you are up to the task, heed this message and prepare for the worst. Unless you have at least a couple of minutes of experience with video games, which in that case you should be fine.<br/><br/>BOK is a 2D Indie-Platformer made over the span of about a year by a 13-year-old kid with no experience of coding and learned it along the way. So while that feat. may seem impressive, it may prove to not be after install, mainly proven by the minimalistic and simplistic art style. However, the cartoony feel should make it a more laid-back experience that many can enjoy, as long as you disregard any rage you feel along the way.
