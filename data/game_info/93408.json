AND A FRIEND'S!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nChances are that you have played a card memory game many times... but have you ever done it this way?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MeMO</strong> is a card memory game whose peculiarity is that it allows two players to play it simultaneously - that is, they can flip cards at the same time and battle for the best score!<br/>\r\nAlso, it does not drive players mad due to bad luck, as unlucky moves are ignored - and, well, to say it all, lucky moves aren't rewarded either.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWith its neat graphics, which pay a little tribute to the <strong>Amiga</strong> and some of its games, and cool music, <strong>MeMO</strong> will take you for a pleasant trip down the memory (heh!) lane.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>classic <strong>Amiga</strong> computer\r\n</li><li><strong>68020</strong> CPU\r\n</li><li><strong>ECS</strong> chipset\r\n</li><li><strong>PAL</strong> video out and display\r\n</li><li>~730 kB of CHIP RAM\r\n</li><li>~30 kB of other RAM\r\n</li><li>~700 kB of disk space\r\n</li><li><strong>AmigaOS</strong> 2.04\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7d/c7d5e27654099f2fc20ba3adaa7c37ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
