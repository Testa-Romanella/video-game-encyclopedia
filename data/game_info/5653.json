The action starts from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12.<br />\nAn electromagnetic surge from the island hits an American satellite, and the unit goes there to investigate the place. Another surge damages the crew\u2019s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past. At this point, the plot twists; every event in the past has an impact on the present. Back in 1955, Nathaniel meets Nikolai Demichev, a Soviet scientist working at Katorga-12. Further on, Renko and Demichev run against each other during the whole story; their interactions are at the core of the game. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Singularity is the first-person shooter; the player performs the protagonist&#39;s actions.

At some point the player has to make choices; they affect the game result. The game also has multiplayer modes; the player can perform either as a soldier or as a creature, one of the individuals inhabiting Katorga-12. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game\u2019s concept is based on the Cold War era.
