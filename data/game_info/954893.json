This can stack until a parry does not occur</li><li>~~~~</li><li>A coin flip determines who leads when a battle starts\r\n  </li><li>The loser of a trick, will start the next turn\r\n  </li><li>After a parry, a coin flip determines who leads next</li><li>~~~~</li><li>During The Eclipse, the Moon and Sun will alternate\r\n  </li><li>Under a Sun, the <strong>HIGHEST </strong>card will win the trick\r\n  </li><li>Under a Moon the <strong>LOWEST </strong>card will win the trick\r\n  </li><li>Cards with Moon or Sun symbols will\u00a0 change the win condition during battle</li><li>\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d670def8a6b8a1b68e585f44e47d1c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["curlyGoblin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
