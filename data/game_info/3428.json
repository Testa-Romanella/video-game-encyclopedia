The celebrity runs, dashes, and hides while the paparazzi tries to take constant photos of them. It's a simple yet competitive arcade-action game with a Where's Waldo feel. It's a test of focus and reflexes and a silly take on celebrity culture.<br/><br/>Each match is a tug-of-war battle between a celebrity (battling for dignity) and a paparazzo (battling for money). When the paparazzo player takes a picture of the celebrity, the paparazzo gains money while the celebrity loses dignity. If the celebrity collects an adoring fan, they regain a chunk of their dignity. At the end of each round, when the celebrity reaches the limo, the winner is the player that has more dignity or money!<br/><br/>Matches can be played multiplayer, with one celebrity player and one paparazzo, or single player as celebrity vs. a paparazzo AI. <br/><br/>NOTE: This game was intended to played with your friends! We've got a single player mode for you to hone your celebrity skills, but the intent of the game is to bring friends together in fun competition!<br/>The game also supports Xbox 360 controller, which is the preferred way to play celebrity!<br/><br/>The game contains:<br/><ul><li>Six unique levels<br/></li><li>Seven silly characters<br/></li><li>Four celebrity powerups<br/></li><li>A big handful of dumb jokes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03bc8b50d87411e9ef186e9972fdef05.jpg", "website": "http://www.pringodingo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 17, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pringo Dingo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pringo Dingo Games", "Pringo Dingo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
