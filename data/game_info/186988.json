Push forward as the world around you becomes more interesting and new! Carve your future towards eternity!</p>\n\n\n<p>Author's notes (for whomever it may concern): First of all, huge thanks to my sister who was kind enough to compose the short song used here. Second of all, I apologize if this doesn't seem like much. I only joined in the middle of the jam, then spent way to long working on sprites that are hardly noticeable in the final game, plus grappling with systems I didn't have much experience with. Honestly, if anyone thinks this concept is worth pursuing, I'll happily work to add more substance to it. Let's hope the upload finishes before the deadline. Thank you for this opportunity and your time. Also, please let me know how it runs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleFieryOne"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
