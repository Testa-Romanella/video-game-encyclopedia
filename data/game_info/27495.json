Each layer can independently \n      be utilized to create the next masterpiece.\n    </p><p>\n      By combining the artistic modes, the numerous filters, the shaders, and \n      the tools, possibilities of what the stylus can paint onto the canvas \n      are endless. Oops, a mistake... 10 levels of Undo will help with that! \n      The artwork needs fine precision? Just zoom the canvas!\n    </p><p>\n      A large color palette, with dragging support, lets artists easily choose \n      exactly the color desired, and a Dropper tool makes identifying previous \n      colors a simple task.\n    </p><p>\n      The features don't just end with painting, either! How does the artwork \n      look on a wall? Explore the retro 3D Galleries to see all 18 paintings \n      framed on the walls. Is the artwork ready show off? Jump into the \n      Sharing area and prepare it for either 2D or anaglyph 3D (special \n      glasses required) posting to Miiverse\u2122.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a488612ff25cba6609c4e36dbed50e8e.jpg", "website": "http://sdkpaint.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
