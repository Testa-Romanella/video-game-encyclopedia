{"id": 58043, "slug": "jetpac", "name": "Jetpac", "name_original": "Jetpac", "description": "<p>Jetpac is a 1983 shooter video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game and released for the ZX Spectrum and VIC-20. It was also released for BBC Micro in 1984. The game is the first instalment in the Jetman series, and is the first game to be released by the company, who were later known as Rare. The game follows Jetman as he must rebuild his rocket in order to explore different planets, whilst simultaneously defending himself from aliens. Jetpac has since been included in other Rare games such as an unlockable in Donkey Kong 64 and part of the compilation Rare Replay. The game later spawned two sequels and a 2007 remake, Jetpac Refuelled, which was released for the Xbox Live Arcade service. The game was included in a games compilation on the ZX Spectrum Vega released in 2015.</p>\n<p>The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. Jetpac was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing \"instantaneous\" loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading took minutes. The game was met with critical acclaim upon release, with reviewers praising the game's presentation and playability. It later won the \"Game of the Year\" title at the Golden Joystick Awards in 1983.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac9/ac9f92f1c740cc218b3de974f0692b28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Tim and Chris Stamper"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
