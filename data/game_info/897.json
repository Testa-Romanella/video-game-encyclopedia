Accidentally she releases the evil and needs to fix the consequences of her actions. Between these sessions, a smoking character suggests you think over the events and your experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nSword &amp; Sworcery features various puzzles you need to solve during the exploration of the world. As a rule, they are somehow connected with music or sounds, so it&#39;s better not to play the game in noisy places. Even rare fights with monsters in the game are similar to dances: you need to feel the rhythm of the battle, and attack, defend and dodge predicting the actions of your enemy. The game is soaked with different philosophical ideas, that together with the gameplay, visuals and sound design create something closer to artwork in its core than a classic video game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T02:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db5ab0d41a2a57274902d32ea8e6f1ec.jpg", "website": "http://www.swordandsworcery.com", "rating": 3.49, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 212, "owned": 2307, "beaten": 123, "toplay": 53, "dropped": 139, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 266, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 268, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Android", "iOS", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Noodlecake Studios", "Capybara Games", "Superbrothers", "Jim Guthrie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Capybara Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
