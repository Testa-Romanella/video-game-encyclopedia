It may help.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Rabbit and The Owl</em></strong> is a cooperative puzzle-platformer where you (or you and a friend) journey through a fractured yet beautiful and hand-painted negative space landscape. The titular characters are confined to the realms of light and dark and are only able to progress through constant cooperation. Each puzzle requires you to explore and understand how you can best manipulate the environment and utilize the characters' special abilities to reach their respective goals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is set in the ancient world of <strong>Yril</strong>, a once vibrant land now a faded shell of its former self. At an uncertain point in time, two kindred spirits have manifested themselves as the Rabbit and the Owl. You will guide them through tranquil forests, harsh deserts, crumbling cities, and more while seeing echoes of the past toward a fateful encounter in the depths of <strong>Mount Rulnar</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c800c2a53b9c3ce5888a299a74250bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["formalsheep"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
