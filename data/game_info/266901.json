This power allows him to move without being seen, move through walls, cushion falls or pass through obstacles.</p>\n<p>Set in a <strong>futuristic</strong>\u00a0and <strong>cyberpunk </strong>world where <strong>A</strong><strong>tlas</strong>, a powerful megacorporation that has managed to provide energy to the whole galaxy despite the overpopulation, has hired you to do one job: infiltrate in one of their power plants to put it in maximum performance. You will have to use your powers to avoid or eliminate the enemies and accomplish it. You choose your path.</p>\n<p>This game is born as a mix between references of many stealth games like<strong>\u00a0Metal Gear Solid</strong>, <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>, <strong>Styx </strong>or<strong> Thief</strong>\u00a0(among many others) and <strong>Splatoon\u00a0</strong>for the shadow-merging mechanics.</p>\n<p>Atlas' Fate: Between Light &amp; Darkness is created as a \"portfolio\". It is developped by <strong>7 students</strong>\u00a0and made in a <strong>custom engine</strong> programmed from scratch.
