With no memory of what\u2019s happened and 25 days before he can return to civilisation, Archer will have to scrap, repair and upgrade every part of the ship in order to survive.\r\n  </p>\n<p>SS Theseus is a sci-fi survival game inspired by series such as <em>Star Trek </em>and <em>Lost in Space (2018) </em>and films like <em>The Martian </em>and <em>Cast Away</em>, with a scrapping mechanic that focuses on weakening certain parts of your ship in order to strengthen others. You will also need to operate the <em>Theseus\u2019 </em>systems to protect her from environmental disasters such as ion storms and meteoroid showers.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>SS Theseus </em>was developed by BlueDune Studio. We are a small development studio of 5 games design students working under publisher Octopus 8 Studios to make a serious game. As such, <em>SS Theseus </em>explores the issue of isolation, and the effects it can have on a person. <br/></p>\n<p>Developed by BlueDune Studio</p>\n<ul><li>Designers - Lorenzo Bonetti, Bartlomiej Marek</li><li>Programmer - Michael Luis</li><li>Artist - Gonzalo Quintanero</li><li>Sound designer - Fabrizio Riso</li><li>Producer - Santiago Towner</li></ul>\n\n<p>Published by Octopus 8 Studios</p>\n<ul><li>Studio and Marketing Manager - Ellis Devereux</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:36:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffbea3066247527437efcd165ffb1acd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octopus 8 Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
