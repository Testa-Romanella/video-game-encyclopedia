Each of the rooms of the dungeon is divided into 4 layers. All of those layers can contain Objects, Obstacles, or even the level goal. You can always see the currently active layers by looking at the torches at the top.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A door affects the visually shown layers always in the same way.\u00a0<br/>If you go through a door and it turns off Layer 3, it will do the same the next time you pass it in the same direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's your goal to develop an understanding of the effects each door will take on different rooms in order to find your way out of the dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>On your journey you'll find 5 items, that will help you:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RESETTER</strong> - Resets the entire current level for you\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>COBBLEBLOBBER </strong>- Lets you move stones and destroy them when pushed into a wall</p>\n<p><strong>LAYERGOGGLES </strong>- When put on you will see Layer 4, when put off you will unsee Layer 4</p>\n<p><strong>SAFEPOD </strong>- When placed inside a room, this room will not be changed by doors</p>\n<p><strong>BORDERCOAT </strong>- You can walk through a wall and reenter on the opposite side. Going through the right wall will have you reappear on the left side.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself stuck in a Level and want to proceed, you can unlock all levels with a button under Options &gt; \"Unlock all levels\".</p>\n\r\nHow does the game fit the theme?\r\n<p>In Alice DiMansion the feeling of unreality is displayed through dungeon rooms changing. Each time Alice passes a door, the next room changes, but never reveals its real appearance</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Alice DiMansion has its origin in the Brackeys Game Jam 2022. Its core theme is \"it's not real\".\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGame Design\r\n<p>Maximilian Putz</p>\n\r\nProject Management\r\n<p>Stefan Neubauer</p>\n\r\nTech Department\r\n<p>Richard Schubert<br/>Erik Hasenknopf<br/>Carl Hunger<br/></p>\n\r\nArt Department\r\n<p>Ronja Schneider<br/>Anja Schmidt</p>\n\r\nSound Design\r\n<p>Leonard Bernd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T16:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01ccf6f5d1f61eb71b579f77f636625e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kuay", "hasenknopf", "MarchTales", "Lyred", "Glitzerpixel", "LeBernd", "VirtusVT", "Crobon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
