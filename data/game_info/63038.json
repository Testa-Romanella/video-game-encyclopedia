Their yearly restaurant games are on now.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cAll that village life isn\u2019t for us, Bob! Especially since we\u2019ve been planning a tour around Asia for ages.<br/>\r\n Just imagine it, we\u2019ll see the Great Wall! It\u2019s an entire stronghold built to protect against tribal raids!\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cKaty, the last tribe that saw those walls was long before we were born. HG, the Emperor of China had all the insights into how to stop the raids and protect his kingdom, and also his settlers.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so dull, Bob! Then let\u2019s go to Singapore! They say it\u2019s the best town to live in, and also handy. We\u2019ll have a cookout on the beach.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d want to drink coffee, as in Roma, you remember? Best coffee I ever had! Are there coffee shops in Singapore?\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know, Bob. Our realtor lives there, we should get in touch and find out! I remember he had some kind of cooking craze.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cI always thought he paints figurines. Once I saw him painting a family of gnomes. Or were they brownies?\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cThey were orcs, Bob! An orc and his tribe. They wrote about those figurines in the Evening Chronicle. His orc took first place in a miniatures competition, and he won a Traeger grill.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great grill! Did I imagine it, Katie, or was that the doorbell?\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cIt must be the postman!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt really was the postman, with a letter from their friends on the island. Our heroes have been invited to open a cafe in the local safari park. Not wanting to miss such an exciting chance, the whole happy family set off on a journey to open a new business.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe island adventures continue!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrace yourself for colorful locations, exciting levels, fun characters, bonus tasks on every level, an upgradable team, all types of trophies, simple gameplay for any age, pleasant music and a captivating plot.
