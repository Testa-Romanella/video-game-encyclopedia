It's a simple game derived from Unity's Roll-a-ball tutorial. I opted for more 3rd party assets from Unity's asset store so I can focus more on the game mechanism as well as development. In total the build time was around 5 days/evenings (aligned with the summer My First Game Jam event).</p><p>I have a lot of god-kids and figure this is a great way to \"make\" things for them... Educational fun things ;) As such its <strong>FREE (Just enter $0!)</strong>.
