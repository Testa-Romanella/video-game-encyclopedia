I didn't read much of the page when i submitted my project. I didn't realise the Audio thing and used the song press start which I don't own. Everything past this sentence I\u00a0wrote before I submitted the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam project. It's lower quality than some of my other games, so I don't have the highest hopes. In this game dice fall down from the screen, and when they land, shoot bullets based off what number they land on. The dice at the bottom shoot lasers and come up timed to the music after you get to the drop. Song is press start.
