But obviously you cannot!! We give you a chance to unlock various locks with different combinations. You need to match up the line with the silver ball on the screen to move on to the next level by tapping on the silver ball. To begin, you will only have to do this once. The number of levers of the lock increases with the increase of levels of the game. You start with easy locks and continue trying to unlock hard locks so that you get closer to your record. More Safes you crack, the more points you earn. <br/><br/>Making a mistake in the game means you have to start all over again from the beginning of that level. This game is all about attention and patience. Give it a try as it a very addictive game and is available free of cost. <br/><br/>GAME FEATURES:<br/><br/>\u201cDoor like resemblance\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMultilevel Game\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cTouch and Tap Concept\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7b7f6f180c17d057f00a604a282bb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Serge Spijkstra"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Serge Spijkstra"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
