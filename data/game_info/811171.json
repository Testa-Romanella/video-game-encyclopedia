{"id": 811171, "slug": "five-nights-in-asriels-cupboard", "name": "Five Nights in Asriel's Cupboard", "name_original": "Five Nights in Asriel's Cupboard", "description": "<p>This game has nothing to do with Undertale, I just threw a bunch of random fictional characters into a FNaF fangame I made.</p>\n<p>This was originally made in scratch, so here's the scratch link in case this version doesn't work:\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/646852222\u00a0and here's the turbowarp link in case that one's laggy:\u00a0https://turbowarp.org/646852222</p>\n<p>Sorry for the 5-month wait, this game took longer to make than I expected. Also, jumpscares can now be switched off!<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>The gameplay mechanics are a lot like FNaF, so keep that in mind.</p>\n<p>Everything is controlled by clicking things and hovering the mouse pointer over things.</p>\n<p>-Use the cameras to look around the building.</p>\n<p>-Drag the slider across the screen to look around on the cameras</p>\n<p>-Use the BLUE buttons next to the doors to turn the lights on &amp; off (unlike the demo, you toggle the lights, not hold them)</p>\n<p>-Use the RED buttons next to the doors to open &amp; close the doors (these buttons also toggle)</p>\n<p>-Turn the desk fan on &amp; off by clicking it, which can help for noise reduction and reduce power usage. Be warned though that if the fan is off for too long the heat will rise.</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<p>-Charlie is the only animatronic that moves on the first night, and he only goes to the left door, not the right.</p>\n<p>-Garfield starts moving on night 2 and goes to the left and right doors, unlike Charlie</p>\n<p>-Asriel starts moving on night 3 and has the same code as Charlie.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Credits to Scott Cawthon (creator of FNaF) for inspiration and some of the sound effects.</p>\n<p>-JXVI (me): Story, code, lore, and art</p>\n<p>Asriel3333 (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/asriel3333/): Animatronic concept art, lore, beta testing, and inspiration for title and characters</p>\n<p>DumbArtist (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/DumbArtist/): Warning screen, title screen, easter eggs, vector animatronic models</p>\n<p>Opoids_ (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Opoids_/): Debugging, easter eggs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:36:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d8d0227c2ab788c34add0cff5451f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["-JXVI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
