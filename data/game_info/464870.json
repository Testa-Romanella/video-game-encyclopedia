Instead, you move around the box that contains the player and also allows you to see behind the level \"shroud\".\u00a0 Using the arrow keys or WASD, move the box around trying to find the enemies and slam the player into them to defeat them. Be careful! If you don't hit them fast enough they will hurt you instead!</p><p><strong>Credit:</strong></p><p>Programming: Imran Bharadia, Marquis McCann</p><p>Art: Tyriese Miller</p><p>Music: MoFi<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd265ea017a8c8afc2ea9d576c52e99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImranB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
