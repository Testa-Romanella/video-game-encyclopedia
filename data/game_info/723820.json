As a poor game designer the ingenuity of many of the entries, particularly given the restriction of the themes and the time allowed (48 or 72 hours)\u00a0is sickening!\u00a0</p>\n<p>However this casual game by\u00a0Sam Demaine\u00a0caught my eye as something that would be simple to do on the C64 and also I think has\u00a0the 'one more game' factor.</p>\n<p>I have added a few power-ups to vary the gameplay slightly but other than that it follows the original design.\u00a0The game is playable on a real C64 or emulator, or you can play in the browser on this page.\u00a0Feel free to post your best scores in the comments!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Collect as many yellow tokens as possible\u00a0while steering left and right to avoid the ever-increasing number of coloured enemy planes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enemy planes follow the same path as you, with the exception that unlike you they cannot wrap around from one side of the screen to the other and will instead turn around.</p>\n<p>This means you can try different strategies to manipulate enemy movements or simply rely on quick reflexes to steer clear of trouble.</p>\n<p>\u00a0---------------------------------</p>\r\nPower-ups\r\n<p>Collecting one of these will cause the following effects, listed from most common to least common,\u00a0for 8 seconds.
