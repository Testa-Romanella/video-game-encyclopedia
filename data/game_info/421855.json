Help Dan save his wife! Also, keep an eye on your bullets, and make sure they don't run out..</p>\n<p>Controls: Use X to shoot, and the arrows to move. If an imminent bullet is detected, and your health is low, the game will give you the option to dodge the bullet if you have enough luck, by pressing A.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All programming &amp; art by: olafher<br/>Font: m5x7 by managore<br/>Keys: Gerald's Keys by Gerald Burke</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Yes I did reupload stuff at 19:05 because I went to have dinner only to come back to discover a breaking bug in the respawn code after you die, so I fixed that. That's it, not anything else. I hope I don't get disqualified for doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This is a prototype, just to show off my idea for this game in combination with the pixel art and the luck system. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A BOSS YET, and lacks animations. After a \"somewhat like a boss\" the game ends for now, but I will probably finish the game later in my own time without a 6-day deadline. For now I am happy with how this turned out, and I hope you think so too!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T02:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4e421609afd549defbea9e7c465af34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olafher"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
