It won\u2019t be easy either way.<br/></li><li>You are trapped in a labyrinth: more than 100 hand-designed levels full of tension, action and mystery separate you from the exit.<br/></li><li>The rope is the only weapon at your disposal.<br/></li><li>Battle dozens of unpredictable enemies, learn their moves and plan yours. No tactics means death.<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles: carefully observe and exploit the many mechanisms.<br/></li><li>Discover a world packed with symbols to decipher and bizarre inhabitants.<br/></li><li>Defeat 4 minibosses and 5 bosses on the path to triumph.<br/></li><li>Climb the global chart but beware: every action has consequences.<br/></li><li>The game continues beyond the screen: communication and complicity are paramount.<br/></li><li>At least 10 hours of gameplay. Or 100 if you are not up to the challenge.<br/></li><li>A true hardcore experience: only a few will succeed.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T20:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7a2868f795d3edfb0b8f7eb20963e67.jpg", "website": "http://www.fromyonder.net", "rating": 4.5, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 41, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Yonder"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieGala"], "esrb_rating": null}
