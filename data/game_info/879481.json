Any number\u00a0of players beyond that will be able to connect, but will not contribute positively to the gameplay experience, as most of the mechanics(including the score system and the crime-solving system) in the game only take in parameters from\u00a0the first four players(Sherlock, Civilian 1, 2, and\u00a03).</p>\n<p>As <strong>Sherlock</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>during the <strong>first half </strong>of the game, you\u00a0are forced to be\u00a0<strong>locked </strong>in an enclosed room. why? because contemplating is good. or at least a friend of lingming said so.</li><li>during the <strong>second half </strong>of the game, you will be teleported from your little pathetic cage to the big house with <strong>traces of crimes committed by\u00a0the civilians</strong> during the first half of the game left <strong>for you to investigate</strong>.</li><li>depending on how well you do on the investigation, you'll get awarded more, less, or no points. when you do <strong>get awarded points for solving a case with accuracy</strong>, you also <strong>deduct the same amount</strong> of points that you gain <strong>from the player who committed the crime</strong>\u00a0that you just finished investigating.</li></ul>\n<p>As <strong>Civilians</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>during the\u00a0<strong>first half </strong>of the game, you\u00a0have the freedom to <strong>move around </strong>in the big house and\u00a0<strong>commit crimes </strong>against different things. depending on the types of crimes that you commit, you'll <strong>get awarded</strong> more or less points.\u00a0</li><li>during the <strong>second half</strong> of the game, you will be <strong>teleported into the enclosed room</strong> that Sherlock has previously stayed in <strong>until the end of the game</strong>. why? because you're done! you've probably committed a crime, and you need to contemplate. but why the same room? ummm, because it's already there :)</li></ul>\n<p>The junction between the first and second half of the game will be determined by a timing system(which is not in the game).\u00a0</p>\n<p>An example of how the game can be played at this point:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Things I've\u00a0Not Added:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>timing system and teleportation of the players</li><li>music and sound effects</li><li>character models, maybe(since players can already be differentiated by colors and a HUD bar with their names on it)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>alt-tabbing during crime investigation and clicking back onto the screen causes the cursor to disappear. i should add an input option to manually make the cursor re-appear in that case.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T15:31:40", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lingming kid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
