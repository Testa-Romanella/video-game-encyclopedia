Find your way through tiles of different shapes and colors. You can only move on tiles that share at least one of those two properties with you. Once you move to a new tile, you morph into the color and shape of it.</p>\r\nGet challenged!\r\n<p>The 60+ levels teach you the basic mechanics and test your abilities. Prepare to use keys, ghosts, and teleport tiles, too.</p>\n<p>In Endless you'll get a random board each time. You have to plan every move to prevent getting blocked while trying to get a new high score.</p>\r\nAccessibility options\r\n<p>Shapegrid is a game that relies on combining shapes and colors and this could be challenging for color-blind people. This is why you can choose four different themes in the settings menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/8489bb7f9d2ecd1989d5698a61a0a7f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matiasbontempo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
