The story starts off by reading diaries left in an abandoned house by a lady named Evie. As a player, you will soon realize that great tragedies hit her life and uncontrollably fell into a downward spiral of despair.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was a 3 months project made by Yasuka Taira (me) and Kensuke Hayashi (HS student and a student of mine.)<br/>\r\nKensuke helped me write the story (diaries and documents.)<br/>\r\nI did all the visuals and designing.<br/>\r\nShoutout to everyone who's helped us :D<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDue to my work and Kensuke's school, we were only working on it for 3 hours a day. Some days we just wanted to take a rest :P<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, we didn't have a programmer so the game might not be perfect, but we believe we did our best to make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHope you enjoy it :D", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c1440c22640abd191b589c033f1c921a.jpg", "website": "https://chillasart.artstation.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 24, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chilla's Art"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chilla's Art"], "esrb_rating": null}
