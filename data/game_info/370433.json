We are not yet sure if we will ever implement them. Sorry.<br/><br/>Q: Any other differences from the game I love for tenth of years?<br/>A: Yes, only a few. We have replaced libraries with tombs; you will always find money in tombs, and your hero will never die searching tombs. No diplomacy available, but we will implement it.
