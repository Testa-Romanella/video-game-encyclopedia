From basic melee swordsman and skilled ranged archers to massively destructive warmachines and tactically diverse magic units, you'll command more than 20+ Units, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and skills. You'll even be able to train and fight deadly beasts, many of them able to traverse the diverse terrain types that would otherwise impede other units, or even fly above them entirely, crossing great distances to strike at distant foes!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAttack the enemy with multiple Units for an added combat bonus, or perform a flank/rear attack for even more damage! With more advanced mechanics comes calculated Line-of-Sight targeting that gives Indirect ranged attacks advantage over Direct-Fire Units, and Unit Sighting distance allows you to move your troops out of range undetected from the enemy. Day/Night cycles mean an even greater ability to deceive your opponent, with visibility greatly reduced during the night for most Units, you'll be able to slip past their front and unleash a devastating surprise assault! If your Units witness too much friendly damage or death, their Morale will break and they can become Shaken or Panicked, or alternatively, can be Inspired or even Galvanized, fighting even more gallantly. If your Units fight and survive long enough, they'll advance in rank and gain increased Stats to become even more powerful.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs the long and rich single player story campaign progresses, you'll battle through a variety of tactically challenging and creative scenarios. Between each battle you'll get the chance to level up your Units, granting them Stat bonuses, or giving them new Abilities. You'll also research and develop unique Castle Powers, giving you the power to turn the tide in battle, along with bonuses for the different Battle Lords under your command.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDo you have what it takes to outwit and outmaneuver your opponent, to smash their forces to bloody pulps, and to demolish their once tall and proud Castle into rubble and dust?</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Note: This is a pre-alpha demo build.
