One player will play as the sheep who can drop bombs that blow up after a timer and the other player will play as the farmer who can chop off the sheep's head. The game employs an insta-kill mechanic to speed up the gameplay making it about tactical positioning and feinting (like fencing). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["koreus737"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
