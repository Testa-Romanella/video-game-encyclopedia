You play as a siren that is getting revenge for having her voice taken by superstitious sailors. (Sirens are basically just evil mermaids, right?)</p>\n<p>There are several mechanics that you can make use of in your rampage:</p>\n<ul><li>Left click lets you perform an area of effect\u00a0riff attack with your guitar</li><li>The area of effect can be increased\u00a0(greatly!) by collecting blue fish in the depths</li><li>Red fish heal you for 1 HP when collected</li><li>Left shift gives you a burst of speed that you can zoom around and vault out of the water with</li><li>Try doing tricks by taking out pirates while leaping out of the water or diving back down into it!</li></ul>\n<p>I didn't have time to really put a win condition into the game, but the fact that you get to play a sunglasses-wearing, leather-jacket-clad siren who's going on a musically vengeful rampage is enough of a win, I think.</p>\n<p>This was a challenging game to make, but I learned a lot while I was doing it! I finally learned the secret of keeping pixel games from looking all jittery! (It's the Interpolate option on Rigidbodies.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T10:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5e/e5eda9ff6657c78c8ead51e8bae00bf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["technitaur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
