On an icy tundra above an active volcano, the player must make a journey across it to safety while managing their body heat or freeze to death in the cold. However... the same heat that can warm your body is also prone to volcanic eruption. Do you stay long enough to warm your frigid bones and risk the imminent explosion? Or do you take your chances in the cold and hope to find shelter later? The decision will be yours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/01843fd4394de090133658786758b07d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CB Showtunes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
