We refer to the great Commando, whom we wanted to honor with this particular game on its 35th anniversary. You only have to see the title to understand it.\u00a0Naddando is a shooter in an aquatic environment, unlike our reference game Commando. And although it is inspired by it, it also has nods to other games like Rambo Part II or Ikari Warriors. But as we have said, they are only inspirations to achieve our particular development within the limitations of the used engine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ARGUMENT</strong></p>\n<p>You are an elite soldier with a mission, to rescue your fellow prisoners at the enemy base on the banks of the river. But reaching them will not be easy. We will have to swim for a whole day through the different channels of the river, bypassing the enemy troops and their controls. They will do everything possible to prevent us from rescuing our companions and emerging victorious.</p>\n<p>For this we have 3 lives, but if we are smart and get the extras that we will find along the way we can easily recover. On the other hand, if we rescue our companions, they will give us a good handful of points to give us that extra life, although we will not be able to free these until we reach the base (phase 3).</p>\n<p>However, not everything can be so easy. There are objects that instead of giving us points will take our life, the enemy has left us traps. Watch out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>PHASES</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 1: The canal\u00a0<br/>Phase 2: The river\u00a0<br/>Phase Bonus: Get your strength back\u00a0<br/>Phase 3: The base</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>:</p>\n<p>Development and programming: Commodore Spain<br/>Music title screen: Commodore Spain (Time to swim)<br/>Image title screen: Commodore Spain / Almighty God<br/>Load music: Narcisound (Naddando)<br/>Music credits: Narcisound (Shadows *) (Only in the .d64 version)<br/>Genre: Shooter<br/>Engine: Seuck</p>\n<p>* Shadows: Adapted version of the original Lindsey Stirling theme</p>\n<p><strong>MORE INFORMATION:</strong><br/></p><p>https://www.commodorespain.es/naddando-commodore-64-un-juego-de-accion/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ADITIONAL INFORMATION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As they say there are tastes for everyone.
