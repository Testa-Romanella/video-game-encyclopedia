There\u2019s always a war on in Crow\u2019s Foot. But that\u2019s not the only thing happening in Duskwall on any given evening. This city of ours is enormous, big enough to house all kinds of miscreants and scoundrels getting into much more amusing trouble than the Crows. Just because Mr. Harper didn\u2019t have enough space in his book for more than one such scenario doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go looking.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Underground Maps &amp; Passkeys</em>\u00a0is a collection of alternative starting situations for\u00a0<em>Blades in the Dark</em>, along with other odds and ends, written and compiled by members of the official\u00a0<em>Blades</em>\u00a0Discord community.
