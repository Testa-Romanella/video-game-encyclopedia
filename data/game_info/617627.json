Once an ability is assigned to a character, that ability is stuck with them until the end of the level.</p>\n<p>WASD and Arrow Keys move each character, respectively.<br/></p>\n<p>Get both characters to the stairs to beat the level.</p>\n<p>To give a character the ability to press buttons, drag the Rock Sock to one of their inventory slots.<br/></p>\n<p>To give a character the ability to push boxes, drag the shove glove to one\u00a0 of their inventory slots.</p><p>pressing escape opens a pause menu where you can reset the level if you get stuck.</p>\n<p>If things look weird, try switching to/from fullscreen. Sometimes the game seems look better with it on, and sometimes with it off. This only happens in Itch, for some reason.<br/></p>\n<p>Coding: UwertaDev and PlayToTroll<br/></p>\n<p>Art: MeMeDumDum</p>\n<p>Music: Ferkeshu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/439d18bebc525a623c7293f121854d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PlayToTroll", "UwertaDev", "MeMeDumDum"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
