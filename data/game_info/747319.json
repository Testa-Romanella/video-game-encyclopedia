Move your cursor to either side of the mirror to take control of the corresponding character, the other character will become your reflection.</p>\n<p>Pickup up the pipe weapon by walking over it, you will need this to attack enemies. Pipe weapons are independent of the side of the mirror you control.</p>\n<p>Left click to attack an enemy. Right click and hold to aim a throwing attack. Release right click to initiate the pipe throw attack. Attacking takes stamina, which is represented by the eyeballs in the bottom left of the screen.\u00a0Each time you swing you lose stamina, if you try to swing without any stamina you drop your pipe. Gain more stamina by collecting pills.</p>\n<p>If you are hit by an enemy, you drop your pipe. If you are hit by an enemy while not holding a pipe, you die and lose the game. Your score increases with each pill you collect during the game.\u00a0</p><p>Note: The current build contains a bug that allows you to walk through the walls and the mirror, this completely breaks the game as you can imagine. Try to stay in the play area if you want the intended experience. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42c6b251400a738ef6a4af5d73cdd5c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["robertindygames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
