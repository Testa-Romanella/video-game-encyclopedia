Being adverse to violence, and having no skill for it either, they will need to rely on the only thing they know how to do to defend themselves... Summoning rituals, that often end in failure.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAvoid the caves in habitants, summon creatures, flee the bad ones and race to the highest score you can, before succumbing to ineptitude, in a comical adventure of Ritual Failure.\r\n</p>How to Play<br/><p>\r\n\tTo play Ritual Failure you need to find summoning circles within the never ending cave. At each of the spiritual point of the circle a part must be summoned. Use the summon part button to trigger that part of the summoning ritual. Once all 4 parts have been summoned a creature from beyond will appear, but watch out it may not always be helpful.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs the game progress the cave inhabitants get significantly harder. Perform summons for points. Let your summons kill cave creatures for points.\r\n</p>\r\n\tControls\r\n<p>\r\n\tRitual failure is designed for play with up to 4 players using Xbox controllers for PC but player 1 can be played with keyboard and mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controller</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keyboard</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Move</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tLeft stick\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tw,a,s,d<br/>\r\n\t\t\t or arrow keys\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Run</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tLeft trigger\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tLeft Shift\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Summon part</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\ta,b,x,y\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t1,2,3,4\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Spawn</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tStart\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tReturn\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pause</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tBack\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tEscape\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\tCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tRobert Bryce - T: @braindance_au<br/>Matt Halse - T: @m_halse<br/>Tayla James - W: http://www.taylajames.com/<br/>Fred Mulholland - T: @big_triple_f<br/>Grae Saunders - T: @grae_saunders</p><p>\r\n\tMusic by Syntone http://syntone.com.au/<br/>Richard Gaynor<br/>Stefan Pugliese</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbdbcb4dd479613bb325a75d654268cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GraeSaunders"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
