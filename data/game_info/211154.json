In a race to find out just what is happening and why the sun is missing, you also must hide from <em>their\u00a0</em>lights. Will you persevere and find the answers you need or be subjected to the cruel nature of the unknown?</p>\n<p>This game was created during the Brackey's Game Jam. The theme is light so I decided to have light play a major part in the aesthetic of the game. The game at the moment is extremely short since I didn't have much time to expand upon the narrative events.
