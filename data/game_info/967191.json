Also, swing your arms and strike poses to boost your magic! We deliver a heart-pounding, thrilling real magic experience.<br/>\r\nThe game supports multiplayer for up to four players. It features 2v2 team battles as well as a battle royale mode where four players fight for survival. A solo play mode is also available.<br/>\r\nThe objective is to cast spells at your opponents to deplete their HP and defeat the enemy team. Chanting spells requires magical power (mana). The amount of mana consumed (MP) varies depending on the spell used, and mana can be replenished from randomly appearing orbs.<br/>\r\nCollect orbs to stack up mana for a barrage of smaller spells, or save up for a devastating ultimate spell. Players can also place blocks on the stage to create a battlefield that benefits them. The ways to battle are endless! Master magic and terrain to dominate the battlefield!<br/>\r\nAs an option, we also feature a new function called \"e-act Catcher.\" This comes as a DLC; from a separate downloadable PC version, you can join not as a participant in the battle, but as a video director capturing players in VR. If you operate this feature from your computer screen, you can record battles from various camera angles. Players in the battle can even change their avatars' expressions, allowing for video distribution that feels like a promotional video or even a movie. Experience the revolutionary e-act Catcher feature to make innovative broadcasts from various camera angles!<br/>\r\nFor more details about the PC version equipped with the e-act Catcher feature, please visit the official website.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T04:46:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7522091dfcee8c0dab2362fe022420aa.jpg", "website": "https://www.akpala-vr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedefineArts.Inc"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RedefineArts.Inc"], "esrb_rating": null}
