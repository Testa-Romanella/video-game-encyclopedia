I decided to give myself a couple of hours to recreate the classic brick breaker game, in the Godot engine. In just over four hours, well, I think I succeeded, heh heh heh.</p>\n<p>In case you've never played it before: You move a paddle back and forth across the screen to bounce a ball to break bricks. Your score goes up by one for every brick broken. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, you lose. When all the bricks are broken, new bricks will spawn, so you can keep playing forever :)</p>\n<p>As per the theme, the game was designed in under 64 x 64 resolution, and stretched to fit the screen.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4f/b4fb44472e17c37089ed0b8e6dc042bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DorkYface"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
