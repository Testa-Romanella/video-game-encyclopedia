That feeling when you defeat a powerful monster that just killed you 10 times is just amazing and I did my best to recreate it in 2D (remember Tigrex?).</p>\n<p><strong>Megaman and Demon's Crest from Capcom</strong></p>\n<p>Other 2 big inspirations for the 2D battles, specially Demon's Crest, which featured some unforgiving boss battles.</p>\n<p><strong>Shin Megami Tensei series from Atlus</strong></p>\n<p>While Daily Espada has very little in common with Atlus's RPG series, I love how Shin Megami Tensei uses creatures from all kinds of mythologies and how it often features Japanese culture. So I wanted to create a game that paid homage to my own country: Brazil. So the monsters are inspired by Brazilian culture and history, with my own spin put on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Kamen Rider from TV Asahi</strong></p>\n<p>The stylish Japanese tokusatsu fighter I loved as a kid and still enjoy, served as inspiration for the main character and some gameplay mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc194f7e4f7f8900683b7da1a8dcad07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pidroh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
