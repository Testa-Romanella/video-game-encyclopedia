{"id": 938387, "slug": "esc-escape-button", "name": "Esc - Escape Button", "name_original": "Esc - Escape Button", "description": "<p>-------ESCAPE BUTTON--------<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hello, and welcome to this experimental game.. if you can call it that.. This is my first time trying a new thing that hasn't been used as much, if at all, in an old RPGMaker program. The game consists of mostly parallax backgrounds, and a couple of tilesets. This took some time to make, it's not perfect and the story might be all over the place, but I wanted to try something new!! The game is a little short, so you could probably finish it in less than 20 minutes. I had lots of fun with this, so I hope you enjoy this short little game! Even if it's all over the place ababa. The game has 2 endings, so have fun there.<br/></p>\n\n<p>-------HOW TO PLAY--------\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Move the 'mouse' (Beefcake's finger) with arrow keys and interact with the Z button. When you move towards a certain object, not only will the object be highlighted, but Benny will be pointing right at it. Any item you collect will be highlighted with an image above as seen in the screenshots.</p>\n<p>Think of it like those good old escape-room type games where the inventory is placed above like so. By this, there is no access to the regular rpgmaker menu, but for this kinda game, I doubt you will need it.</p>\n\n<p>-------SYNOPSIS--------\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tired of the never-ending loop of acting as a soon-to-be dead protagonist in a horror game, Beefcake discovers an alternative route that allows him to break the cycle\u2026 Only to end up in an entirely different game, where his only objective\u2026 is to escape. You take the role of Beefcake, and his trusty partner Noah (the rabbit that sticks out of his hat), explore and interact with the environment in order to escape the room.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional information can be found in a word document, along with a walkthrough.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Everything (excluding the music and sfx have been done by me (Two-Crown Games)<br/>Music: <br/>Whole Tone Limbo \u2013 God mode <br/>Sam Seeger \u2013 Showa <br/>We wish you a Merry Christmas (music box version)</p>\n<p>Sound effects: Default rpgmaker sound effects, youtube, FilmCow designed SFX<br/></p>\n<p>If you wish to support me and my future works, feel free to buy me some coffee @ko-fi.com/alphabirb</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T10:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca3ebc751d80ff09a288b2d13b6a62d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Birb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
