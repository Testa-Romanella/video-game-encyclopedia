In all, there&#39;s a great degree of similarity between the two games. In addition, Rise of the Triad puts most of the other DOOM wannabes to shame - it&#39;s that good!&quot; -  Chuck Miller, Editor of interactive EntertainmentFeatures<br />\nRise of the Real Estate: Super huge levels - up to one million sq. feet, and up to 16 stories high!<br />\nDigital Diversity: Ten unique, digitized enemies in the game, plus four multi-stage bosses!<br />\nWin Your Way: Thirteen hardcore weapons and play as one of five characters, each with unique attributes and abilities.<br />\nCollateral Damage: Nearly every object can be destroyed - even mark walls with bullet holes!<br />\nConnect and Kill: Modem and network playable, up to 11 players via an IPX compatible network.<br />\nController Support: Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19e/19eb4045b8e6d8d7dc876afac8991b4d.jpg", "website": "https://3drealms.com/catalog/rise-triad-dark-war_44/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 385, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 14}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 33, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 33, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "Classic Macintosh", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["3D Realms", "Saffire", "Apogee Software", "Cygnus Software", "Saffire Association"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["3D Realms", "Apogee Software", "Apogee", "FormGen", "Mobila Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
