(Yay!). I'm a lot happier with the overall quality of this one a as well - it's got nicer quality pixel art, cleaner code, and less bugs, as well as actually having audio. Also, I'm surprised the music sounds as good as it does, with it being my first time using Bosca Ceiol for an actual project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/4633c4897a6cee08aee370619b790ffb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Davies"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
