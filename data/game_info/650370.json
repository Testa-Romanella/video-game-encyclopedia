As the player you will settle cities, improve your current ones and explore lands.\u00a0You will also get to read letters that explain this intresting story. As a tip remember to settle cities with good connections to your homeport since the speed of the trade routes affect the city maintenance.</p>\n<p>This game is my first project made with Godot. Previously i have only made games with Unity and Godot proved to be a excelent engine that frustarated me less than Unity.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ASSETS USED:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/861<br/></p>\n<p>https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/collection/1484/blue-marble</p>\n<p><strong>PROGRAMS USED:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Godot</p>\n<p>Blender</p>\n<p>Gimp</p>\n<p>piskelapp.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc03fadc1021d897416d1689538870ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tooppa"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
