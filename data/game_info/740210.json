To do this you  need to choose if the next letter in the word is the same as the current  one or if it is higher or lower in the alphabet than the currently  shown letter. \r\n  </p>\n<p>You have five lives per word which get reset when you complete the  word, with 4 different difficulties of words, there are more five letter  words than the others as I planned this to only use five letter words  but added the others for people who wanted to try harder words.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game only took me a day to create but I wanted to make it so I  had the code in case I want to build upon this game with extra features  or incorporate this style puzzle into another game I am making. Like the  picross game, this is not completed but part of a group of smaller  games I am creating to see how they are coded while I work on bigger  projects.\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you play and enjoy this, make sure to follow to try out other puzzle games that I make and upload.      </p>\n<p>Donations are not necessary to play this or any of my other games   currently, but if you do donate any money it will go into improving   equipment, making more games and improving current games.          Thank you for checking out my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9cbe13f76815602fc9de0d21fba8607.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fortstudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
