This cute take on the top-down shooter brings homespun style to decades-old gameplay.<br/><br/>&amp;quot;our fans&amp;quot;<br/>2 words - Buy it<br/><br/>********************************************<br/><br/>Do you like aircraft combat?  Love drawing your own game graphics?  Want a low-key, relaxed gaming experience?  Well then, you\u2019ve come to the right place.  A Doodle Flight is a wonderfully fun and refreshingly simple game that\u2019s guaranteed to make you giggle.  <br/><br/>The first thing you need to do is draw/import your plane.  That\u2019s right, you get to create what you\u2019ll fly in to swoop down and destroy your enemy.  Will you be the Red Baron?  Maybe a P-51 is more your style.  Most likely, your design will look a lot funnier than any plane you\u2019ve ever seen.  <br/><br/>This iPhone and iPod Touch app is a cute flight war game with hand drawings, which is why it is called, A Doodle Flight.  Every time you eliminate an enemy, bubbles pop out to indicate that you\u2019ve made a kill.  It\u2019s like fighting with a cartoon character.<br/><br/>To maneuver your aircraft, you have the option of using a tilt control, touch screen and tilt together, or just touch screen play.  <br/><br/>Although it sounds very easy, you\u2019ll find nine unique stages of challenge for you to complete with A Doodle Flight.  There are ways to add to your arsenal as you go, so if you play your cards right, you may pick up some extra bullets or missiles to help prolong your life.<br/><br/>In this new version, we introduce an OpenFeint community to replace our existing online scores system.
