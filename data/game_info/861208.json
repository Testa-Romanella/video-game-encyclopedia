{"id": 861208, "slug": "tales-of-saturn", "name": "Tales Of Saturn", "name_original": "Tales Of Saturn", "description": "## Alpha version available! check out ##\r\n\n\n<p>Where we are and who we are is a mystery in the narrative, but the biggest one is whether we will overcome the challenges to discover everything there is.\r\n</p>\n<p>Set in an ancient world where neither the place nor the time is known very well, there is a lot to explore and discover. We will have many challenges to achieve. Will we find everything we need?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Come find out what happens when we add Like soul difficulties in an exploration game with turn-based puzzles and battle.</strong>\n</p>\n\n\r\nNARRATIVE\r\n<p>The story will not only serve to tell a narrative, but also to unlock abilities and actions. There you will always have your story, if you can get obstacles and challenges where only finding out more about yours. This will happen as you explore the map and as you progress through the story, each step will have its importance.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n\n<p><strong>Tales of Saturn</strong> will have <strong>two game modes</strong>, the first is <strong>free mode</strong>, where you walk in third person around the map to explore, pick up items, make interactions with save points and solve puzzles. </p>\n<p>The second game mode is the <strong>battle mode</strong>, activated when you enter the battle area, which will normally be the field where you will be identified by the enemy, but this mode, as crucial as it is for your evolution in the game, is not mandatory, because the character can pass far to avoid battles. In this mode, there is a style of play per turn, the camera is fixed and is at an angle that allows you to see all the characters and enemies. To battle and move around, you'll have to use the mouse and interact with the action bar.</p>\n<p>Currently (with the game still in development) you only have the option to play with keyboard and mouse, having the following commands:</p>\n<p><strong>Free Mode </strong>(When not in battle)\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>W, S, A, D</em> = Walk in all directions;\r\n</li><li>Mouse Movement = Camera Rotation;\r\n</li><li>Mouse Scroll = Zoom in and Zoom out;\r\n</li><li>F = Interaction with items and other interaction points;\r\n</li><li>I = Inventory;\r\n</li><li>Esc = Options menu and Exit.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Battle Mode</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse Left Button = Bar action selection, target selection and movement location;\r\n</li><li>Mouse Right Button = In target selection mode, can return action selection;\r\n</li><li>Esc = Options menu and Exit.</li></ul>\n\r\nWORLDS\u00a0\r\nWINWOOD,\u00a0AM I WELCOME?\r\n\n<p><strong>Winwood</strong> is not just any land, since when we woke up there, we didn't seem to be welcome. There are many challenges and beings that will hinder your progress. Winwood will be the first land, in a tropical climate, with lots of trees and a beautiful waterfall. There will be several battle challenges and important items to progress scattered around the map. You can also find secret locations and unravel the narrative mystery.\r\n</p>\r\nNEW LANDS AND BIOMES?\r\n<p>As the story progresses, they will have to travel between other lands to discover more about their history. There will be different biomes and many challenges in the future. Will you be able to outrun them?\r\n</p>\r\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM\u00a0TALES OF SATURN?\r\n<p>Gameplay will be fun and challenging, with a moderate difficulty level. The idea is to have a battle mode, despite being dynamic, in which you will have to pay attention to the enemy's movements.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>New maps and many different challenges are planned for each one.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is out of the prototype phase and is being worked on to have a first version demonstrating the challenges and most of the mechanics. Currently we already have a playable version, but with many details to be fixed and with some of the main mechanics.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>We also have in the future an improvement in characters, monsters, effects, items and many other assets.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tales of Saturn\u00a0</strong>is an independent project created by a single person with the objective of executing his ideas taken from years of playing the most varied games, it was in this accumulation of knowledge that the idea of Tales of Saturn came about. With knowledge acquired over the years, after the completion and launch of this game as always dreamed of, the goal is to move on to many other projects already conceived, for this Castello Dreams was created, a brand with the objective of being able to develop more efficiently and a good team.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Created, Written, Directed and Developed by</strong> Thales Castello\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Arts, Animations and Music by </strong>Thales Castello and various assets acquired</p>\n\r\nDID YOU LIKE THE PROJET AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE?\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Follow the project here and on all social networks.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Write your feedback in the comments, on social media or via email.
