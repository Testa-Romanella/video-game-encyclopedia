This was another game derived from a minigame game found in The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy like Bubble Dizzy. The game was based on the game play from an arcade game titled Toobin'. The C64 version was developed first by Paul Black. The C64 version was originally a clone of Toobin called 'Toobin Turles'. When the game was taken to Codemasters for consideration, it was rebranded to take advantage of the Dizzy character.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Oliver Twins"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
