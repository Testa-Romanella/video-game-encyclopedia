We are releasing the final game jam build (Space Rex 48) as well as an updated polished version, so it's kind of like getting an early access.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe had more features that we wanted to add, but had to cut them to meet time constraints and allow for last minute polishing/fine tuning to make Space Rex even better at the end of the jam.\r\n</p>\r\nControls/Gameplay\r\n\r\n<p>It's an autorunner, so all you need to do is jump and stay alive while gaining points for distance traveled and enemies defeated.</p>\n<p>Press space to start.</p>\n<p>Once in the game, press space to jump, and hold it to jump higher.</p>\n<p>Holding space can also slow your fall.</p>\n<p>Jump on enemies for points, except for the stegosaurus because they're pointy.</p>\n<p>That's it.</p>\r\nDevelopment Team\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tIan Cantor - Programmer/Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMichael Springer - Programmer/Artist<br/>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Space Rex</strong></p>\n<p>Music produced for Space\u00a0Rex\u00a0by Felikitty!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Space Rex (48-hour Game Jam)</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tMusic via opengameart.org\u00a0by SketchyLogic\r\n</p>\r\nAwards\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n1st place in Looking For Group Pittsburgh (@lfgpgh) Game Jam - January 2017\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37dc1081dc8d0c90836f2d038a16d0dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Item Crate"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
