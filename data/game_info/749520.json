I do have wonderful friends that have helped do some testings on previous builds that were on Gamejolt. One major issue is DO NOT use a magical warp book in caves because for some reason they keep glitching and not removing the dark vail. I will get around to correcting issues as they are discovered. Also if you can't damage a creature for whatever reason, then if it's not a boss it be best to run away if possible and train more or get better equipment. I'm still new to this engine and I'm trying my best to make things work. I recently got some plugins to pretty up the game a bit but even still I'm not an expert. I just hope everyone will enjoy it for what it's worth.
