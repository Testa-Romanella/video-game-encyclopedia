You cannot attack diagonally.</li></ul>\n<p>This is game\u00a02 of 12 that I'm making this year (2018) as part of my 12 games a year game jam challenge. My best friend Michael Marney-Brusstar is joining me on this\u00a0challenge.</p>\n<p>Art, programming and level design by Michael Marney-Brusstar.<br/></p>\n<p>Music, sound design, technical direction, additional programming\u00a0and level design\u00a0by Aim Diab.</p>\n<p>If you like the game, I'd love to hear from you.
