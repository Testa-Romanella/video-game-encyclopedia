Secondly\u00a0 trying to convert my finished python game to an .exe file has been a bit of a disaster (before writing this I spent about 3 hours trying to figure it out) and ultimately I wasn't able to do it. This means that unless you have the python module installed you wont even be able to run this program(if you do have it installed you will have to run it in the Idle python app). Sorry for the inconvenience .</p><p>Now to the few people that are actually able to play it heres my game! In it you are a lackey for a Mafia boss and\u00a0he has a job for you, there's some people causing him trouble and if you don't stop them it could mean war. How might you stop them ?\u00a0By taking them out of the picture... Permanently!</p><p>Once again i'm really sorry that I wasn't able to correctly format this game, as a result I doubt anyone will actually be able to play it but thanks for taking the time to look at my project none the less.\u00a0 :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b448199f2b619cf3dc7a47b6948328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lukes Life"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
