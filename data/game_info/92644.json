Feel free to leave any comments on my entry page.</p><p>The game places you in command of a lone starship hiding in a nebula with 5 enemy ships. You have to find them using probes, which can scan over a short range. If the probe picks up emissions from an enemy ship it will mark the direction the emissions came from (it should only take 3-4 of these to triangulate the ship's position). If an enemy ship falls within the probes inner-radius it's exact position will be marked on the grid. Once you think you know where a ship is lurking you can destroy it with torpedoes.</p><p>I didn't get as far as I'd like with it. Enemy ships don't have AI and don't do an awful lot. The scanner is probably a little too precise, some sort of analogue waveform readout with more ambiguity might work better, I just didn't get a chance to try it. Torpedoes can be customised by allocating power between speed and yield, though admitedly this doesn't affect the game as much as I'd planned.</p><p>Code/Design: @DesignerBradley<br/>Ship Model/Music: @MattMakesThings</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p><p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> : Fire probe/torpedo<br/>Right Mouse Button : Rotate the view<br/>Middle Mouse Button : Move the view</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2d248c37c261284616dac363d2e23ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Urban Logic Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
