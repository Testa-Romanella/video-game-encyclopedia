At some point I thought about converting it to a Twine story but that seemed like a lot of work and I'm probably never going to come back to it and fix all the dead links.</p>\n<p>This was all like two years before Twine even existed, so it's all in HTML and it was a lot of work to do. Hopefully it displays fine in itch here.<br/></p>\n<p>It's pretty big and there are a ton of dead ends that were never written. So if you hit one, well, sorry.</p>\n<p>There used to be some drawings by my old friend Jessica (https://twitter.com/my2k), for this too but they have long been lost. C'est la vie.</p><p>The story map is to the right, look at this mess.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d08/d08540ee12465f9d2f82c6bf19210c72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["heyboots"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
