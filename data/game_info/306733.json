Distracting narrative and story and special effects\u00a0have been stripped in favor of making a game that is widely accessible to a broad range of players of all ages.\u00a0A clear path of progression enables players of every skill set to move forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Best of all, this game allows you to have as little, or as much, time investment as you like; at any given moment. This is a game you can pick up and play for five seconds or five hours.\u00a0A lot of work was put into making the controls intuitive and easy to master, even for someone new to gaming.</p>\n<p>Further more, the game is open ended; which means you can continually progress, but you'll never be disappointed by a poorly designed ending. You can play forever (or, at least until your body gives out).</p>\n<p>And of course, best of all; despite the endless hours put into creating and designing this experience, PlusOneSimulator is being offered to you absolutely free of charge, without any catches. You get the full game, no gimmicks, no ads, no microtransactions, and no DLCs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You get the complete PlusOneSimulator-- absolutely FREE.</p>\n<p>However, if you would like to throw a couple dollars this way to go toward other \"less polished\" indie titles being developed by LillyByte, that would never go a-stray!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T05:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d243e931ab42abc8f39dd829ca993c20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LillyByte"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
