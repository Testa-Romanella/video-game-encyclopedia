In \"Narrow Your Scope\", the player is presented with a number of cards each representing aspects of a game idea. Each card has a value, but that value is also its cost. The player must then choose between 3 and 6 cards to \"make a game\" from. Once they have picked out the most valuable parts, they hit a big red button and are judged based on a number of factors including the number of ideas included and combined cost of all features.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Exit Row Games</strong> Team<br/></p>\n<p>Peter Galbraith - Head of Stressing, Lead Programmer - @PeterJGalbraith<br/></p>\n<p>Nick Tiemeyer - 3D Artist/Red Car Survivor - @NickTiemeyer</p>\n<p>Ali Heston - Consistently Tired - @ali_heston<br/></p>\n<p>Nathan Ferguson - Programmer -\u00a0@ngmferguson<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e401d5dba13571b893db012e4feb25db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Peter Galbraith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
