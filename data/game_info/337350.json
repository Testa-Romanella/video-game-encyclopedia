(apologies if it sucks)</p>\n<p><strong>Devlog</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://gamejolt.com/games/indielife/416841</p>\n<p><strong>Current State</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Currently I have only implemented the core mechanics, get a job, make money, learn skills/topics, create games based on what you learned, and publish the game.</p>\n<p>The game is very simple at the moment with every action being followed by a fade to black screen. I plan on changing this with minigames For example, instead of interacting with the door to go to work and then fading to black and getting your money, you will actually have to go to the work place and do your tasks to complete the working day. and the same with the other mechanics such as making games and learning etc.</p>\n<p>I will release another version shortly with saving and loading implemented and I will also fix the bugs with the current build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af78c4bc35de460018b20d9777c4b40f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kekjek"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
