I know it's rough around the edges and a bit ugly in places, but it was a fun enough idea that I\u00a0figured it was worth releasing for 99p.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>- Guess the ratings of almost infinite\u00a0<em>real</em> reviews!<br/></p>\n<p>- Listen to a funny robot voice read out each and every one!</p>\n<p>- Go for a highscore over five rounds! If you get it bang on in the last round, you get an extra go, so there's no limit to how high your score can go!</p>\n<p>- Share the funniest reviews you find on social media\u00a0with an easy to use share button that instantly copies a screenshot to your clipboard!</p>\n<p>- If you're a\u00a0\u00a0streamer, you can even play against your chat in Chat V.S Streamer mode! Does your chat know reviews better than you?\u00a0(<strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>When entering your username the input IS case sensitive!)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT TO NOTE BEFORE PURCHASING:</strong>\u00a0This game searches online to find real reviews. If the places it searches change the way their websites work, the game may break. If this happens I will try my best to fix it, but if for some reason I can\u2019t I cannot offer refunds (hence me choosing to make the game very cheap!). If the hopefully unlikely chance of you losing your 99p on a broken game\u00a0bothers you, I completely understand and would recommend you do not purchase at this time. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5af/5affb066f4fb7213ad9c6bc524608d43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Mackinnon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
