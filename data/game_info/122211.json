Is there something in there between the shadows of the trees? Is that a fox?! It might just be a shadow, but better hide, you know just in case. However, hiding forever might not be that smart in retrospect. </p><p>Scared-Ass Squirrel is a 2D procedurally generated sidescroller game. Playing as a squirrel, you have to move through the dark forest, jumping around and hiding from the foxes, but do not hide too long, as the shadows will catch up to you.</p><p>Scared-Ass Squirrel is made for Nordic Game Jam 2017, with the theme \"not there\".</p><p>Controls:<br/>Spacebar - Jump<br/>Arrow keys - Run<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/></p><p>Camilla Just Overbye Carstensen</p><p>Kristian Torgard</p><p>Liva Stubbe Teglbj\u00e6rg</p><p>Merlin Gy\u00f6ry</p><p>Ola Lato</p><p>P\u00e5l Schakonat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53e1a73393ffa06b090368c90de15a2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aergia", "Cloudjump3r", "Zima", "overlyclose", "Lomasa", "Konfetti91"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
