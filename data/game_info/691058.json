You're only equipped with a double barrel shotgun, and a few flares. To get out of here, you must find a key to unlock the door. Using your limited resources, navigate the maze and make your way out. Be wary about where you shoot, though...<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Sparingly is a small game I made based on a concept I came up with on the fly. It was made in about two days total, and it's not perfect. I might add more to it one day.<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLSWASDMoveMouse<br/>Look (There is no vertical looking)<br/>Left Click<br/>FireRReloadFFlare", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c7c2d4e340fb92c8dcb635ae7be28e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MallleDive"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
