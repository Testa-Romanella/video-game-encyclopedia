A game that has weathered the test of time, and now space!</p>\n<p>For our first game and\u00a0entry into Game Off 2020, we decided to take the theme, 'Moonshot,' pretty much literally. In our prototype Puzzle Mode, the goal is to sink the blue planet into a black hole in a single shot, using any means necessary\u2014ricochets, compound shots, and good ol' gravity, all possible in the three (3) most popular dimensions. Eventually, we hope to add a more traditional billiards experience, expand on the puzzles available, add multiplayer, and include other wacky ways to play. Let us know what you think, and thanks for playing!
