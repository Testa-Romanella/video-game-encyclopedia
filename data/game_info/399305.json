The challenge we had was to combine two Atari 2600 games that we had made at the start of the year. The two games we had were Canyon Bomber and Missile Command. In this game we try to capture the fixed horizontal movement\u00a0and canyon destruction of Canyon Bomber and the base defense and the disabling missiles from Missile Command.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a multiplayer\u00a0game where you control your own Spider Mech and are trying to destroy the base of the opposing player. Use your Mech's cannon to shoot projectiles or use your EMP to block incoming shots. Shoot the speed boost or shield power-ups to give yourself a short advantage.</p>\n<p>As the aiming we wanted to achieve was impossible with mouse and keyboard we decided to use PS4 controllers for the controls of the game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nMovementLeft JoystickAimingRight Joystick<br/>ShootingR2EMPL2\r\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Song used for the game scene.</p>\n<p>Controversia by Electronic Senses | https://soundcloud.com/electronicsenses<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/<br/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T05:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48f/48f2db6ed114dcccf5e432d713255743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan Williams"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
