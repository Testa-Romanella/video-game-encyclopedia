However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man...<br/><br/>\"...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!\"<br/><br/>Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight...<br/><br/>\"There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?\"<br/><br/>With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals.
