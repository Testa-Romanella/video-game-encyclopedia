We wanted to make a moody fantasy game about exploring and changing a multiverse, or a world that had been broken up into many little pieces.</p><p>For the last few game jams, we'd made platformers that required a download and we wanted to explore something outside of that genre that we could publish directly to web.</p><p>So, after a bit of prototyping and a lot of CSS, we present \"La Roue de Fortune\", a game where you explore and control the multiverse using a deck of Tarot cards. </p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Tarot de Marseille images provided by http://www.cbdtarot.com/ </p><p>Music is \"(Intro)\" by Fyrnask http://fyrnask.bandcamp.com/ . </p><p>Background images courtesy of: </p><p>https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/14700182324<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/centenico/6175673029<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/manhattan104/6778698846<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/mualphachi/12242256733<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/hotair2112/255860717/<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/rlanvin/11683138804<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/fauxto_dkp/2653724159<br/> https://www.flickr.com/photos/msavagephotography/14100149394</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873aed6aedfb7e9edf3d84033d5a5291.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arrogant.gamer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
