Everytime the whole bar of any player is consumed, the rival team scores one point.<br/><br/>There is also an energy bar, which allows players to sprint (in order to dodge hits or reach for contested balls), or to make special shots (which do much more damage than normal ones). This bar recharges over time.</p><p>There are 3 difficult levels.<br/></p><p>Play alone or with friends on a several multiplayer modes. Cooperative, 1vs1 or 2vs2</p><p>There are 8 teams in Jammerball, and all of them have their own unique arena. Each team has a specific weakness in some aspect of the game, with only two exceptions: one with no weaknesses, and one with all of them.</p><p><strong>Drunken Brothers</strong> (all weaknesses) \u2013 Drunken Dome<br/><strong>Broken Wings</strong> (weak speed) \u2013 Wingless Garden<br/><strong>The Scratchers</strong> (weak shooting potency) \u2013 Little Claw Palace<br/><strong>Tired Spirits</strong> (weak energy recharging speed) \u2013 Yawning Center<br/><strong>Exhausteds</strong> (weak total energy) \u2013 Weakness Palace<br/><strong>Rubber Souls</strong> (weak resistance) \u2013 Bouncing Colliseum<br/><strong>Soapy Hands</strong> (weak catching ability) \u2013 Slippery Ground<br/><strong>Mighty Highers</strong> (no weaknesses) \u2013 The Very Best Garden</p><p>Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpDT14z2FBE<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e17dd3f1a33c31bf715aa88b335c259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DKWorld Entertainment"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
