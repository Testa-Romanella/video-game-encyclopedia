This is an endless runner game with a twist.</p>\n<p>This is a game about real bacteria that affect people. We thought this game would be relevant because of the current pandemic. The aim was to also create a library along with the game, with information regarding all the infections these bacteria cause as a way to create awareness but we ran out of time before we could finish it. We hope to finish it in the future but for now I hope you guys enjoy this version :)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Press the left arrow key to move left and the right arrow key to move right.</p>\n<p>This game also supports touch.
