I hope I succeeded, but at least don&#39;t let the intro text scare you off.&quot; - SCF, creator of the game.</p>\n<p>Hilbert is a young village boy, who believes he is the protector of his town and aspires to become a hero one day. As he makes an interesting discovery that further increases his ambitions, he must now battle against politicians and fight to win people, and save the world from an obscure race of people who had vanished hundreds of years back. Most importantly, he must now discover what being a hero truly means.</p>\n<p>Last Scenario features 25+ hours of gameplay, a huge world to explore, a story line that will keep you wanting more and best of all, HEX, its own trading card mini-game.
