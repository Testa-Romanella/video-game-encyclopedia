But then this years mix and jam had the same theme but I was doing game off so I wasn't able to do it. So I've been working on it for the last month of 2020 and am\u00a0going to make that game for the\u00a0Finally Finish Something Jam 2021 and I'll submit it to\u00a0INDIE LIFT 2020 for feedback. I used this to create my character and zombies\u00a0(I changed it to make it topdown) and this to make the tileset.</p><p>Bugs:</p>\n<p>*If you cant use the keyboard press back and forth in the browser*</p>\n<p>*Might not work in some browsers*</p>\n<p>*Menu wouldnt load so I removed it*</p>\n<p>Possible Updates:</p>\n<ul><li>Level update (Spikes, HP pickups)</li><li>Boss</li><li>Upgrades</li><li>More enemies</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9ff005cec1b9af1c2067ecbd3e85b95d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PepperBoi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
