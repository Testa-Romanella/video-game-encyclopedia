A place where all of your dreams can come true, and where there's absolutely for sure nothing sinister going on behind the scenes whatsoever! Don't believe me? See for yourself!</p>\n\n<p>This game is my Senior Capstone for my Creative Computing Minor. When presented with the option to make whatever I\u00a0wanted, I decided to go ahead and try game development.\u00a0\u00a0Since this was my first time creating a game in Unity, I had a lot of trouble getting used to the development environment, learning C# and just in general trying to get my vision across.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0ran into quite a few issues and difficulties during development, but I am proud of the product in its current state. All of the characters, storylines, backgrounds, and any other visuals you see in the game (with the exception of the fonts and pause button) were hand drawn by me. The shark that can be found in the cave (spoiler) was actually made by me out of clay, then imported into Photoshop where I colored the body, added the eyes,\u00a0 and animated the fin. I believe that this is the coolest thing I've ever made, and I hope you like it. I am aware that it is a rather short game, but I hope to continue working on expanding the story and quests in the future so please stay tuned!</p><p>* Download exe does not currently run on M1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T22:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79006879df92e082bdc704bc7fc9529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["londonkasper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
