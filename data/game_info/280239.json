It's not particularly a model heavy game but it's about how those models interact with each other and change slightly that matters. Most of the model work was handled by Samina Trachier while most of the code was done by Kevin Ray and Mary Li. This was made as part of a 6 week assignment for our Game Development course and I think we all learned a lot from this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kevin Ray</p>\n<p>Samina Trachier</p>\n<p>Mary Li</p>\n<p>3D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/8748f8e227a0d9a3fd95fcf59ace593e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Ray"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
