If only someone could come along and blast them out of the way!</p>\n<p>Minimum Viable Tower is a puzzle(ish) game with the goal of getting the highest possible score in each level. Blast useless support beams out of the way to make the least stable tower that can still stand. </p>\n\n<p>You get points for blasting blocks, but if they are high up in the tower they will likely be worth more to you when the final points are tallied. </p>\n<p>Created in Unity, using Aseprite for the art and Audacity for sound effects.
