To do that, you\u2019d need to harvest resources, craft tools, burn fires, melt the ice, plant trees and produce oxygen. Estimated time for the task: over 9000 years.<br/><br/><strong>Or you can make robots to do that for you!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Enter CraftoMate! They can be scripted with <strong>visual programming</strong> to perform all kinds of tasks. <br/><br/>More importantly, they can be <strong>assembled and upgraded</strong> with surrounding materials.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Even more importantly: you can program them to harvest and craft those materials and eventually become a sustainable workforce, capable of <strong>terraforming the entire planet</strong>.<br/><br/>Just don\u2019t forget to feed them once in a while\u2026 Though you can program them to do it themselves, too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T04:27:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/982e7823829a0ea169efcc14dbedfa1d.jpg", "website": "https://luden.io/craftomation/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Luden.io"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Luden.io"], "esrb_rating": null}
