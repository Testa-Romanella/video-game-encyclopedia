It uses Bevy Engine and was originally submitted to https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The basic gameplay should be familiar to anyone who has ever played Tetris. Use Arrow Keys to move the dropping block around and try to land it next to same colored blocks to manipulate their numbers. The target is to *combine* numbers in way that they result to tens (0, 10, 20, 30, etc). Oh, and you can switch the color of the dropping block using shift key (see full keymap below).</p>\n<p>You will get points based on the value that the block has before it breaks. As the maximum value of a block is 99 the highest score you can get\u00a0from single block is 99.</p>\n\r\nKeymap\r\n<ul><li>Left / Right: Move the block left/right</li><li>Down: Speed up the dropping block</li><li>Shift: Switch the color of the dropping block</li><li>Q: Switch the color to Blue</li><li>W: Switch the color to Red</li><li>E: Switch the color to Yellow</li><li>R: Switch the color to Green</li><li>1: Background music track #1</li><li>2: Background music track #2</li><li>3: Background music track #3</li><li>M: Mute background music</li></ul>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>The code is open source as requested in Bevy Jam rules.
