The game features two playable protagonists, Edmund and Eliza. Edmund's section of the game focuses on his exploration of the village in search of a way into the castle, where he believes Eliza is being held captive. Eliza's section of the game focuses on her searching for a way to escape the castle so she can reunite with her father. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay of Edmund and Eliza is similar to that of Dark Souls and Resident Evil. The game is a short experience, about one to two hours long. The combat is fun and thrilling, yet deliberate and attentive, and punishes the player for poor positioning and timing. The game also has large levels the player can explore, with lots of things to do. The player has an inventory where they can store items, such as keys for unlocking doors and drinks that restore their health. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe art style and graphics of Edmund and Eliza is reminiscent of the Play Station 2 era of video games. Edmund and Eliza is meant to harken back to that time period and remind players of their childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy Edmund and Eliza!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T04:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25e9bdcdc04368837e06bde09f524bec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 540, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avik Shenoy", "Thanh Tran", "Amir Roochi", "Brendan Beagin", "Daniel Sarkisian"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Avik Shenoy"], "esrb_rating": null}
