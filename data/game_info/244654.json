{"id": 244654, "slug": "terra-labyrinth", "name": "Terra Labyrinth", "name_original": "Terra Labyrinth", "description": "<p>Terra Labyrinth is a side-scrolling action adventure where you must find items to make your way to the next area. It features three items, four areas, and a variety of different rooms that are randomized each time you play. One play-through should last 15-20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Terra Labyrinth was made for\u00a0Godot Wild Jam. It was developed in Godot 3.0.2. It follows the theme of\u00a0<em>evolution</em> as you adapt to the labyrinth through new abilities. It was made in one week by fornclake and TheRetroDragon. We have many plans to expand upon this game.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Regular controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left and Right (arrow keys) to move</li><li>Z or V to jump</li><li>X to swing sword</li><li>Up to enter doors</li><li>Enter to leave menus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Ability controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>C to throw boomerang</li><li>Left or Right + Down + Z to slide</li><li>Left or Right while sliding down wall + Z to wall jump</li></ul>\n<p>Also has controller support.
