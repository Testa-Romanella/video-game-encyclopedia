Hands are 11 cards. The leading suit is the trump suit for that round, and the highest value in the trump suit wins. If you have a card matching the leading suit, you must play it.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to start the game and to select cards.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam, my first TIC-80 game, my first completed game, and my second piece of software written in fennel. I had a lot of fun making it, and I hope it brings you some enjoyment as well! :)</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about me, I keep a personal website at micklemeal.space.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T10:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d502f7844e76005da43e10403c29e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["mikemehl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
