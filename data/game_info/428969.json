Quick, what angle is this??<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Did you say 34\u00b0? No? Then you're dead.<br/><br/>In Angle Wars you need to make split-second decisions, commanding your men where to move and what direction and angle to shoot, if you're going to win!  Control soldiers using a variety of weapons and abilities, across an array of battlefields and game modes, in either turn-based or real-time combat. Battle your way to the top, earning ranks and medals with each victory!<h3>Up to four players can team up or play free-for-all, in local or hotseat multiplayer.</h3><h3>Four different game modes</h3><ul><strong>Target Practice</strong> -- Practice solo, or compete with friends to see who is the fastest, most accurate marksman.</ul><br/><ul><strong>Battleground</strong> -- Spend your command points to purchase 8 different troop types, from a basic Rifleman to the air-strike calling Major. Each battleground can be fought in turn-based mode, for the more strategic-minded, slow-fingered commanders; or in real-time mode, for the twitchy impulsive types.</ul><br/><ul><strong>Duel</strong> -- Choose your weapon...then lead a single soldier to victory, murderizing your opponents with deadly speed and accuracy!</ul><br/><ul><strong>Survival</strong> -- Play alone, or co-op, to see how many waves of enemies you can withstand! You can earn battle points to buy more weapons and ammunition between waves, but you'll need to stay on your toes, calling shot after shot accurately to survive.</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/3012139726147d355bf1d7491df58cad.jpg", "website": "http://www.anglewars.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Pesto"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Pesto"], "esrb_rating": null}
