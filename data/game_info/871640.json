If you are sensitive or otherwise offended by these subjects, please do not play this game.</p>\n\n<p>An abandoned factory in the ghost city of Magnus is the home of the numerous disappearances of several tourists and horror enthusiasts. Jerry, the independent journalist, learns of this and decides to investigate the factory. Little does he know that the reason many people have gone missing was because of an evil witch that lies at the heart of the factory, who haunts and kills anyone that dares disturb her. As the journalist, you decide that you don't want to be here anymore and you imagine neither does anyone else who could still be alive and trapped there. Your job is to escape the factory with the rest of the witch's victims unscathed. As you escape the factory, you may encounter some scouts that serve to alert the witch of your presence, so take care not to let them see you! Good luck and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>WASD - move camera</p>\n<p>Left click - select survivor or hiding spot</p>\n<p>Left click/Drag - select multiple survivors or hiding spots</p>\n<p>Right Click - move or ungarrison survivors to mouse position</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a6730c516c49538a9347cef114634a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeegYoshi979"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
