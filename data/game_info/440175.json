(EdwardTReyes)", "description": "<p>This game focuses on a feeling that some people might have. I don't want to spoil that feeling and would rather the player figure it out themselves. This game has a main player and is mainly focused around the games art to tell a story. My game is very linear, bringing the player on a path that they can just indulge. Trying to get some music for it, don't know if it will work. Otherwise, enjoy the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:43:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/152bd7833c6dd0bbf1e7b1ac8e259e86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EdwardTReyes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
