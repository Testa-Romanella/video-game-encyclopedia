(If it's the first play)<br/><br/>While the in-game battles and expeditions are 'automatic', you will still need to keep an eye on each expedition. If the survey succeeds, it is nothing. But if it fails You'll need to sit back and analyze and figure out how to deal with what caused you to fail. Whether it's because of events within the exploration area.

Use google translate more than 80% (You can skip the story)<br/>- UX, UI can be toxic to many beginners Takes some time to get used to.<br/>- Some pictures are not drawn by myself and may look a bit contrary.<br/>- Because it's the first time that I have written the code myself. Some systems are therefore not as good as they should be.<br/>- At the end of the game, there may be a slight delay when loading the bag. (Sorry very much which is still unresolved)<br/>- feeling tired easily You might think that 5 hours have passed, even though you've only played for an hour.<br/>- You can report bugs. But secretly played 5 rounds, thinking that there was no bug that prevented the game from being finished<br/><br/>I don't have confidence in UX, UI at all. In the beginning, no matter how it came out, I felt that it was beautiful and looked good... (Just thinking about it myself) :l Including writing code too. Once I get used to it, I'm at a point where it's difficult to fix anything (very sad).<br/><br/>But it's the first game that I wrote myself. It would be great if you played it and enjoyed it like me (I really hope).<br/>If anyone buys to play and can play until the end of the game Don't forget to stop by to show off some (very excited). The game is quite difficult in the early stages that you have to learn the system. (and get used to UX, UI) once you get used to the game system. It will start to feel more and more challenging (and feel very tired as well). Overall, it is quite difficult. But it should be fun and can be played chilling...
