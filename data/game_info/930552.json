It doesn't abstract systems like encumbrance or supply or use narrativist mechanics like exchanging narration rights between the GM and players.</li><li><strong>...fast &amp; light.</strong> Freehack has almost no rules to explain, all rolls are performed by the GM and it uses simultaneous turns. All these features keep the game fast and easy for players to grasp, especially in text-based games.</li><li><strong>...ultra-generic.</strong> Freehack makes no assumptions about setting or theme. The unique roll mechanic allows the GM and players to choose the level of complexity they like, one game can have six modifiers for an attack roll while another can have only one. The sections system supports divides between different modes of gameplay without assuming that your game includes any specific mode like combat.</li></ul><p>I hope someone will find this useful!Licensed under the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal (CC0) license, placing this work in the public domain.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c66/c66761e5dfc263a3d021a0d7556bff56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amini Allight"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
