The systems that were intended to run this game were the NES and the PC's MS-DOS operating system (although it could work on Microsoft Windows with some effort). The DOS version was more faithful to the television program than the NES version (which simply was an action/shooter game with little connection to the TV series).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a574e1e9d7b31c0f89644f702eb2a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Realtime Associates"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Hi Tech Expressions"], "esrb_rating": null}
