Armed with only your canoe, your wits, and your imagination, it is up to you where the waters will take you. Will you go to a magical island or to sacred hunting grounds? Perhaps you will listen to an interesting musical performance out on the ocean or maybe you will venture into a forest where humans and trees are friends. No matter what you do, it is certain you will come back home from this adventure with something you didn\u2019t have before! This game requires only a few minutes of imagination and aims to brighten your day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f77/f77694b32f56a28ff245ad43dd7908b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Julia Z."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
