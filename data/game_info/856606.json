I really did my best with this one!</p>\n<p>After the long, multi-level effort of \"Will of the Spider\" a short, two-level game is just what I needed.</p>\n<p>Plus, this meant that I could put in more detail around the place that I wouldn't have had the time to otherwise. Especially the music and little animated moments there are.</p>\n<p>Plus, Sin and Cos are very useful, did ya know???</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T06:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4f020f7425206ec6c4b021f42a644a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
