I also learned a fair bit more about procedural generation (the city is randomly generated), and I also improved my 3rd person character controller script a lot for this to allow the various forms of movement in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fc49909e578babcdf4060f172e8e29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jfc3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
