There is a lot of polish required, but this should be mostly 'bug-free' that would cause a crash or ruin the fun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*WARNING*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is still a lot of balancing required! any notes or comments are greatly appreciated and will be incorporated where possible. Please let me know if you'd like to be listed in the credits as an alpha-testing for suffering through this early version.</p>\n\n\n<p>---------- :GAMEPLAY: ----------</p>\n<p>The Pawns have an A.I. system that is <strong>ALWAYS\u00a0</strong>running, regardless of whether they have Free-will turned on or not.\u00a0 They currently resist your commands a bit too much, which will be corrected in future updates and implementation of the 'Loyalty' system.</p>\n<p>Free-will works faster, has bonuses to stamina, increased movement bonuses, and improved auto-dodge. <strong>BUT!\u00a0</strong>Pawns will push themselves into either Aggressive or Defensive attitudes, which can lead to Rage and Panic, which tend to be self-destructive.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>- : HELPFUL CONTROLS : -</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Double right-click</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clears the Pawn's brain and cancels the current action. This improves responsiveness to movement commands or to dodge attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>-Double select skill\u00a0</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Either double click or double hotkey makes the skill the Pawns top priority. This will not break them out of 'Panic' or 'Rage'.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is currently <strong>NO negative cost</strong> to either of these actions.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>:NAVIGATION:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*ESC* - this opens a super basic menu system on all screens. This is currently WIP, but the important bits work (<strong>VOLUME, FULLSCREEN, END GAME</strong>).<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>:ROADMAP:</strong></p>\n<p>Currently aiming for an update every 2-weeks. Primarily with bug fixes and one larger add on (New character, Collection system, Structured gameplay).</p>\n<p>Next Update:</p>\n<ul><li>1 New Character.</li><li>More 'God-Powers'\u00a0 (<em>Extension of Free-will playstyle</em>)</li><li>Fixes to the loyalty/faith system.</li><li>Fixes to controls &amp;\u00a0responsiveness.</li></ul>\n<p>Future Updates:</p>\n<ul><li>LOTS OF NEW CHARACTERS.\r\n</li><li>More 'God-Powers'\u00a0 - and themed god powers.</li><li>Collection/Wallet of Pawns.</li><li>Convert / Capture gameplay element.<br/>\n</li><li>Save function.</li><li>Tutorials / Gameplay introduction.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>: ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS :</p>\n<p>A big personal thank-you from myself for checking this game out and a profuse apology for suffering through something in such a raw state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have used assets from all over the Itch community.
