Want to beat your best times? Then try Run to the End, a game where a course is procedurally generated for you so that you can quickly run through it to get to the goal. Run, jump, and dodge obstacles as you make your way to the goal post.</p>\n<p>There are two courses to choose from. Try the Hill course with its platforms and mounds, or the Path course, which has a road to the finish. Don't think that will be easy, though. You'll have to run around flames, landmines, and fire breathing dragon statues in order to get to the end. When all that is said and done, you can save the course in order to try for your best time. The courses come with a code which can be shared with friends (No online features supported).<br/></p>\n<p>Only have a keyboard and mouse? No problem! Run to the End supports that. Would you like to use a controller? There's support for that, too!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: this game is still in development, so bugs and breaks are to be expected. Proudly made in the Godot engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b827a8375e824889daa011dd0330e931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ertain"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
