{"id": 674924, "slug": "paradise-mecha", "name": "Paradise Mecha", "name_original": "Paradise Mecha", "description": "<p>Your ship has crash landed on a small island some where in the pacific ocean. All systems have been shut down. Nothing works, except for a single mecha. The enemy ship, packed full of mechas and fighter jets,\u00a0is hot on your trail, and will arrive at any moment, 30 seconds to be exact. As it is, your only course of action is to fight them all off by yourself, while defending your own ship from being destroyed. Quite a lot rests on your shoulders.</p>\n\n<p>Your mecha is equipped with both a sword and blaster cannons. Use them to their full extent by hacking, slashing, and blasting your way through any enemy mechas, and maybe a ship or two (Though hopefully not your own).</p>\n<p>You'll eventually have square up, and\u00a0go head to stern\u00a0with the enemy ship. But\u00a0 you won't be able to touch it till you destroy all of its turrets.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for!\u00a0Go fight some mechas!</p><p>Update notes:</p><p>I realized to late I was using the wrong materials for the mechas and ships, so I've reuploaded with the proper colors. Everything else is the same.\u00a0</p><p>You can still play the original jam version if ya want.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/52729e07658d50c5d9d49aa67f22159c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pocket Fun"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
