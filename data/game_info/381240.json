The player is encouraged to pick the garbage up and then spend some time enjoying the pristine beauty of the place. The idea is to not just view the 360-degree panorama, but to interact with it, develop a connection with it, and experience it fully.<br/><br/>All you need is a browser running on a desktop or a mobile or, for the best experience, a VR device. <br/><br/>Plastic pollution is a serious worldwide problem. Educating the public about it, and helping them modify their behavior are important steps towards mitigating this problem. <br/><br/>Make our world pristine again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41e60faf661aec5aa5d1a1e097d5acdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vintch"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
