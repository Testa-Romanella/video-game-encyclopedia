However, the piece has been cursed, and monsters lurk behind the panels as they slowly descend into darkness.\u00a0Survive for 5 minutes, where each minute, a new panel will be forced open. If a monster appears there, sacrifice a white panel in order to cover the panel where the monster lies. There are 3 monsters, each with their own personality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the game starts, hit 3 tiles to begin.</p>\r\nIn-Depth Rules\r\n<p><strong>The Eye</strong> - If too many panels are open, the Eye will slowly appear, and jump you when the opportunity comes. The blue tile will reset the eye, but use it wisely, as you won't be able to use it again after.<br/><strong>The Wooden Face</strong> - If you try to place a white tile where you have already reached the limited amount of empty tiles, a face will slowly appear. It'll also jump you when the opportunity comes. The yellow tile will reset the wooden face, but you won't be able to use it again after.\u00a0<br/><strong>The Monsters</strong> - If too many monsters are on screen and you feel like you can't place white tiles fast enough, then hitting the red tile will cover all of them up. The red tile is one-time use as well.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Making\r\n<p>Submission for the Paint Jam 2020.\u00a0<br/>(Note: I\u00a0am very sorry if the use of Paint was underutilized, but I made sure the graphical style of Paint, which I\u00a0hope makes it clear. Thank you!)<br/>Stuff I used:\u00a0My camera, Paint.NET, MS Paint, Unity, LMMS + Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/150f33e1f13faaacb5ab24a4ee467e08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Braveo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
