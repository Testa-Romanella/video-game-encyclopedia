You are the first one to arrive and while relaxing near the fireplace, the innkeeper offers you some coins and free lodgings if you help him with a pest problem. Although you are tired, the promise of extra money calls you to accept the request.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Your objective is to go down to the 10th floor of the cellar and deal with the rat problem. You need to make sure your lantern stays lit, otherwise you start to slowly lose your sanity in the darkness and go mad.</p>\n<p>You move by clicking the tiles and you can pick up items by standing over them and clicking the item's name on the list that appears on the top-left side of the screen. You can view your inventory and stats by clicking the backpack icon and from there you can also use your items by clicking them. Equipped items go into your currently active equipment slot. You can turn on and off your lantern by clicking the lantern button.</p>\n<p>The game is played using mouse.
