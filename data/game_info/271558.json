To escape the castle and its curse shepherd must sacrifice (<strong>Purple Bar</strong><strong>)</strong> his poor experiments and stay alive\u00a0<strong>(Red Bar)</strong> at the same time. The problem is, most harmful spells the shepherd knows\u00a0also require him to sacrifice his own health. What an idiot.\u00a0Also, the owner of the castle is not a good person, or whatever it is, so the sacrifice points drain over time.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Spells:</strong></li><li><strong>Drain\u00a0</strong>- after a short charge-up, continuously steals health from living objects around the user, slowing down fall and movement speed.
