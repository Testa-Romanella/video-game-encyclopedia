{"id": 587283, "slug": "neko-mania", "name": "Neko Mania", "name_original": "Neko Mania", "description": "<p>Neko (\u732b) is the Japanese word for cat. It can refer to an actual cat or to a character in anime or manga that has catlike features. The word is derived from an earlier, Old Japanese, nekoma (\u732b\u9b54), an onomatopoeia for the sound a cat makes; which is to say, neither mew nor meow, but \u732b\u9b54. A catgirl (nekomimi: \u732b\u8033, literally cat ears), or neko for short, is a female character with catlike traits, such as cat ears, a cat tail or other feline features on an otherwise human body. A Maneki-neko (\u62db\u304d\u732b), literally meaning \"beckoning cat\", is a common Japanese figurine (lucky charm, talisman) which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner.
