IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This game trusts both players to play according to standard chess logic. There is\u00a0<em>no </em>underlying logic to protect both players. So please be careful when moving a piece!<br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em><br/></strong></p>\r\nChess is more\r\n<em>Each death of a piece allows you to upgrade another unit.<br/></em>\n<p><strong>Local Multiplayer: Pass the mouse after your turn and hit the \"End Turn\" button</strong></p>\n<p><strong>William Porter - Art, A small amount of programming (for earlier Godot version)<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong><em>Daniel Nguyen - All Unreal Programming</em></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Left-Click </strong></em><strong>moves units, <em>Right-Click</em> upgrades.</strong></p>\r\nMovement\r\n<p><em><strong>Pawns</strong></em> can move only one square forward</p>\n<p><strong>Rookes</strong> can move the entire board only in vertical or horizontal lines</p>\n<p><em><strong>Queens</strong></em> can move the entire board in any direction but only in a straight line</p>\n<p>The <em><strong>King</strong></em> can move one square in any direction<br/></p>\n<p>If your King(s) die, it's game over.</p>\r\nUpgrades\r\n<p>If a unit dies the player gains one point to spend on other units. Pressing\u00a0<em>Right-Click</em> on the desired Unit allows the player to purchase the upgrade required. Players can also purchase an extra King to help protect them against a potential game over scenario.</p>\n<p>1 point = Rooke</p>\n<p>2 points = Queen</p>\n<p>3 points = King</p>\r\nThank you!\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy! It was a tough project for me initially but Daniel helped tremendously with the coding logic and converting to unreal! Maybe in the future I'll be trying again in Godot to properly cement my understanding of that engine!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/97387a1e284f12ca441041e57121f57e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AzureFoxStudios", "dtnguyen277"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
