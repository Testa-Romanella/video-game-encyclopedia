Your sensors have revealed\u00a0that the nearby planet has the resources that you need for your repairs\u00a0 - but you have no body, no arms, and no way to dig them out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>After eons of sitting with this\u00a0sadness, you decide to use what's left of your\u00a0CPU (the undamaged bits) to invent a new species of life that can survive on the planet and help with your repairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In \"lil guys\" you will hatch, raise, and eventually set loose your lil guys.
