I hope you enjoy this prototype of the experience, preferably in fullscreen mode.\r\n</p><br/>\n<p><strong>How to Play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You play as the messenger between celestial beings, the planet Orin and the surrounding stars Mira, Siri, Nasu, and Vena. \r\n    Click and Drag the screen to move your view through space, and interact with the characters by clicking on them. \r\n    Read through the dialog and enjoy the scripted interactions that attempt to share poetry and wisdom from The Prophet. \r\n</p><br/>\n<p><strong>Music Used<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Infinite World (Minecraft Inspired Chillstep) by Cub3x<br/>Creative Commons - Music slightly modified, reduced drums<br/>\r\n    https://soundcloud.com/cub3x/cub3x-infinite-world<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Icons Used<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\r\n    The icons depict the symbols from the Seven Chakras system, I felt these would be could visual indicators, and I tried to relate their usage to struggles in the game.\r\n<br/>Icons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com</p><br/>\n<p><strong>Images Used<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The background image in the game and on this page is a repeatable texture of a space nebula.
