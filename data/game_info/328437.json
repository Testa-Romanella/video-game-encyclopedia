Later on, you encounter with other characters that will later on help you on your journey. The battle system is <strong>based on randomness</strong> and you really need to know how to trick it in order to win a battle.</p>\n<p>I really\u00a0hope you like it. This is the first time that I release a game that took me so much time in development and that gave a lot of headaches.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by me Alejandro Ramos with the help of a friend that made some sprites for the backgrounds.</p>\n<p>This is a <strong>DEMO,\u00a0</strong>so it is very short,\u00a0although it may <strong>CHANGE</strong>, to fix errors and complete it even more.</p>\n<p>If you liked the game and the idea please let me know on my twitter:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/arcramos2</p>\n<p>Or email:</p>\n<p>arcramos2contact@gmail.com</p>\n<p>(PS: I don't know if the Mac and Linux builds works just as the Windows build, but if not, please let me know).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fbe7b8f26ab48177ccda8ba0d86398f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alejandro Ramos"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
