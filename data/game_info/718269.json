Enter and explore four paintings and experience the effect of color and value close-up. Embedded through each landscape are a series of beacons that share stories about the artist and their work, interviews with experts, quotes from the artist and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More of a walking simulator than a game, the experience encourages exploration and is designed to work with museum education initiatives and can be customized to render any 2D artwork or object into a navigable, walkable,\u00a0landscape.\r\n</p>\n<p>The experience is customizable and could feature a variety of content types:</p>\n<ul><li>Audio: interviews, voice over, music, background/environmental audio, etc</li><li>Additional support imagery</li><li>Text</li><li>Video</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Who is this for?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Curators and exhibition design teams interested in adding depth to exhibition content.</li><li>Museum educators who want to design immersive programs around a compelling interactive experience.</li><li>Institutions looking for new ways to engage with a younger audience.\r\n</li><li>Art educators\u00a0interesting in new ways to engage students with content.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>For this project I chose four 2D works of art from across a range of eras and departments at the\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art\u00a0and rendered each of them as a landscape or topographic map. I used Rembrandt\u2019s\u00a0Self Portrait,\u00a0Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue\u00a0by Georgia O'Keeffe,\u00a0Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 70\u00a0by Robert Motherwell, and\u00a0A Rose\u00a0by Thomas Anshutz.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Platforms</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The project can be played through a downloaded application, through a web-browser or published as a VR experience.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Explore using your keyboard and mouse:\u00a0W - forward, A - left, S - backward, D - right, Space - jump (best to do while moving), Shift+WASD - run,\u00a0 Mouse - look\r\n</li><li>After hitting Run Game you may need to mouse click within the game to get keyboard/mouse focus.</li></ul>\n<p>For more projects visit\u00a0www.bradmack.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbfe447195940b3ebd0bf9d0fff017a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bradmack"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
