And my first ever completed game-project released for public consumption so i feel a something a little bit more subtle suits it better.</p>\n<p>This is an homage to the types of games i played growing up and started as a \"can i really do this\" -project. As such it's not the most stable game in the world as i was learning as i went along but it was alot of fun and i've learnt alot. Hopefully someone out there'll enjoy the hour or so it should take to play through it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689fba8cd3bf1d59c8171f0ee42abe1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mammothtree"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
