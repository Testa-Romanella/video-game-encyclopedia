His root prevents him moving too far. However, gathering fertiliser increases the length of the root.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Traverse a 3D environment and collect as much fertiliser as you can. The more fertiliser you collect, the more of the level you can access. Across the level there are a few carrots that can also be collected. These trophies are much more rare and valuable than the fertilisers.</p>\n<p>Vinny is equipped with a water gun, that allows him to grow \"PlantForms\" to access higher areas. Just point and fire the gun at soil patches scattered across the level.<br/></p>\n<p>[ CONTROLS ]</p>\n<ul><li>WASD -\u00a0Move</li><li>SHIFT - Sprint</li><li>MOUSE - Aim\u00a0Camera</li><li>M1 - Shoot</li><li>M2 - ADS</li><li>F - Shine Light</li><li>CTRL - Crouch / Dive</li><li>E - Melee\u00a0Attack</li></ul>\n<p>Game\u00a0Jam page -\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/vine-intervention-8</p>\n<p>The level in the Game\u00a0Jam build is incomplete and contains a few issues</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T12:07:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63c8f732efe188bb1791219dea9f082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RamyBro", "Jay Hutter", "Joshua Beard"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
