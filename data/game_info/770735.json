This game features two-player functionality, as well as some of the most dynamic scoring I've worked on so far. I personally added the ability for updating the high-score, as well as the methods for quitting the game without having to click the button on the player window.</p>\n<p>The goal with this clone is to recreate the gameplay of the arcade version. As such, I'm hesitant on adding a pause feature. Without it, the player is forced to focus on the game constantly, driving the aggressive engagement associated with these classic retro games. Of course all the overly annoying sounds are included, and I really enjoy the level of immersion they provide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I recognize the implication of intellectual property theft, and it is true this clone is far more to being an identical twin than my previous clones have been. As always, my efforts here are in the interest of education, and there is absolutely no point at which any of these games will be monetized. Due to sourcing all my sprites and sounds via The Weekly Coder, I am unable to assign any further credit to the game.</p>\n<p>CURRENTLY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</p>\n<p>Pac-Man is (of course) not without its bugs. I plan to address several issues I've found while playing the game. As always, I'll keep a running list of known bugs below and update it as I release further versions. All that being said, the game is playable (and fun) in its current state.</p>\n<p>Known Issues:</p><p>- The same sound plays when collecting fruit as when consuming ghosts. Would be nice to have variety.<br/></p>\n<p>- Possible issue with frightened mode in which the audio does not return to normal background audio. Only stumbled across this once, and haven't been able to recreate it since. If you encounter this issue please report it with as much detail as possible in the comments, so I can narrow down the cause.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c17c22691f0ca8402b33de7b82b91eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meter Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
