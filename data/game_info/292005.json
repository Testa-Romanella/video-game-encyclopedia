This requires a lot of multitasking, since one mechanic is too slow to reach all items. An unnecessary interact button press will take away a point from your score.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Left mechanic: A and D to move, S to interact</p>\n<p>Right mechanic: J and L to move, K to interact</p>\n<p>This is a submission for the wowie game jam. I took the topic, everything interacts with everything, or every mechanic interacts with every mechanic, very literally and made every mechanic (the job) interact with everything. Please leave feedback, I want to improve this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:33:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c63b10cdb4fee10a59aef3c8abc25d28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Evan M"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
