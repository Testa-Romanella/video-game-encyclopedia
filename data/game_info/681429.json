{"id": 681429, "slug": "castle-constructor", "name": "Castle Constructor", "name_original": "Castle Constructor", "description": "Choose your Blocks, Build your Castle, Save the Kingdom! <br/><br/>Castle constructor is a new take on the tower defense genre. Design your castle how you want it using a modular system of unique, interlocking, inter-working blocks. Stack them up high or spread them out across the map as you try to build the perfect defense. Landscapes like deserts, mountains, rivers, and hills come with their own advantages and challenges. Fend off waves of enemies who will try to climb over and break through your defenses. From lowly soldiers to powerful siege weapons, you will need to defeat them all as you strive to protect your kingdom.<h3>Game Modes:</h3><ul><li>Campaign - Play through multiple campaign levels to collect stars that will earn you new card tokens and which can be used to purchase techs.<br/></li><li>Endless Mode - Fight off endless waves of enemies, earning coins and purchasing new blocks and technology as you try to survive as long as possible.<br/></li><li>Creative Mode - Free play mode. With an infinite number of each card you can build your castle however you want it. Then you can design your own wave of enemies to send against your castle to see how it fares. </li></ul><h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li>Modular Castle Building - Build your castle out of multiple different blocks, stacking them up to 5 per tile and taking advantage of both height and adjacency effects. <br/></li><li>3d hex maps - Each map is made out of 3d hex tiles with different features like hills, cliffs, rivers, and more.<br/></li><li>Complex Pathfinding - No fixed paths here. Enemy paths will react as you build up your castle as well as when it is destroyed. Enemies are intent on getting to your keep, going around or even climbing over your walls if it will get them there faster.<br/></li><li>Projectile Physics - Projectiles are physically simulated and can end up hitting a different target or missing entirely.<br/></li><li>Techs - Purchase techs in the campaign or during an endless level to improve your towers. Make enemies climb slower, add more defenders to your walls, and more. </li></ul><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T11:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7b02e7c36cd4cfd30465f786d14be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Sisyphean Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Sisyphean Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
