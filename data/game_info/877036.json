Explore mazes, avoid terrible monsters and regain your lost limbs. Once you've assembled your body? Can you find your heart?</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Exploration</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Together Again</strong>\u00a0explores the notion of monsters in games as \"the other\", as villians or agents of pain and harm. In this game, the monsters who tear your limbs and block you from being complete are later revealed to be your friends and family who are desperately trying to mend a broken version of yourself (and who is resistant to their help). Metaphorically, you've ripped their bodies and pieced yourself together...through their sacrifice and love.</p>\n<p><em>Only once you're whole can you see what others have sacrificed for you...so that you may once again live whole. That sacrificial love becomes your heart. Finally, you've renewed yourself...but at what cost?</em></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p><strong>Game is fully playable from start to finish.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>Possible\u00a0edge case bugs here and there as expected for Game Jam games.
