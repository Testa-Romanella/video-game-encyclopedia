Delve deeper into the dungeon while playing as one of three classes with wildly different playstyles. But be warned! You can only stay on each floor for 10 seconds before losing health - don't let your greed get the better of you!</p>\n<p><strong>Ranger:</strong> Pure offense. Rain arrowy vengeance down on the heads of your foes from anywhere in the room!</p>\n<p><strong>Mage:</strong> Higher attack speed and the ability to summon ice barriers to freeze your foes or protect yourself!</p>\n<p><strong>Rogue:</strong> With a higher chance to find loot and the ability to slink away from any fight, you'll be in it for the big haul!</p>\n<p>There is a boss hidden deep within the dungeon. Can you reach it and wrestle away its glittering hoard?</p>\n<p><strong>===================================</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>[W][A][S][D] keys to move</p><p>[E] to open and close menu</p><p>[Space] for menu select</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Click to fire basic projectile</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Click to use Class Ability</p>\n<p>===================================\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Bullet Hell Jam 2021.
