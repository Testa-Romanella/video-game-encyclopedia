The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they\u2019re sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRead the family\u2019s thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can\u2019t help the Kaplans if they know there\u2019s a ghost in the house. It\u2019s up to you to decide how Dan\u2019s career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDan\u2019s relationships \u2013 to his work, his wife, and his son \u2013 react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe decisions you make will define the Kaplans\u2019 lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2013-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-11T19:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/313c5d9f37f1cc3a35fe419f3425d5bd.jpg", "website": "http://www.thenovelistgame.com", "rating": 2.87, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 684, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 45, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 45, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orthogonal Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
