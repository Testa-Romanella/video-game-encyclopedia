I figured it'd be pretty useful since I'm a total beginner to game development and I want to work towards something bigger.</p>\n<p>For my first week I decided to do a clicking game since I had a little idea. It didn't evolve much past \"click on a sprite to alter your score\". It was pretty fun at the beginning but I lost interest which resulted in not working on the game for three days straight. It was however, a great learning experience.\u00a0If it matters, the engine I use is GMS2.</p>\n<p><strong>Some useful things I learned here were:</strong></p>\n<p>-Making a working level system</p>\n<p>-Lots of practice with switch statements</p>\n<p>-How to make a custom cursor</p>\n<p>-General programming practice/work flow</p>\n\n<p><em>All art and music done by me except for the cover image!</em></p>\n<p>I'll try to keep these shorter next time, I just like to talk about my experiences</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5ff660bab3bcbdbfbaa350f098f60de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aether09"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
