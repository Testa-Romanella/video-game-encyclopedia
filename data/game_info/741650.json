Enough equipment boxes to kill a small horse! Yes, The Sword and the Fish is the game you&#39;ve been waiting for - assuming you have been waiting for an archaic-looking game wherein the hero is a scruffy amoral hick. What it lacks for presentation, it later makes up for in presentation! And all the while you can laugh along with the most ridiculous cast of characters to ever operate in an A-B, up, down, left, right universe. The ancient demonlord GWAR (yeah, that&#39;s right) has awakened and begun nefarious works, but all our hero CLIFFORD wants to do is rock out in a bad local band. Ambitions are for the weak! Alas, the fates are jerks and Clifford soon finds himself forced to save the world, like, three times. At least. Maybe even more!</p>\n<p>Join Clifford as he foils his village&#39;s local cult, gets headbutted by love, meets robots from the future, engages in tomfoolery, realizes the robots aren&#39;t really from the future, goes on trial for thuglettry, and tracks down and kills 7 powerful demons - before taking on Gwar himself!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T03:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f6b74f4e78ac46a2ab7f66c7a889541.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/7459/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
