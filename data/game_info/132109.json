Heavily influenced by DK2, but with a robotic and futuristic twist. Lead your army of Roomba's and Killbots towards the ultimate goal of assimilating all organic life. Expand, exploit and exterminate!<br/></p>\n<p>Your ultimate goal is to reach the next portal, but first you should first expand to gather metals and build an army. You will find it difficult at first!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Scroll: </strong>W,A,S,D or Mouse</li><li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Mouse wheel or Q,E</li><li><strong>Pause:\u00a0</strong>ESC</li><li><strong>Pick up unit:\u00a0</strong>Left click</li><li><strong>Drop unit:\u00a0</strong>Right click</li><li><strong>Jump to Gateway:\u00a0</strong>Space</li><li><em>NOTE: Scroll wheel probably won't work unless fullscreen.</em></li></ul>\r\nRequirements\r\n<p>Due to extensive use of video memory to improve performance, devices with low video memory will struggle (mobile especially will not work).</p>\n<p>WebGL is pretty much required. I may upload a native desktop build for Windows/OSX/Linux if there is interest.</p>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>GameMaker Studio 2</li><li>Asset Forge</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game programming and art done by myself, NickToony</li><li>Extensive play-testing by Athcon</li><li>KenneyNL assets used for UI and sounds</li></ul>\r\nExtra Tips\r\n<ul><li>Units have a limited aggro range. You must pick them up and place them where they're needed!</li><li>Roomba's will automatically place floors and fortify. Building a floor connects the tile. Fortifying a wall makes it harder to penetrate.</li><li>You can only build or place units\u00a0on tiles connected to your base. Wait for Roomba's to build out the tiles.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/0867fd19d89af18d738c0a6aaef20617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["NickToony"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
