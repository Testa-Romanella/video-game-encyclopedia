This short game was made for the occasion of the #CommunityGameJam. The theme given to participants was \"The Game is a Liar\", which inspired us to make a game about discerning lies from truth. Here is the gist of the plot: You are trapped in a facility built by an Artifical Intelligence that you built and that knocked you out 3 years ago. Why? You told it that it could never be a human, and it tends to disagree. Ensues a mind game inspired from the Turing Test where the AI makes statements that you must qualify as lies or truth, as that is an ability the AI believes only humans possess. But it would seem that the AI is not as harsh as you think....</p>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made by <em>ma9ici4n </em>( https://ma9ici4n.itch.io/) on art and <em>LilNarwhal</em> (real name Mathis Duguin, https://lilnarwhal.itch.io/) on programming and sounds.
