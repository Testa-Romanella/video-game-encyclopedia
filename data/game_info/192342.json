It was originally about space hoppers, but the concept didn't work and the game became this! It turned out to be pretty fun but, as you can see, did not meet the theme. I'm pretty happy with it, though I think it only needed the first game mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794ace0e461a92d3dc77272ede90e42a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
