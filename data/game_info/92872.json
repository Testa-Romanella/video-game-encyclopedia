Historically, the Space Zoo AI provided excellent care and the utmost comfort for all of the exotic space animals. However, the Space Zoo AI was recently corrupted by an unknown entity and is currently starving the exotic space animals and destroying any visitors.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Your mission is to save exotic space animals and get out of the Space Zoo before the Space Zoo AI cracks your ship's control software and does bad things (mostly explosions). Your ship's communication signature is coded to look like a sentry bot, but the ruse will be discovered if you make any hostile actions or touch any animals..\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Dr. Spacezoo Update Notes:<br/></strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\thttps://itch.io/t/11911/dr-spacezoo-update-notes\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/30364682f47d1cdf1eb5d3893c7f7310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SmashRiot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
