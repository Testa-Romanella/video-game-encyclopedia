The goal is simple. Draw lines to steer the ball to the flag picking up stars along the way. Needless to say, there will be obstacles to overcome in this simple pursuit. <br/><br/>The rules are straightforward. The more stars you collect, the higher you score. The fewer lines you draw, the higher you score. The sooner the ball reaches the flag, the higher you score. Follow these mantras and see how you stack up against others on Game Center.<br/><br/>Gravity could be a double-edged sword, so use the ball's momentum or other means of propulsion to get through most levels. The ball is fragile and moving obstacles have a tendency to shatter it.<br/><br/>This starter pack comes with 50 exciting levels filled with soothing music, amusing sound effects and even explosions. The levels may look easy at first but don't be fooled by their simplicity. Some could take an hour or more to solve and you will find yourself playing well into the night. But if you have that special knack and happen to breeze through these levels, rest assured, we will be adding more soon.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/>\u2022 Touch and drag one finger to draw one or more lines to steer the ball toward the flag<br/>\u2022 Double tap or press Play to start or stop the ball<br/>\u2022 To erase the lines, swipe across them with two fingers<br/>\u2022 Collect at least one star to clear each level<br/><br/>Happy steering!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b32aec0056fae4585259c93f3af380b.jpg", "website": "http://kineticbytes.com/home/steerphysics.aspx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kinetic Bytes"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Udayan Kale"], "esrb_rating": null}
