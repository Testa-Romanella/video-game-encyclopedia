{"id": 600134, "slug": "sword-harrisonke", "name": "SWORD (harrisonke)", "name_original": "SWORD (harrisonke)", "description": "<p>Sword is a 3D modeled art project for one of UW-Stouts game design classes in which the player can walk around multiple viewing spaces and teleport between levels through small interactive objects. It may have a VR port within the next few days as that has been the main focus of this project but interactions within VR have proven to be troublesome.</p>\n<p>My original prompt was the two of swords tarot card but before that I had also gotten the chariot so I\u00a0decided to focus upon Greco-Roman architecture for the build.\u00a0 I really wanted to go for a kitschy modern aesthetic as it heavily contrasted the Greco-Roman style but also fit in perfectly. I\u00a0feel I\u00a0did do a great job at capturing the feeling I\u00a0wanted though the lack of VR is a bit disappointing.\u00a0</p><p>Looking back I wish I\u00a0had asked for more help in the VR\u00a0aspect because I\u00a0feel I\u00a0could've accomplished a next level experience if I had it done for SGX. I've learned a lot about how obtainable VR\u00a0is and therefor I\u00a0will be working on this project and another over the summer to really push home the concept.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c32ec2f5d87e3844349b8bc9b3766a0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["harrisonke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
