She won\u2019t last long without expensive and rare medicine. But, alas, we are a poor family having barely enough funds to buy food. <br/>Fortunately, I met a  collector from a big city. He was just traveling through our village and looking for someone who could pull off a delicate request:  a painting, one of its kind, was hidden somewhere inside the old mansion. In exchange for the painting, the collector was offering a generous reward. I had no other options. Not wasting any minute, I mount the horse and head to the old mansion. I hope my daughter won't get worse. <h3>Game features:</h3><br/><br/><ul><li>First-person game<br/></li><li>Explore the old mansion that holds dark and dour secrets<br/></li><li>Horrifying ambient and sounds<br/></li><li>You can never guess what is waiting for you around the corner<br/></li><li>Realistic graphics that emphasizes the atmosphere of horror<br/></li><li>Achieved with CryEngine V</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T03:19:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e4776a79cbecb150f7463f0d3dced8.jpg", "website": "https://adrov1993.wixsite.com/adrovgames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 20, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 426, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdroVGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AdroVGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
