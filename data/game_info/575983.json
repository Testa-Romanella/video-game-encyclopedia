The purpose of this mod is to bring together the best aspects of all of the previous games and combine them into a single package with the main draw of multiplayer. Currently, the game only supports offline couch coop, however as of the upload of this build, development for online play will come into effect. There are 2 versions of the game available, an offline standalone version and a version that can be played on the web via HTML5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to have a pleasant multiplayer experience, using a first-party controller (xbox, playstation, or nintendo pro) should be used. However, the game does support input rebinding, and if you're desperate you can remap controls to be entirely on a keyboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please read the ReadMe for further information</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8ca4b8ca7ffcd5e05e788a3d6883cd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SmileJakoby"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
