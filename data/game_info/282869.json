sparked to life. suddenly, a gray speckled cat wearing a burgundy cloak climbed out of the screen and confronted chelladine<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"you've come here to learn more about this game\" the gray cat declared<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine turned her head to the side in bewilderment<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"no, i do not wish to know about your game, in fact i am not sure why i am here at all!\" mused chelladine<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe gray cat looked her in her ruby eyes<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"even past the beauty of your eyes, i can see the curiosity.\" the gray cat taunted<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine took out a small purse from her backpack. a ruby-like dangly dangled from the silver-trimmed pocketbook. she slowly and deliberately took out a small leaf, which she began to gnaw on<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe gray cat was visibly impatient<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"look, there's only one reason why anyone ever comes here, and it is because they require, no, need, information about nair's game,\" he said, dragging his ragged paw pads against his face, stretching it out downwardsly<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"downwardsly isn't a word,\" chelladine pointed out, swallowing the remainder of the mint tasting leaf in a pronounced gulp<br/>\n<br/>\r\nit was at this point the curator realized he was in an abstract construct<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator stepped back and conjured a knife in his paw. the knife was a pronounced silver with red accents bleeding through it, as if the knife's previous victim had been immortalized<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"downwardsly is probably not a word!\" he cackled. \"but nair was using wordpad for windows 10 when he wrote it, which he forgot did not have spell-check\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine liked the knife the curator was holding quite a bit. \"can i see your knife?\" she said, turning her head sideways in the same previously innocuous motion<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator tried to regain her focus. \"chelladine, do you realize you can read the script we are performing? why did you mention that misspelt word?\" he waved his knife around wildly<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine did not seem interested in metaphysical aberrations. she did seem interested in the knife, though. \"i wish to see your gorgeous knife!\" she asked again, a smile beginning to form on her precious ****ing face<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator looked toward the 4th wall, eyes beaming. \"with pleasure...\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator considered leaping forward and stabbing chelladine in the eye, but then scried the bottom of the store description to find out that this ends poorly for him and decided against it<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine turned around, panning over walls 1, 2, and 3, which were an endless verdant, canopy filled forest. vibrant rays of imaginary sun seeped through the soothing trees. wall 2 was perpendicular to the computer monitor which she had touched and which the curator had climbed out of<br/>\n<br/>\r\nit was at this point nair realized that despite his writing reticle having the appearance of a page, writing 10 pages for the description would be impossible since wordpad did not have page delineators. he searched around for a word count, or something similar that would give him an arbitrary goal to aim for<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator slashed frustratedly in 3 dimensions. \"nair! all you had to do was write a ****ing description for your ****ty game, and here i a-\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nunwilling to ponder the dynamics of the scenario, nair reverted the scene to a previous instance, remembering to check the box that prohibits the story's characters from being able to observe the medium they exist in<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine sat on the grassy floor. \"i love that this forest unpacks their grass. did you know there are lands that don't? huge, towering cubes of still-packed grass, looming over acres of raw dirt...such an unsightly spectacle\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator was dizzy, an all too familiar feeling. he looked down into his upturned paws, a gorgeous intricate handcrafted knife laying in them. chelladine's paws were above his, touching the knife<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"thank you!\" mused chelladine<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine sat on the grass with the knife in her paws, appreciating how the sun bounced off the silver and crimson. the silver had infinitely detailed oil-slick ravines, the crimson was like a bloody amber<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator sat across from her, sighing, paws on face with his head held low<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine sniffed and licked the side of the knife with her prickly tongue<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"hmm... i certainly can not figure out what kind of gem this is...\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator seized the opportunity<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"may i ask your name?\" he asked, tilting her chin up carefully enough to not risk hurting her with the knife she was observing<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"it's chelladine. the pleasure is mine. yours?\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"i'll tell you in a brief second, darling.\" the cat known as the curator said. \"chelladine, i would like to explain why this monitor is here in the middle of this forest. mind listening?\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"chelladine pulled out her gun.\" chelladine said while not pulling out her gun<br/>\n<br/>\r\n'****...', thought the curator<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"chelladine pulled out her gun....chelladine pulled out her gun....\" chelladine repeated<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator gazed at the hypnotized chelladine, who was clutching the knife with both paws while licking the broad side of it<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"chelladine pulled out her gun\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine sat lopsided, drooling and licking the side of the blade. the once rigid crimson amber was now melting, staining chelladine's white face and neck fur. her brilliant white silken bow was now nearly entirely red<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine spasmed and twitched, her eyes rolling towards the back of her head. \"chelladi...\" she choked out<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator snatched the knife back, accidentally slitting chelladine's palm<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"****...\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine awoke, her entire eyes a single color of red-black. crystallized saliva dripped from her heaving mouth, evaporating the grass it touched below<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator affixed the knife to the sheath inside his cloak<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine let out a heavy sigh and looked at the curator with her voided eyes. her voice was strained and deeper. \"alright, we're going to fix this. i'm not sure what happened, but you let someone touch the knife\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator looked away and spoke \"...i was trying to get closer to her to explain the game. we did not know licking causes reversion...\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nchelladine did a runic gesture and the forest repacked itself, everting into a flat endless void with faint offblack coordinates marking a grid. omnidirectional lighting flooded the scene<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"well then...\", the possessed chelladine stated stonily. \"now we know.\" chelladine sat down again, legs spread apart. \"hand me the knife\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator reached from his robe handed the sheathed knife to chelladine. on the silver and gold sheath was an estranged, elongated engraved cat<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"can we go back to an equal plane now?\" the curator complained<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"one moment, ****.\" chelladine unsheathed the knife brought it closer to her sullen, voided, eyes, staring at it closely. \"do you remember how crimson amber works?\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"don't **** with me, nair\", the curator said<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"don't **** with yourself,\" barked chelladine. \"never remove the sheath from your robe or we'll potentially lose the knife when reverting.\" chelladine aggressively reached into the curator\u2019s robe and rehooked the sheath. she took a few steps back and sat down with the knife<br/>\n<br/>\r\nwhipping her head back, chelladine gargled the crystals in her throat and pressed the knife into her tongue, enclosing the knife around her lips. through her closed mouth emitted a paining grunt of sheer discomfort. the grunt turned into an emasculated scream<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe knife fell to the floor, chelladine heaving over it, blood dripping onto the knife and reacting with black sparks. the blood coagulated and filled the grooves, and color began to come back to chelladine\u2019s eyes. the expansive gridlines stretched closer and closer, to the point where the offblack lines were a searing white. the interior of a baroque chateau materialized around the curator and a hooded cat laid were chelladine once was<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"my ****ing head...\" said nair, pulling back his hood<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator looked at his purpose, a white and brown sphinx grasping his head, wearing a burgundy and gray hoodie and white shorts with a wide gray cloth belt<br/>\n<br/>\r\nnair pulled and uncorked a vial of clear liquid from the desk to his left and gulped it down exasperatingly. the curator took a green vial and did the same<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"we need to be more careful next time.\" lamented the curator<br/>\n<br/>\r\nnair climbed up to his desk and stared at the printed parchment describing the plane they had recently disjointed from<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"do you have the knife?\" asked nair<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator's eyes widened in brief panic as he patted himself down in his robe. he located the knife from within his robe and placed it on nair's mahogany desk. the knife was tarnished and the embedded crimson amber was dull and desaturated<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator picked up the empty vials and brought them to the other side of the room<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"there's no way we're going to get this approved.\", mumbled nair, polishing the knife with a gray cloth<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator knew not to intervene. there was a correct time and this was not it<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe rubbing intensified, to the point where the cloth was developing tears. the curator stared downwards, back turned from nair, washing the vials<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe vigorous polishing did not cease. nairs forearms tensed as he swayed the cloth back and forth regardless of consequence. the knife pressed against scrap, then skin, then blood<br/>\n<br/>\r\nwith gritted teeth, and holding back tears, nair dipped the fountain pen into his own blood and scribbled something over the strewn parchment on his desk. he pressed his paws against his chest, feeling the silver and crimson amber nipple ring he was wearing<br/>\n<br/>\r\nhe arced his paw up, blood flecking into straight line over the walls and ceiling, and hurled the knife at the curator<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator did not flinch at the sudden whirl of air. the knife struck him in the back and the world collapsed<br/>\n<br/>\r\nthe curator lay curled in the forest next to the monitor, chelladine\u2019s hindpaw on his cheek, her weight pinning him down as she stood over him, her gun held to his head<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"i-it is not important that you know about cat notebook,\" the gray cat stammered, his tears spraying and balling on his hydrophobic cloak. \"what is important is
