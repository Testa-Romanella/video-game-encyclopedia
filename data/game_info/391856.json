You have been given a task: Go through the gates of Hell and destroy all the sin you can see. </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>You start with your sword and pistol, and you will find more weapons in the corners of Hell.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Show them your Holy Fury, and only then you shall be redeemed.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Penance </strong>is an <strong>oldschool style FPS</strong> with procedurally generated levels and gritty retro graphics, where you play as anthropomorphic lizard dude <em>(look I like lizards okay)</em>. The goal of the game is simple: Cause enough carnage and earn points from each kill, collect keys each level to get through the portals, then show off your highscore to your friends. The game has a Discord support, so people can see your score while playing. If you get high enough score, you will get the ending cutscene. Penance also has <strong>bunnyhopping </strong>that increases your speed, <strong>crouch-sliding </strong>and a <strong>rage mechanic</strong>, that when activated, gives you double damage to all weapons, except the sword does quadruple damage.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Default Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li><li>Left mouse button - Shoot</li><li>Right mouse button - Zoom</li><li>Scrollwheel and number keys - Change weapon</li><li>Z - Activate rage when yellow bar is 100</li></ul>\n<p>Controls should be able to be remapped from game launcher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I haven't tested controller with this game, it was created for mouse and keyboard in mind.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was simply made for fun, because it's something I felt like I wanted to play and I love oldschool style FPS games. It's probably not that difficult game for FPS players, but I am proud of this game and I find it fun and satisfying to play.</p>\n<p>I used a lot of feedback I got from Ironscale and Castle Rodok to make this game, but also learned a lot of new things. I hope you have as much fun playing Penance as I had making it!<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to share your highscore with me, join my Discord server! <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music was made by Fredrik Thrysoe: https://fredrikthrysoe.wordpress.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T20:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff0/ff04f410f5037e511db98168bc5a8ed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akselmo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
