Attacking enemies at close range give you ammo/health back. But, in order to win you must earn points by eliminating enemies from afar. With those mechanics in place, players must make spilt second decisions\u00a0 to ensure their survival while being constantly swarmed by enemies.</p>\n<p>Made with:</p>\n<p>GameMaker 1.4</p>\n<p>Bfxr</p>\n<p>Piskel</p>\n<p>Pixelland and Hachico fonts from DaFont.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc970fa35cebf4d47914cebf0a81745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dg98"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
