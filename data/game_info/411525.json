All items have price tags above them and when collected it subtracts the amount from your bank account shown above.\r\nOnce you\u2019ve collected all the items or the time runs out, you get the chance to read the newspaper and see the repercussions of your actions and purchase upgrades for your shopping cart. The upgrades will increase the speed or grip you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Farmer:</strong></p>\n<p>You start on the farm with a list of todo items (Harvest crops, Cook meal, etc.)</p>\n<p>You can move around the farm and perform different tasks to decrease your hunger and thirst, care for your children or harvest and sell crops. You have to keep yourself fed as well as your children in order to survive, but don\u2019t get caught up in that as you need to earn money to buy the food. You need to survive every round and deal with the natural disasters that happen around you. There are also disasters the consumer creates or you create yourself by cutting down forests etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38ae79544c4aeb078e8580c25e242f49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NextChapterGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
