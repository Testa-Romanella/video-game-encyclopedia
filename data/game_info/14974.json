Often this becomes a condition for further expansion.</p>\n<p>Games of the 4X genre usually have a very complex, detailed gameplay that takes considerable time to complete each of the four stages listed above.</p>\n<p>Grand strategy: the player rules the country or the empire, the actions of individuals or even large teams are usually not emphasized, the player acts by entire industries and armies.</p>\n<p>Real-time tactics: in games of this genre, all attention is paid to tactical actions on the battlefield - the location of units on the ground, the use of the terrain. Such games claim to reproduce the logic of real battles.</p>\n<p>Turn-Based Strategy: gameplay evolves as an alternation of turns of each player. In one turn in the game world can take many years, many units can make a maneuver, can change a lot.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Mode &quot;campaign&quot; - the game takes place on some part of the Earth, in a certain historical period.</p>\n<p>During one turn, the player can perform a number of very diverse actions: build, recruit and re-equip troops, change the location of troops, start negotiations, send a detachment of saboteurs on a mission or take part in a larger battle.</p>\n<p>Tactical mode - the army fighting in a certain territory, and the battle takes place in real time.</p>\n<h3>Rome: Total War</h3>\n<p>This is the third game of the Total War series. The player plays for one of the factions of ancient Rome in the Republic from 270 BC (defeat of the last Apennine enemies of Rome) to the 14th year (death of Octavius \u200b\u200bAugustus).</p>\n<p>Traditional gameplay for the Total War games.</p>\n<p>The strategic part of the game takes place in Europe, West Asia and North Africa. Each turn is half a year. The theme of this game - Rome, - led to a greater emphasis on the military parts of the game.</p>\n<h3>Rome: Total War - Alexander</h3>\n<p>This is the second official extension to Rome: Total War. The first extension was the Rome: Total War - Barbarion Invasion game.</p>\n<p>Unlike all other games of the Total War series, this game can be played in just one faction - Macedonia, led by Alexander the Great. There are seven factions in the game:</p>\n<p>Barbarian Factions: Scythia, Dahae, Illyria.<br />\nMacedonian Faction.<br />\nEastern Factions: Persia, India.<br />\nRebel Faction.</p>\n<p>The number of turns in the game is limited - there are only 100 of them. A series of battles must be won no less than on the \u201cmedium\u201d difficulty level in order to gain access to other battles.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2006-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T15:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfc/dfc88887160d34d7c8d3e3acdc2ac491.jpg", "website": "http://www.totalwar.com", "rating": 3.39, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 72, "owned": 1137, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 33}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 88, "suggestions_count": 463, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 88, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Creative Assembly"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
