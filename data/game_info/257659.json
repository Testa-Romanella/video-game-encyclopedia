Then you'll love 4 Coins. <br/><br/>4 Coins extends the classic gameplay with 3 simple but very effective improvements: <br/>1) More rows (8) and columns (9). <br/>2) You can play with 2,4 or 6 blocker stones. This makes the game much more interesting, since you have to change your tactic with every new game, because the board is different. <br/>3) You can play with a star field in one of the upper rows. When a player reaches the star, he can remove a coin of the opponent. This gives the gameplay even more action. <br/><br/>Features and game modes at a glance: <br/>- Beautiful 3D-grafic in a pirate style - Play with 2 people on one device <br/>- Play online against opponents from around the world <br/>- Play against one of your friends (search a friend function) <br/>- Blocker fields, star field and the improved board increases the fun <br/>- Detailed game statistics <br/>- Climb to the next level <br/>- Online highscore <br/>- Time limit <br/>- Beautiful soundscape with sounds of the sea <br/>- Playable horizontally and vertically <br/>- Always find a player online<br/>- Better user interface with high resolutions<br/><br/>No Advertisements, no gameslimit and Online-game-priority.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d90c238722f45b164e5c72253ccedea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Schreiber"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Thomas Schreiber"], "esrb_rating": null}
