BEPPUS are for players that want to play a challenging &amp; mind bending puzzle platformer where levels can be approached in different ways.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>One of our biggest take-aways was to have a flexible mindset in regards to the design direction of the game, because sometimes the direction that you intend to take for the game may not be a healthy approach to go. Our team had such a situation where we had a feature that we wanted but was avoided during playtests, so we removed that feature from the game &amp; we got a better end result.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T08:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23ea6dc01611074d2585b2359938821f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
