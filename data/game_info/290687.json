More blocks will drop from the ceiling as the platform sinks into the quicksand below. To make matters worse, the blocks are incredibly fragile, and jumping off of one will cause it to shatter instantly. Jumping on several blocks in quick succession earns you more points. Don't get crushed by a block or fall into the quicksand, or else it's game over!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf3b190c3e6b54425696799d4894e3c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bluswimmer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
