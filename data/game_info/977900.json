It is also the first time I am creating 3D art. As a result, the visuals are fairly rough at the start of the game and there are no animations until Chapter 3. The promotional images you see ARE screenshots taken from the game. Another not-so-good thing is that routing is difficult to understand. Again, this is my first attempt to make a game and I had no idea what I was doing when I started. A walkthrough .pdf file is included with the game.<br/>- volle.<h3>Synopsis:</h3><br/>One Lie is an adult visual story-based novel about a young man, his best friend, people he encounters along the way, his past and his future.<strong>Story</strong>:You and Julie (you will have a choice to change their names) have been best friends since a young age.

It breaks your heart and your trust in her. You feel betrayed. Not only is she the closest person to you she lies about you, thus using you to hurt someone.
