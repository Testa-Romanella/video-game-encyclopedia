This is a Maze of Galious-like, akin to games like La-Mulana and Hydra Castle Labyrinth, with more of a focus on the story called Mysterious Max.<br/></p>\n<p>If I ever get a source of income from something other than game development, I'll definitely return to this project. But for now it remains a prototype. Feel free to download and make your way to the end of the level where you'll fight an unfinished boss that can't be killed. If you enjoyed what little is there, I'll be happy. Hopefully some day I'll have something more substantial for you to sink your teeth into! Until then, take care.</p>\n<p>~squircle<br/><br/></p>\r\nStory (when I make the game)\r\n<p>(sorry for the old sprites)<br/></p>\n<p>You play as Max, a mysterious dog with a mysterious past.
