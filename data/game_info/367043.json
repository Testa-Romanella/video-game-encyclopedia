In the game, you will control the sword flight to collect \"aura stone\" as much as possible in the almost infinite mountains. This is also a program-generated type of game where the mountains in the game will be randomly generated in each game.<br/><br/>This is a small game that is suitable for repeated play. Your only goal in the game is to constantly break the scores you have created before.<h3>Game Features</h3><br/><br/><ul><li>Full of Xianxia style.<br/><br/></li><li>The map generated by the program.<br/><br/></li><li>Global leaderboard.<br/><br/></li><li>Steam cloud support.<br/><br/></li><li>Multi-language support.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2a1b633d60a9ee3488615b0efff3dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u68a6"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u68a6"], "esrb_rating": null}
