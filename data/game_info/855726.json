{"id": 855726, "slug": "ar-knickknack-around-the-world", "name": "AR KnickKnack - \"Around the World\"", "name_original": "AR KnickKnack - \"Around the World\"", "description": "<p>This project was made for\u00a0Project 1\u00a0of UIC's CS 428 course.</p>\n<p>AR Knickknack - \"Around the World\" is an Augmented Reality app built with the Vuforia Engine using Unity.\u00a0The app is able to take a paper cube with special patterns printed on it and overlay a souvenir-type knickknack on the camera feed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two knickknacks available, one based on Gundam Factory Yokohama in Japan and the other based on HamHamPangPang, a theme cafe in Korea based on games made by Project Moon.</p>\n<p>The first knickknack depicts a Gundam breakdancing on a pedestal while\u00a0familiar equipment rotates in a cyclone around it. Why? Partially because I thought it would be really funny, but also to see if I\u00a0could manage to get an animated object working. When the knickknack is turned upside down and flipped back up, a multicolored spotlight will turn on while \"Jellyfish Jam\" from Spongebob plays in the background.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second knickknack depicts multiple characters from the game, Lobotomy Corporation, created by Project Moon. Specifically, Gebura and Malkuth on one side, and one of the enemies, Doubt, on the other.\u00a0It's a fairly static scene until the knickknack is flipped, at which point flickering red lights and\u00a0an alert overlay will appear on the screen, while \"Second Warning\" from the game's OST begins to play. It makes for quite a unique experience, in my opinion.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Demo Video:</p>\n\n\n<p>Models shown in sidebar:</p>\n<ol><li>Gundam</li><li>Gun</li><li>Shield</li><li>Beamsaber (original)</li><li>Pedestal (original)</li><li>Gebura</li><li>Malkuth</li><li>Doubt</li><li>Sword (original)</li><li>Pen (original)</li><li>Notepad (original)</li></ol>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gundam, gun, and shield models:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gundam-rx-78-60142fe11f9d41ddb412e1b67ee855ad\r\n</p>\n<p>Doubt model:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lobotomy-corporation-green-dawn-doubt-cbba2871d31c4858bd3d5bff88b66529\r\n</p>\n<p>Gebura model:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gebura-robot-lobotomy-corporation-fc180b36f5954bf390da4eb06ce0885e\r\n</p>\n<p>Malkuth model:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lobotomy-corporation-sefirot-malkuthrobot-40832b56a4814e4fae0b985c8e11151f</p>\n<p>Jellyfish Jam audio:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWqAf4eex14&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=MikeFitzer\r\n</p>\n<p>Second Warning audio + sprite:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe3h62MrlPE&amp;ab_channel=ProjectMoonOfficial\r\n</p>\n<p>Gundam Factory Yokohama logo:\u00a0https://gundam-factory.net/images/og_gundam_factory09.jpg\r\n</p>\n<p>HamHamPangPang logo:\u00a0https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EaiTaR-UMAAEVYk.jpg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04d4d7177743080eb0182361c9bf27a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Lunarium Works"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
