It was coded and rewritten in one day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fragments of the Past was inspired by a radio script I wrote as an undergradute. Now, I've expanded on it and converted it to the IF form. This version is around 7000 words.</p>\n<p>You can choose the pronouns and name of the MC. Experience a journey of healing three years after MC\u2019s partner has died from an illness. Fulfill your partner\u2019s last bucket list item. You can choose the pronouns of the partner who has passed. This game has four characters:</p>\n<ul><li>MC</li><li>Alex - MC's partner who died</li><li>Lily - Alex's sister and MC's best friend</li><li>The Sherpa</li></ul>\n<p>Please note this is not a self-insert and very different from my other game. It is a short exploration of two character's journeys. There will be some choices, but they do not affect the ending. Therefore, this is a linear story.<br/></p>\n<p>Content warnings: grief, death, possible mature language, dangerous activities (climbing).</p>\n\n\n<p>My other interactive fiction is very different than this one and is titled Next in Line. It's a royal interactive fiction where you can form friendships or romance four characters.
