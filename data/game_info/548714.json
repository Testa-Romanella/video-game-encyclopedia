You play as a young man named Noah who has been tasked with picking up some things from his cousin\u2019s old house. You haven\u2019t been there since <em>it</em> happened. As you explore the house, you remember the things that led you here- the things you\u2019d rather not think about.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warning: This game includes mentions of transphobia, abuse, murder, and self harm.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>It is designed to be played on computers and should work fine on tablets, though it isn't formatted for phones.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who's supported me and made this project possible, whether with advice and feedback, kind words, or sharing my work around &lt;3</p>\n<p>If you want to keep up with my future projects and support my work, you can check out my dev blog.
