Now imagine it being a Platform Game.<br/><br/>Remember the last time you played a game of\u00a0<strong>Hangman</strong>? It\u2019s that pencil and paper guessing game where one player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve decide to give this concept a new twist by turning it into a Platform Game.<br/><br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>The mean St. Nicholas has stolen all the letters from all over the world so that no one could ever make a St. Nicholas poem again, and St. Nicholas doesn\u2019t have to give away his presents to greedy children. He\u2019s put all the letters in a big vault so that no one can reach them, and to open the vault you need a secret password.\r\n</p>\n<p>But what St. Nicholas didn\u2019t know is that there was a hole in his bag through which some letters have fallen onto the floor. These letters form a trail to the vault of St. Nicholas. And if you collect the correct letters from the track you might even be able to guess the password and open the vault.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our great hero Hangman 3D takes on the task of collecting these letters and to teach St. Nicholas a lesson by already take one of his presents. Help Hangman find the way to the vault and collect the right letters along the way. Also don\u2019t forget to steal a package from St. Nicholas!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T07:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2de703322f133025e6a9c56550d8b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedestal Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
