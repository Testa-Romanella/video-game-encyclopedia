{"id": 242715, "slug": "mystic-fur-defense", "name": "Mystic Fur Defense", "name_original": "Mystic Fur Defense", "description": "<p>Long ago colorful and radiant crystals were unearthed by a small mining group. The miners brought their discovery back to the kingdom for refinement. Scholars tinkered with the strange material until they discovered a strange reaction when placed near a person\u2019s dick. They crafted cockrings from the crystals and found that when wore gave their suitors magical strength and abilities. This caused the kingdom to flourish and surrounding lands to grow jealous. After years of conflict with the kingdom, the neighbors procured a small amount of the crystals for themselves. Much less adept and working too hastily they only got a few cockrings completed and created a much bigger threat, the SCAR (Slime-Corrupted Autonomous Rings), horrendous slime creatures spawned from the corrupted crystal seeking to return to its purer form. You must defend the kingdom\u2019s crystal mines from the enemy factions and their horde of SCAR with your enhanced fire, ice, and earth soldiers. If the SCAR take over the mines they will grow too powerful and decimate your troops. Successfully defend against every wave, capture the enemy leader, and remove their dark crystal cockring to defeat them. The catch is, the only way for one to be removed is by it getting fucked off. So fuck your enemies or get fucked by slime in this exciting tower defense game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/844/8446e5b84ebccc28ecd4ba2d92b36546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cypher333"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
