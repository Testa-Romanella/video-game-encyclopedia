The territories were full of huge dinosaurs and that's exactly where the adventure starts for you. <br/>Select your favorite dino and get yourself out there to acomplish your only mission: Becoming the king of the swamp. <br/>Just go across the landscape and show the other prehistoric monsters who is the one in charge. It won't be an easy path, either a short one. <br/>Remember you can't just force the other inhabitants of the swamp to respect you as their leader, you'll have to walk near them, but don't crash into them!<br/>Nobody would like that and you could just get attacked or biten by other opponent!
