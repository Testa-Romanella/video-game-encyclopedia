Hopefully that isn't you. Two roads battle to become more popular than the other. In this small game, you take control of a sentient road and build yourself up to generate enough income to destroy your competition. We made this game in 11 days as part of the 2018 CFN Game Jam. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d3358c857a4985f782ed4218b0adb52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linc7991", "odonnellnick"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
