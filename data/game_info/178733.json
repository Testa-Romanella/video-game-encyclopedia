Then<strong><em>\u00a0Endless Jewels</em></strong>\u00a0is just the game for you!</p>\n<p>Endless Jewels is a casual-puzzle game created by Alpaca Studio. Endless Jewels offers the same quality and game play experience one might find in the vast array of \"Jewel\" games. However Endless Jewels doesn't come packed with timers, coins, challenges, or \"daily rewards\". You just play as long as you wish (or until you run out of moves) and quit when your done. (If you do run out of moves you would just click the '<em>Restart'</em> button. On every restart or quit,\u00a0current score will be reset and the leaderboard will be updated accordingly. )</p><p><em><strong>Endless Jewels</strong>\u00a0Standalone</em>\u00a0for PC, Linux, and Mac is now available for free.\u00a0 Get the android\u00a0 version here:\u00a0https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlpacaStudio.EndlessJewels</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The objective of the game is to match as many jewel pairs as you can. The minimum required for a match is 3.\u00a0 Matches can be vertical or horizontal, but <em>NOT</em> diagonal. Certain jewel pairs vary in points given per jewel.\u00a0Each <em>Alpaca Jewel (\u00a0,\u00a0</em><em>\u00a0) is</em>\u00a0worth 10 points a piece, while all other jewels are worth 5 points.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0First time players may notice a 1-2 minute load time.
