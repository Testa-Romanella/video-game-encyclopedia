Another thing to note is that it is pretty short do not expect a 30 hour experience with it, that's my future projects ;)</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think about it and if you were able to complete it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Kingames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/93729b8df0e17f65f83000051e2b5078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kingames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
