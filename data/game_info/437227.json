I wanted to use games as a form of art and share the project with others.</p>\n<p>My goal was to make 3 empty but \u201cinteractive\u201d environments/spaces (voidscapes) with each their own theme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the development of this project the overall theme evolved to: \u201ca filled void\u201d, which each of the games had in common. The project began to acquire a deeper (maybe personal) meaning, despite being an experimental project at first.</p>\n<p>The first one means isolation, everything around you is chaotic emptiness.</p>\n<p>The second is filling the void on your own way and terms, others can be a big part in this.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the third is about acceptance and calm, but there will always be an endless void in the background.</p>\n<p>how to play:</p>\n<p>Mostly with just the mouse and sometimes the space bar. From time to time you need the esc button to close the application or open up the menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>hit me up if you like it :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>buh bye &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:00:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5330d678aaa8641c3519ae4b7176ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PATATJES 4 LIFE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
