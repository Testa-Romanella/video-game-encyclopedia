The knightess agrees. The king does not.</p>\n<p>The obvious solution: Sneak through the requisite dungeon to get into the castle anyway.

And not just that, her time's limited to - and so are her action. Too many inputs, and she's literally <strong>out of controls</strong> and probably on her way to fall into a pit!</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us to <strong>controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows for movement. These just initiate movement and are relative to the camera view.</p>\n<p>Space to Jump.</p>\n<p>Q/E, Left/Right ALT or mouse buttons to rotate the camera.</p>\n<p>ESCAPE to restart a level, in case you already know you won't be able to finish it.<br/></p>\n<p>Alt+F4 to quit.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>-Sprites: LuizMelo and OcO(via itch.io)<br/></p>\n<p>-Music: lifeasaghost and celestialghost8 (via opengameart)\r\n</p>\n<p>-SFX: Jerimee, owlstorm (both via freesound), janschupke (via opengameart)<br/></p>\n<p>-silly lowpoly 3D stuff/design/Levels: Me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/6610959e5564a60f03b24b8b666e560c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zefiris"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
