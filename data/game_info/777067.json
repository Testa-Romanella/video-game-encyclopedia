You must use them to protect yourself from harm and wait until you are ready to unleash your ultimate spell.\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0 Chorts are immune to magic damage but are vulnerable to the physical arrows of the elves.</p>\n<p> Skeletons are immune to physical damage but are vulnerable to spells that the mages cast. ( You can move either units by left clicking on them and right clicking inside your arena prison. )</p>\n<p> Once this hits 0 you die.</p>\n<p> Mana allows you to keep your shield up and protect your self from any incoming damage at the cost of mana per hit. As long this is up it will charge your\u00a0\u00a0ultimate spell and eventually unleash it against your enemies. You can also press the SPACEBAR to toggle the shield on/off to regenerate mana.</p><p>Your shield also gets toggled off automatically once you run out of mana. Make sure to toggle it on again (I keep forgetting) in order to continue to charge your spell.</p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Your enemies. Destroying all of them will\u00a0free yourself (you win basically and that's it.)\r\n<p>Status: Unfinished and left behind</p>\n<p>This was a failed submission for the Bullet Hell Jam 2022. I suck at time management and have a bad case of procrastination. I decided to make it playable\u00a0anyways but without a main menu and among other important things that a game should have. Oh well...</p><p>Note: It might be too hard. Hehe... or not? I really don't know I tested it only a couple of times.\u00a0</p><p>PS: Moving your minions is kinda janky. I have a lot more to learn.</p>\n<p>On the other hand this is my first game that I upload that others might play.</p>\n<p>Made with\u00a0Bevy Game Engine</p><p>The Last Necromancer Github</p>\n<p>Assets used:<br/></p>\n<p>Minion Roar\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0greg300</p>\n<p>Boom FX\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0shiru8bit</p>\n<p>Fireball\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0CodeManu</p>\n<p>Warped Shooting FX\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Ansimuz</p>\n<p>Skull icon\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Cethiel</p>\n<p>Bullet Barrage\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Cethiel</p>\n<p>Laments of the War\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Cethiel</p>\n<p>Mixed nuts\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0bluecarrot16</p>\n<p>Mana and health icons\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Kutejnikov</p>\n<p>Tileset (including enemies, minions, and players)\u00a0=&gt;\u00a00x72</p>\n<p>Dungeon font\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0vrtxrry</p>\n<p>Background\u00a0=&gt;\u00a0Brett Gregory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T11:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82d29a57f3f32101d5c02cd82ecd5e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pieroluha"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
