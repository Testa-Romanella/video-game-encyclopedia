{"id": 718452, "slug": "modworld-a-master-thesis-prototype", "name": "ModWorld: A Master Thesis Prototype", "name_original": "ModWorld: A Master Thesis Prototype", "description": "<p>Developed in Unity3D by adapting a Udemy tutorial (references below).</p>\n<p>The concept of this project was to provide in-game mod tools to the player allowing them to edit usually hidden game variables and modify the next playthrough experience. The idea was to open as many hidden variables as possible, allowing a \u201cfull\u201d modification (sometimes called an \u201coverhaul\u201d) of the game and the game playing experience. Such modifications like player created maps/levels were desired however were deemed to be too time extensive to implement. As such, the potential scope of this project was reduced to the modding tools provided which are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Modding Enemy Stat Values</li><li>Modding Boss Stat Values and Enabling/Disabling as desired</li><li>Modding World Paths/Routes and Battle timers</li><li>Modding the Player Team stat values and Enabling/Disabling Team mates as desired.</li></ul>\n\n<p>It is important to note that the project itself has had no balancing to the predefined values. When playing, please do not feel like this is the intended experience, game balance was not seen as a necessity to highlight the mod-ability of this project.</p>\n<p>Should the player ever get stuck during a run through, pressing the key: t will open the mod menu prior to the end of the level. Other keyboard shortcuts do still exist, though are irrelevant as they are remnants of the Udemy course this project used as a base. </p>\n\n<p>As there is <strong>no in-built tutorial</strong>, it is recommended that the player reads the Controls prior to playing.</p>\n\n<p><em>References:</em></p>\n<p>Doyle, J.
