After completing each 3-Stage loop, the game spawns enemies faster and their reload time gets shorter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game only stops once you deplete your hearts. You are granted invulnerability after a hit, and after receiving an extra heart.</p>\n<p>You shoot at enemies that can shoot back, and destroy enough of them to get to the next stage. Shooting enemies wrap across the screen as they travel by.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into 3 different stages.</p>\r\nGROUND STAGE\r\n<p>You are on the ground, and your shots travel at an upward angle toward flying enemies. You must jump over the short obstacles on the ground, and score enough hits to get to the next stage.</p>\r\nSKY STAGE\r\n<p>You are now flying your ostrich out in space! You can move in all directions, and your shots now move forward. Meteorites and spaceships try and take you down this time - once again, clearing enough enemies will advance you to the third and final stage.</p>\r\nBARRIER STAGE\r\n<p>A\u00a0space barrier has been erected between you and the Space Crystal, as enemy bullets are shot toward you.\u00a0Your shots will break the barrier block per block, as a timer counts down. Reach the Crystal before timer runs out to get extra points!</p>\n<p>Failing to take the Crystal in time will simply not award you any extra points.</p>\n<p>After this stage is cleared, the next loop stars, accelerating spawn rate and firing timers.</p>\r\nGame End\r\n<p>The Stages repeat and repeat endlessly as long as the player can clear each stage. After every hit from enemies or their bullets, a brief second of invincibility is granted. Once you run out of hearts, you'll be shown you final Loop and Score!</p>\r\nExtra Hearts\r\n<p>Every 1000 points, you will receive an extra heart, being able to take one more hit before a Game Over!</p>\r\nENEMY TYPES\r\nFlying Enemies\r\n<p>These include the UFOs from the Ground Stage and the Spaceships from the Sky Stage. They move across the screen, shooting bullets at you. They will wrap around the screen once they exit from the left.</p>\r\nZooming Enemies\r\n<p>These include the obstacles in the Ground Stage and the meteorites in the Sky Stage. They move across the screen faster, but do not wrap around once they exit to the left.</p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>Programming wise, this is probably my most complicated game in Pico8!\u00a0The Gameplay itself keeps changing between the different stages, each having their own little different rules and calls they have to make.</p>\n<p>It's also a good lesson on how useful it is to be able to store function calls inside variables! Most of the changing mechanics depend on that system there, afterall.</p>\n<p>Very satisfied that I started off with a more complex idea and I made it actually work!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:31:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82bc3996718c50f00246f36232d199fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
