Created for ProcJam 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea is that we first generate a simple loop track. Than we iterate over square patches of a configurable size and find the two entry tile. Now we replace the track inside the patch with a random patch connecting the two entries. This way we keep the loop intact.</p>\n<p>Assets:\u00a0Kenney \u2022 Racing Kit<br/>Code: Saduras/procjam22 (github.com)\u00a0<br/>Engine: Untity3D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T07:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689e9a776dfd0a69309565a3cdf92ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saduras"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
