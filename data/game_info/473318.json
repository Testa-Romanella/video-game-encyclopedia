He had lived a long time, and this longevity was attributed to his armor, which he never left. So he was called Yoroi.<br/>Many powers were attributed to this armor, but the greatest of them was immortality. Thus, it was the object of many desires but Yoroi had always managed to keep it until then.<br/>Unfortunately, no man is invincible, and brigands stole it from him one full moon night. They then shared the fragments of this armor, and thus its various powers.<br/>The story I have just told you took place more than a thousand years ago, and some adventurers are still trying to gather the different fragments of this armor to gain immortality.<br/>You are one of them.</p>\n\r\nControls :\r\n<p>Left and right to move</p>\n<p>Up to jump (press longer to jump higher)</p>\n<p>C to pause<br/></p>\n<p>when unlocked : space to sword</p>\n<p>when unlocked : down+space to dash<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/988995607286c3397d309506fcf15c42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["NathBo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
