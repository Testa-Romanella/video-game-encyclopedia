Players are given the option of switching between different types of football (soccer, rugby, rugby-style) and additionally the ability to score goals.\n\nI'm pretty sure that anything that looks surprisingly similar to Real Sports in the way that it works would appeal to a lot of people.\n\nThe whole thing should be in the hands of the next publisher for appropriate distribution.\n\nSource\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\nPocket</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b18b5d1fdeacde7718de7ee6429af22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
