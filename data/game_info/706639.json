In order to get out, the player must open lootboxes and find the useful items within them.  These items can then be used to attain other lootboxes in an attempt to find the elusive key which opens the factory doors and allows the player to escape the loot-filled nightmare.  Throughout their journey, the player must contend with hordes of slobbering zombie lootboxes and the maddening  redundancy of opening countless, useless, lootboxes.</p>\n\n<p>Game Created by Amir Ameri, Brendan Schofield, and Yosef Jacobson</p>\n<p>Music accredited to Dan Yan-Key, KieLoKaz, and Lobo Loco.</p>\n<p>This game was created as a class project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5aac9a35491eb9f61f5bb72afea6ade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bschofield"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
