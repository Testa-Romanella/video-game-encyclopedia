Lightbeams have no interactable features as long as they are without fog. Once in contact with fog they change their behaviour and become for example solid so you can jump on them. With this unique mechanic you have to make your way through your crashed spaceship, a dark and eerie spaceship graveyard and finally escape through a system of caves.<br/><br/>Five different lightbeams are implemented each with their own unique mechanic. Find out how they work - Find a way to use them to progress - Execute your solution with crisp controls on either Mouse&amp;Keyboard or your favorite controller.<br/><br/>We are still in development and the final goal is 10 puzzling hours of gameplay by the end of the year.Planed Features<br/><ul><li> ~10 hours of gameplay<br/></li><li> Physics puzzles in a dynamic environment<br/></li><li> Steam Workshop Implementation - Create and share your own challenges<br/></li><li> 3 major chapters each with an highly detailed graphic style<br/></li><li> Steam Trading Cards and Achievements<br/></li><li> Eastereggs and secrets - take your time to explore</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89118c31bc2c8d6cc6d71415b4b8fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Binary Impact"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Binary Impact"], "esrb_rating": null}
