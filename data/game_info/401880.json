I may revisit it at a later date when I have time.</p><p>This was an attempt to investigate limitations on input, ie, you can only move in the opposite direction from the one in which you are currently moving. Unfortunately, I didn't really have any time to\u00a0work on it\u00a0as I was moving house, so have a not-really-that-fun 'game' for posterity.</p>\n<p>The art style was going for '90s FMV, but it came out more as just Supermegablurrovision. :|</p>\n<p>Frankly, the best bit is the music, which I did in LMMS in about 2 hours. Will link to SoundCloud in a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Left / A: Move left<br/></p>\n<p>Right / D: Move right</p>\n<p>You can also use the left analogue stick on a gamepad, but you still need a mouse to click the play button. :)</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Unity has decided to re-import <em>everything</em>, so not gonna get a demo up for this before the deadline. :| Will update when it's (finally) posted. Should've done this yesterday.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT @ 19:40 CEST:</strong> Looks like the background shaders to draw the animated starfields\u00a0aren't working in the WebGL build, hence the purple background. Basically, just don't play this, it's broken, and I don't have time to fix it at the moment. :/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de1997a2beba2ca9d246e883055b541c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
