You discover that global warming has led to the collapse of human civilization.\r\n\r\nThere are no animals or plants left. Instead, it\u2019s a dry, barren world inhabited by terrestrial species on the brink of war.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith the opportunity to turn back time, can you reverse the effects of climate change and prevent intergalactic war?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n\n<p>Genre: visual novel, point and click adventure, educational, trivia, story-based\r\n</p>\n<p>\tPlaytime:&lt;1 hour</p>\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n<p>BROWSER GAME: Click on black screen to play.\u00a0For some computers, the title screen might take longer to load (will appear black at first).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0After clicking on the menu icon, a separate screen appears with the options to save, load, hide message, skip message, and return to title.     There is a \"back button\" on the top right, however, it is still a bit finnicky. You will most likely have to click around the perimeter of it/click more towards the bottom for it to work.
