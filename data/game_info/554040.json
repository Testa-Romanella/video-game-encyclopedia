Roe must subject themselves to the terrors of the unknown as they traverse through rot and darkness to find what\u2019s rightfully theirs. Something lurks in the shadows and it\u2019s got an insatiable appetite. Use Roe\u2019s flashlight to illuminate nearby surroundings, solve puzzles, and fend off unwanted company. Don\u2019t depend on the torch for too long though, it\u2019s battery life is fickle.
