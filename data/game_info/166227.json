When the three days are up, the doors unlock and you're free to go. Until then survival is up to you.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGame:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach 'day' is five minutes of real time, so after fifteen minutes if you're still alive you automatically win the game, no matter if you just stood in one spot for fifteen minutes or spent your time crafting a trap base worthy of the vampire slaying gods.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Combat:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou're given a baseball bat at the start, but that's the only weapon you'll get. So pair that with a bunch of deadly traps if you hope to survive.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t - Traps:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTraps come in six varieties and are as follows: Bear Traps, Flammable Tar, Shock Pool, Holy Cross, Spinning Blade, and RC Car. Bear traps and bottles of flammable tar must be found, but the rest are crafted from parts found in the warehouse.\r\n</p><p>- Crafting:</p><p>Each trap (aside from the bear trap and flammable tar) requires certain parts to be crafted which are listed under the respective trap on the inventory. Upon collecting the parts, click the button next to the trap to craft it, then hit the corresponding number key to equip it in-game.</p><p>\r\n\tControls (WIP):\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWASD - Movement\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHold Shift - Sprint\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSpace - Attack\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTab - Inventory/Crafting Screen\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t1-6 - Equip Traps\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tZ, C- Zoom Camera Out/In\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tF - Place/reset trap\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tQ - Throw match\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tR - Bandage yourself\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEscape - This kills the game.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>THE FOLLOWING IS FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO RUIN THE EXPERIENCE FOR THEMSELVES:</strong> </p><p>Click here to ruin everything forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a7a625b6d74449a3f83c1c90753a96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["onimu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
