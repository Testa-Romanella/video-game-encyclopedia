There, she would begin a new life with a new identity while following the instructions given my her Master. <br/></p>\n<p>Wearing her recently bought pointy hat, on her way to joining the Adventurers' Guild, she bumped into a boy with cat ears, native to those lands. Maybe she would have experienced love at first sight, if not for the fact that, as she a little too late realized, her coin pouch was nowhere to be seen \u2014 and the culprit, the cat boy from earlier. That was only the beginning of her troubles, however, as her unwillingness to cope such unfairness let to a small chaos inside the Guild's hall, both tied up to chairs and blackmailed into paying an unreasonable sum in order not to be reported to the authorities.</p>\n<p>With no other choice, Lianna was forced to team up with the sneaky boy with feline traits, as well as noble Paladin with an angel-like smile but sadistic tendencies later on, in order to reach something resembling financial stability in that world where things hardly ever went as planned.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d8922b0b590ee65635e49637f289c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tiagox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
