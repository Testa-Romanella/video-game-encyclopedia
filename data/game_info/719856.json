It simulates conversations I\u00a0have had and wish I could have had with both others and myself. Simple and minimal, it is meant to be played slowly and repetitively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game saw many different narratives before settling on this one that is part memory and part fiction. The conversation displayed is a collage of conversations from the past and future, real and hoped for.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Play by clicking through the conversation options. This can be played in your browser. Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T04:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb4b078e0472eead51333d364f6fc72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Claire Preston"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
