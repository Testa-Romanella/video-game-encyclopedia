Unlike a regular match-3,  blocks won't disappear the moment you match them. Instead, you have a set number of moves to match as many blocks at once as you can. When you're happy with your matches (or you've run out of moves) end your turn to remove all matched blocks simultaneously. When your next turn beings, a new set of blocks will fall in to replenish your supply. Should the stack of blocks ever reach the top row, it's game over.<br/><br/>- Endless arcade mode. See how high you can score!<br/>- Compatible with keyboards and PS4/Xbox 360/Xbox One controllers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79ee81a14d829181cf561c0d8f25f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Disc 1"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["DISC 1"], "esrb_rating": null}
