Through the process of elimination and the help of some very generous volunteers, you must establish which pills are poisonous and which pills are safe. <br/><br/><br/><br/>If a volunteer dies when they take a pill, you know that at least one of the colours on it was poisonous. If they survive, you know that all the colours on that pill are safe. But now that pill is gone. <br/><br/><br/>If you think all the pills that remain are poisoned, hit the panic button. But only if you\u2019re certain, because if you are wrong, it\u2019s game over. <br/><br/><br/>Once you've decided a pill is safe, you must consume it. If it doesn\u2019t kill you, you proceed to the next round, which will be slightly harder. How many rounds can you survive? The less casualties you cause, and the longer you survive, the better your score.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T05:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cacdf0e85f9f106136df733e87e910e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
