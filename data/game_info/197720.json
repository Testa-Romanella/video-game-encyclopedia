Essentially I rewrote an old Pygame project of mine, Juggleball, in Unity.</p><p>It now has touch support and BALLS WITH GOOGLY EYES! Googly eyes make everything better! Also, multiple game modes, achievements, leaderboards, and all that good stuff.</p><p>The game is 100% free and open source! Check out the entire Unity project on GitHub, released under CC Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International. That means you can reuse any of my stuff as long as you say I was the original creator, and don't make any money off it!</p><p>The game is available for free with no in app purchases on the App Store and Google Play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a42bd79622a4d13e2f2bd9acb1b1fbd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jellyberg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
