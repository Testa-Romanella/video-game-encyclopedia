Now the air in the city is filled with nuclear radiation. You and your partners will play the role of survivors after the war and survive in the shelter house.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a city destroyed by war. Keeping healthy, finding supplies, and avoiding death are challenges to you.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, each person has 5 health points and 5 stamina points and can choose their character card. The character card is very important in the game. Each card has its unique function.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Because this city is filled with nuclear radiation, every day you will lose one health point because of radiation. And every day you need to take risks of spending one stamina point to find food and materials. Of course, you can choose to synthesize or use it directly. Forgot to mention, all materials are shared!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a terrible environment. Everyone needs to help each other in a critical moment. If a player\u2019s heart point or stamina point drops below 2, teammates can help him or her.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Every day is a new challenge. At the beginning of each round, you need to draw a random event card, which represents what you will encounter on this day. If unfortunately, there is a violent storm on this day, then you will be exhausted and all of you will lose one stamina point. Sometimes there will even be special events. Of course, if you make corresponding equipment to deal with the event at this time, you will get additional rewards. In contrast, good things happen in the city, which can help you survive better.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>After 14 days, a rescue helicopter will pass over the city. You need to collect all the signal transmitter parts to call for rescue, or you will be trapped here until you die.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Please ensure that you have sufficient health and stamina points to explore and complete the signal transmitter so that you will win!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is our game, Fourteen Days, TRY NOT TO DIE! City signals.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/481832aa223ebfbc45f6355d05d00144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shen_Martin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
