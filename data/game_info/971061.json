Explore the levels while the beasts of another dimension go after you. Find all the map pieces to exit the level and destroy every creature in your path.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the box spawner, a bizarre device that puts and stacks boxes below you. Maneuver enemies by blocking their path, forget about jet packs and traverse the map by building tall box towers that will annoy friends and foes! Get creative and throw the boxes, kill enemies to refill or wait for them to replenish on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as one of 4 friends, with zero character development. No dialogs or mediocre subtitle acting. Perfect for those who skip cutscenes! (none included). So bring your friends together! if you have any, and play a couch coop local session, no split screen with them. Gamepad required.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy more than 45 levels filled with erratic enemies made by hand by the best non-organic pizza-powered free grazing indie craftmen. With hundreds and hundreds of little details and just a few locations such as: city by day, city by night, forests, sewers, caves, train stations, more city, mountains, highway, suburbs and cyberpunk I think.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T03:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f905e366a8da707502ac3c51c38bd2.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/chuckymikeadv/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["War Industries Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["War Industries Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
