But this is no ordinary watch... this watch allows you to travel through time! However, there is a catch: the more you use it to freeze time around you, the more time passes for you. After a little use, you quickly notice how much you've aged. And, in no time at all you will be older than your grandma.</p>\n<p>To remedy this situation, without giving up the great power of the watch, you decide to go after one of the most famous treasures of all, the Fountain of Youth -- for only that will allow you to use the watch without consequence. You make your way to the black market and buy an old treasure map from a shifty-eyed man. He explains that the map leads to a place far away from here that the locals call \"Time Mountain\". At the top is rumored to be the Fountain of Youth.</p>\n<p>Upon seeing your excitement at hearing this, he calmly warns you, \"Those who wish to cheat Death, must meet Death.\"</p>\n<p>Only slightly unnerved, you depart at once. Soon after departing the dark lit alleyways of the black market, you feel a presence following you. You check your shoulder twice but see no one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You set out for Time Mountain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/880f813db2e14321d929b61aa0b9b5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gabbydelforge"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
