You are a lone mechanic on a space station that is falling apart. With every step you take the tile behind you will fall, so plan your path carefully or get sucked into the void!</p>\n<p>Astral Escape is a tile based puzzle game set in a sci-fi space station. You need to push the generators into the right spots for the doors to open while you can't walk on the same tile twice. Can you make it to the escape pod?</p>\n<p>Since the game is set in space, there are no sounds atm, but feel free to put on some lofi beats in the background ^^</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move and control to reset the level!</p>\n\n\n<p>There may be some updates in the future, but for now I'll keep it as is. But still, feel free to leave comments with questions or bugs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45a6938618ae08b9b212470d5b4792df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chouchourd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
