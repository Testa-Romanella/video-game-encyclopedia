From time to time, a developer hosted mega-game is held on live multiplayer servers. Although the players can battle on different planets in one galaxy, there is no space combat present in the game. Instead, the game focuses on land and naval combat. </p>\n<p>It is possible to use the planet&#39;s moons as army carriers, and gravity plays an important role in the gameplay as it can be used to damage the enemy army. Players take control of a Commander. Commanders are strong units and essential units in the game. They can only build base buildings without any specialization. If the Commander gets killed, the player loses the match. The faction&#39;s Commanders do not differ in their abilities or gameplay, yet they feature a distinct visual style.</p>\n<p>There is no singleplayer campaign present in the game, yet it is possible to play offline with the help of AI bots.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-14T07:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/656d684bd6728e09cb121ad7563b146b.jpg", "website": "http://www.planetaryannihilation.com", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 77, "owned": 1401, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 52, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 431, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 93, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Uber Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Uber Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
