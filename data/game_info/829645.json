She finds herself in a terrifying forest glen, isolated and alone.<br/></p>\n<p>In this classic point and click adventure, you must guide Max as she gathers items and information in her quest to return to the real world.\u00a0</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Point and click with your mouse. Watch the cursor to get hints about areas that can be interacted with.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made in a week for the <strong>Horror Jam - Isolation</strong>. The theme made me think about the Upside Down and what a creepy place it would be to enter by yourself.</p>\n<p>This is a fan game and is in no way supported or endorsed by Netflix or the makers of Stranger Things. I just love that show so much, I've always dreamt of doing a fan game for it. I hope the project shows that I'm deeply in love with the world and characters. I tried to do them\u00a0justice!</p>\n<ul><li>DESIGN, CODING, VIDEO EDITING - HugBug</li><li>BACKGROUNDS and CLIPS - Taken from the show.
