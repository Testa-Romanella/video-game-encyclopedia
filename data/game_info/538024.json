The goal is to keep the sloth alive by eating algae at a faster rate than his body loses energy, while avoiding predation by an alligator during 333 seconds of fun\u00a0gameplay.\u00a0The gator's behavior changes over time\u00a0until he goes nuts and flies ... whaaaat? I know, real gators don't fly but ours\u00a0is fun and we hope it makes you laugh.</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0\u00a0is\u00a0a parent-child team project\u00a0inspired on <em>Thalassocnus</em> spp., a group of semi-aquatic sloths that existed millions of years ago in\u00a0 what is now South America.\u00a0The game is the first of a series themed on the interactions between herbivores, carnivores, plants, and energy, illustrating how herbivores balance grazing with escaping from predators (carnivores) and how such balance affects their net energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please enjoy it and give us your feedback!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/593/59327bbc43ad8b70076b5acb78962b06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dagovenera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
