The theme for this jam was holes, so naturally I looked into how I\u00a0could twist the meaning of the word. A \"hole\" can refer to a \"Small or unpleasant place.\" Going off of this, I decided to make a game about bringing light to a world, or a \"hole,\" where there is none. Initially, it was inspired from some personal experiences, but as I created more of the game I realized that it was a story that many different people could relate to instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click to move</p>\n<p>A/D: Pan the camera</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>Move into the monuments and avoid the spheres. The monuments are the obelisk-like structures with beams of light emitting from them.\u00a0Every time you touch a monument, you increase your Luminence by 1. Reaching a Luminence of 20 causes you to win. The spheres are \"voids,\" which will kill you upon touch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/431f35d638b94ba0a2af0e6fa0b6cbc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Umbra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
