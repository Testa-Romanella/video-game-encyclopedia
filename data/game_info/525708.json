I started creating the game for my then 4 year old son, a pirate fanatic who was just beginning to learn to play simple games on our touch devices. I wanted a game for him that would exercise his mind, have simple controls, and recreate some of the pure, elemental fun I saw him having as he played with his pirate ships in the bathtub. He and his little brother have been excellent co-designers and play-testers!<br/><br/>I hope you and your little pirate have fun playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T03:59:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/85481003510fee01521287e9f13469ef_jnegj91.jpg", "website": "https://bubblebeard.app/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Hein"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael Hein"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
