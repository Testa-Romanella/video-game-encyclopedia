For those new to the project, this game is intended as a strict feature clone of the original <strong>Master of Orion </strong>game from 1993. Standard disclaimers are that this is an alpha and that you are the testers. This means that not all features are present and also that you will find bugs.</p>\n<p>Join the discussion in our growing subreddit at: www.reddit.com/r/rotp</p>\n<p>It is my hope that the game is playable and enjoyable and that bugs \r\nwill be resolved quickly. This Alpha 4 release will iterate through \r\nseveral fixes and minor enhancements, and remain publicly available up \r\nuntil about two weeks before Alpha 5 is released. Although saved games \r\nfor previous alphas are no longer compatible, I will make every attempt \r\nto not break saved games for this version. However, I cannot guarantee \r\nthat since there\u2019s always some chance that a critical bug will appear \r\nthat requires a change that breaks saves.</p>\r\nWhat\u2019s changed since Alpha 3\r\n<p><strong>The Mrrshan race</strong> \u2013 Added to the game. This is mostly\r\n artwork and writing. It takes over three months to create the current \r\nset of artwork for a race since there is very little artistic overlap \r\nbetween the races. The purpose of this is to create a unique feel for \r\neach race. The same approach is taken with the writing as each race \r\ncurrently has a unique introductory background and advisor text.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More languages</strong> \u2013 The base game is in English, but we\r\n also have \u201cfull\u201d translations for German, Greek and Polish, and partial\r\n translations for French and Spanish. There is also a Hungarian and \r\nRussian translation in work. The \u201cfull\u201d translations may be missing some\r\n translations for user interfaces that have not been redesigned yet: \r\nShip Design, Map, Sabotage, Races, Credits and Galactic Council.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional UI redesign</strong> \u2013 the following user \r\ninterfaces have had their graphical redesign completed: Load/Save Game, \r\nSetup Race, Setup Galaxy and Tech. We are now at the point where over \r\nhalf of the user interfaces have been redesigned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Ship Combat UI</strong> \u2013 the previous Alpha had a very \r\nbasic user interface for ship combat that simply showed combat results. \r\nThis has been replaced with an early version of the UI that will \r\neventually be used for tactical combat. Players will now have the \r\nability to watch their ships fight if they like, although all of the \r\ngraphical effects and ship icons are placeholders. However, players will\r\n now have the ability to choose whether they want to retreat ships from \r\ncombat instead of letting the AI decide for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More efficient data structures</strong> \u2013 The huge \r\nperformance improvements made in Alpha 3 laid bare a lot of \r\ninefficiencies with some underlying data structures that the game used \r\nto represent things like ship fleets and star systems. These structures \r\nhave been drastically overhauled in order to allow the game to use \r\nmemory more efficiently. It is reasonable to believe that these changes \r\nintroduced ugly bugs that will need to be fixed, and some of these may \r\nbreak saves. These are precisely the kinds of things we need to fix in \r\nAlphas!</p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding Alpha 3 bugs</strong> \u2013 I believe that most \r\noutstanding Alpha 3 bugs are fixed, although two found very recently (a \r\ncloning bug and one regarding ship maintenance cost) were not \r\nreproduceable because of my inability to properly recreate an Alpha 3.20\r\n development build to work with the saved game files I was given. This \r\nis totally my fault and I hope that these bugs can be found again in \r\nAlpha 4 so that I can fix them.</p>\n<p><strong>User preferences retained</strong> \u2013 A minor change, but user\r\n settings for things like Sound, Music, Language, etc will be remembered\r\n each time you start the game.</p>\r\nGeneral Information\r\n<p><strong>Remnants of the Precursors</strong> is delivered as an executable Java file designed to be playable on any <em>Windows</em>,\r\n<em> Mac</em> or <em>Linux</em> PC. It will run on systems as small as a Raspberry Pi \r\nZero with 512Mb. It is a Java application, so<strong> you must have Java\r\n 8 </strong>installed on your system.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to create a special folder in which to keep the \r\ngame. Once you have downloaded it (the <em>Remnants.jar</em> file), simply \r\n<strong>double-click on the file </strong>to start it with Java. If for some reason you\u00a0 want or need to start the game from the command line, you can type:</p>\n<p><em>java -jar Remnants.jar</em></p>\n<p>All saved game files will be stored in that same directory and have the *.rotp suffix.</p>\n<p>There are two special files you may see in this directory:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Remnants.cfg</strong> \u2013 this file keeps the configuration \r\nsettings. It is a text file and safe to view, but please do not manually\r\n change the values as this might create unexpected behavior in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>recent.rotp</strong> \u2013 this is the saved game file that Remnants\r\n uses to keep track of the current game being played. Every time you hit\r\n \u201cNext Turn\u201d, this file is updated immediately and then again after the \r\ngame has finished playing the turn. If any bugs occur during the Next \r\nTurn, this is the file I will need to debug the problem!</p>\r\nHow to Test\r\n<p>In general, just play the game and have fun. There is a \u201cDifficulty\u201d \r\nsetting on the Setup screen that you can set to \u201cAI\u201d. If you do so, then\r\n the AI will play most of the game for you. You will occasionally have \r\nsome input, but not a lot. This is a good way to play a lot of turns \r\nvery quickly, but it\u2019s not very fun!</p>\n<p>If the game gets an error, you will generally see a very basic screen\r\n with text explaining what to do. Generally, you would just take a \r\nscreenshot of the text and email it to me along with the recent.rotp \r\nfile (grab it right away!).</p>\n<p>If you see something weird that\u2019s not a crash, send me a screenshot \r\nand the recent.rotp file. If this error is during the Next Turn, make \r\nsure you close the game WITHOUT finishing the turn in order to keep the \r\nrecent.rotp from being updated at the end of the turn.</p>\n<p>I know I also say this a lot, but remember that the Remnants subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/rotp)\r\n is where I am trying to centralize discussion about the game as much as\r\n possible. This makes it a lot easier for me to see and respond to bugs \r\nand questions since it\u2019s all in the same place. If you subscribe to the \r\nreddit, you\u2019ll see it in your reddit feed as well.</p>\r\nWhat\u2019s coming in Alpha 5\r\n<p>This is the tentative feature set for the next Alpha. There is no \r\nscheduled date currently since I need to get a feel first for how much \r\ntime the artwork will require. If I had to guess? March-April 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Turn-based Ship Combat</strong> \u2013 players will be able to tactically control their ships in turn-based combat</p>\n<p><strong>Ground Combat Death animations</strong> \u2013 when soldiers die, you\u2019ll see it. This was originally planned for Alpha 3 but pushed back due to schedule constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional User Interface redesigns</strong> \u2013 planned for \r\nthe next alpha are the Ship Design, Map, and Galactic Council UI. Maybe \r\nanother if time permits. Ship Design was planned for Alpha 3 but also \r\npushed back due to schedule constraints.</p>\n<p>Thanks again and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/07980af664a4aabc4cdc02f5d92b0620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ray Fowler"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
