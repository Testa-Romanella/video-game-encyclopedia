{"id": 308119, "slug": "old-edge-ii", "name": "Old Edge II", "name_original": "Old Edge II", "description": "Old Edge II - is the second part of that hardcore platformer about the lithic age where you will have to do lots of levels playing as an ancient man. As you know, in ancient times people didn\u2019t use to go out anywhere without gun. That\u2019s why in this part you have to collect all guns on the map to do next level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the second part you are going to do more difficult levels than in the first part: because of new monsters and traps you will be excited. After collecting all things you will see a door to do a new level. And, as always, be very attentive and careful; think of your every step. Only this way you will easily play the game to the end.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/246/246de381273437e44dd6e16b5096a25e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LTrust"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LTrust"], "esrb_rating": null}
