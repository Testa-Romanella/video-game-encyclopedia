What was there last time you looked may not bit there anymore the second time you check for it.<br/></p>\n<p>It's\u00a0better experienced\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0<strong>seated\u00a0experience.</strong> You will need a bit of space though.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The goal was more to provide a dreamy feeling than an escape game</strong> per se. The 3 \"puzzles\" are a bit like 90's point and click, don't look for too much logic in them. ;)</p>\n<p><strong>Expected Playtime: </strong>5 - 10mn<br/></p>\n<p>It's the last of multiple fragments exploring simple and short concepts in virtual reality.</p>\n<p>My goal was to be able to release game-jam-like (maximum 2-3 days of development) short experiments for a few weeks. This one took around 15 hours to make.</p>\n<p><em>I hope you will enjoy it!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can find other fragments here!</strong></p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n\n<p>3D assets: What Remains of Edith Finch free assets<br/>Key Prop:\u00a0 https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/old-key-3ds/448201<br/>Music: Nebular Focus - Dan Henig<br/>VFX: Particles and Wind Control System<br/>SFX: Imphenzi Universal Sound FX<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72dc2adb597db1f8d70711a9854f2246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llnaej"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
