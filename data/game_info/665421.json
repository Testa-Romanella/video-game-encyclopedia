In this universe, there are 6 possible endings, each on varying on different levels of fortune, depending on social and ethnic determinants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0a satire, written\u00a0to emphasize the lengths society will go to to antagonize women in mainstream media. Although grim, the storyline is meant to emulate the lives of women who continue to experience these violent ends daily. The game is meant to provide insight to those who do not identify as women and to provide perspective on how certain combinations of choices and identity traits could be fatal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><em>: the gender injustices that can happen throughout the story include those of intersectional feminism, partner violence, stalking, sexual and physical assault, blackmail, and murder.</em><br/><br/><strong>Spoiler Warning:\u00a0</strong>The worse endings are often produced when the player chooses routes that flag them as women of colour, queer, low socioeconomic individuals, and confrontational. The better endings favour those who identify as White, rich, cis-gendered, straight, and complicit in the face of violation.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Ending screens are written in the format of a news article that reports what happened on July 5th, usually victim-blaming women for the crimes of their attackers.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/4674fbd797367073a400233f5a13f110.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brickwalled"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
