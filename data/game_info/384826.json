In the game, you go to school for five days in a row, with the goal being to make it into class. The problem is, the hallway is full of students. Every time you bump into another student, it raises your anxiety by a little bit. Once your anxiety reaches a certain point, you will have a tic. Based on the amount of tics you have throughout the week will affect how the other classmates treat you, along with how you feel at the end of the week.\u00a0 I chose this topic because I feel it is really underrepresented in media today, and it is very important to me.<br/></p>\n<p>I really enjoyed modelling this game and creating assets. Building the school was super fun, and making the animations for the different objects I enjoyed as well. The hardest part for me was figuring out Unity's physics system. There were LOTS of physics bugs when I made the first prototype of this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/40144b3fae06e97d6ae4b8491b3dabdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["isaacwirth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
