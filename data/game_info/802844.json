All of the interactable stuff and game mechanics were all me, after college I\u2019m going to university to continue programming. During this project I learnt a whole lot to do with blueprints which allowed me to make a successful game. As well I also did some environmental design in that I placed all of the actors edited the environment I sourced to create a good area for play.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Dylan, 18 \u2013 During the production of Revolution Robotics I was the primary 3D Artist, I modelled, rigged, animated, working on this project was a very valuable experience for me as it allowed me to know what it feels like to work on a real game, it was also a great chance to experiment some techniques in my modelling. After college I\u2019m going to university to do a modelling and animation course. Whilst I\u2019m focusing on my 3D Skills I do love every aspect of game design and like any game development student my dream is to one day have an indie studio of my own</p><p>Daniel - *Details to be written*</p>Tools\r\n<p>Unreal Engine 4 - Game Engine</p>\n<p>Maya - Modelling</p>\n<p>3D Coat - Texturing of 3D Models</p>\n<p>Epic Games Store - The Map</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c38cb285f35ec8b95c7c75e3315ad13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astarrix :)"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
