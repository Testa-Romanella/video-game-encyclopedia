At least, an early alpha version of it.</p>\n<p>Refining the concept some more! I think i'm STARTING to get it but let me know what you think about it.</p>\n<p>Your house (shipping crate) has a bed in it. Sleep in it to save your game and advance time. If it's still early in the day, it'll skip to later on, otherwise it'll skip to 6 AM the next day.</p>\n<p>If you get stuck somewhere, press F5 to reset to where you last entered it. Shift+F5 also resets the whole game; that's the only way to get back to the main menu at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/112893df9d2db8826cace9bcac68e331.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giik"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
