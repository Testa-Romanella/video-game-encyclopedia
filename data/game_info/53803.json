The game was released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii U in 2014.<br />\nIn Duck Hunt, players use the NES Zapper to shoot ducks that appear on the television screen. The ducks appear one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. The player receives points upon shooting each duck. If the player shoots the required number of ducks in a single round, the player will advance to the next round; otherwise, the player will receive a game over.<br />\nThe game initially received few reviews, but was given mild critical praise and elicited a positive gamer reaction. Prior to the NES version, Nintendo also made a Duck Hunt game based on Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976. It was later a pack-in game, paired with Super Mario Bros.; the pack later also included World Class Track Meet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T11:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33e9f79f78d1d49e7631d82c59ed32a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 98, "beaten": 130, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 131, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 179, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 181, "platforms": ["Wii U", "NES"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
