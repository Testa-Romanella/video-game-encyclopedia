My aim was to make a short game in about a week. This didn't happen.<br/></p>\n<p>When I made this game, my main focus was Mechanics as metaphor, or the use of mechanics and gameplay alone to tell a story. I hope players will make interesting choices and that they really think about what their actions mean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>**Stability warning!**</p>\n<p>This game is not incredibly stable. I have worked hard on it, but I fear that I didn't quite smooth everything out as much as I could. if you experience a crash or soft-lock while playing,\u00a0 note it down in the comments, as well as what you were doing and what you suspect caused it. I will try to iron it out the best I can. from the few tests, I have done the game is pretty stable and should hold out until the end of the game. Thank you for any assistance in finding bugs!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T09:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d3004fdd57055bd19e4e0e883eebbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THE GREAT GATSBY"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
