You have 2 minutes to complete the mission. Improve your time, and get better on every next round. Good luck, and have fun! <br/></p>\n<p>Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/SBqRUA2B<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/8131c8f0166c71f2b2e1417c509a34ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["breakthegame"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
