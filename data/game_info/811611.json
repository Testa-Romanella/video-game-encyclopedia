I just want to say that we understand that, and we didn't want to do that and we even had different models for the characters and music and sounds, but there were some problems during development, that's why the game looks like a garbage. We will do our best not to make these mistakes next time!</p><p>You are a vampire who can't live without blood and you lost your blood eery second!
