We plan to eventually release this on android, and, if we had the funds, IOS. Hope you enjoy the game.\u00a0</p><p>Our website is http://hackjob.games\u00a0</p><p>Contact us at contact@hackjob.games</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Simply click and drag the mouse to move the potato, kind of like a golf game. The goal is to get to the exposed dirt. There are two mechanics you can use to help you. The slider in the lower left will control the spin of the potato. Trying to hit the potato in mid air will use slow down to get an accurate mid-air shot.\u00a0All feedback is appreciated. This game is in the very early stages of development, and we aren't very experienced and don't have a ton of free time, but we love making games, so we will continue to make updates when possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04d5404f55387c736a70958649dedb0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HackjobGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
