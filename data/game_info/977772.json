This is a free to play game, with in-app purchases like skins, dress-ups that do not affect the gameplay balance. <br/><br/><h3>Board Party Game with Suspenses</h3>A board game like no other! 15 different panel effects, random effects and events make every game full of suspense and unpredictability. With the roll of dice, you always have chances to turn the tables at the last minute.<br/><br/><h3>Over 10 Cute Anime Girls</h3>This is an exciting dicing battle with vivid Characters, each with unique skills and beautiful illustration. 10 characters are available as the game launches, and will have more as updates add.<h3>4-Person Online Matches or Single Play with AI</h3>Play how you want. Astral Party allows 1 to 4 players to compete online, or single-person play with AI. It's all the same friendship ruining fun.<h3>Dices &amp; Cards &amp; Battles &amp; More</h3>The crux of Astral Party lies in its one-on-one dice-based combat system, with a myriad of cards, effects, skill, events, and more. Card plays can augment your attack, and the dice decides if it is dodged. Every attack is like a small gamble, and nothing is more chilling than the moment you presume victory is within your grasp.<br/><br/><h3>Monsters Spice Up the Game More</h3>As the game advances, monsters will surface on the board, some attacking players and others merely stealing coins. In the end, a formidable Boss will appear and relentlessly target the richest player. If it is you, be wary of other players\u2019 \"backstabs\". (PS: Try beat the Boss to find out if there is reward dropping)<br/><br/><h3>Victory Condition</h3>Players rake in some coins to level up, and the first player hitting level 3 becomes the victor. Be quick to turn those shiny coins into levels, cause you never know if you are still rich in the next turn.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622000/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T14:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5ab072cb9b84484605df675a9d7a74d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 11, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["STAR ENGINE PROJECT"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Neverland Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
