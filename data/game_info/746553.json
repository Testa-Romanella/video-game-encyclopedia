It's your job to sell as many VR headsets to these people as possible to keep your business going, and hopefully, you can make a profit as well. This escape into the virtual world could be seen as a luxury item or as a way to live in a better false reality, but either way, you could probably make a buck off of it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In this game, manage the amount of your software and hardware to increase sales while maintaining and growing the number of servers you have, so that you can sell to more users. Buy advertisements as well to influence whether a consumer will buy your product. As your product sells, the consumers will let you know what they wish was better. Try to keep your business going over a week-long period, and hopefully, you won't go bankrupt.\r\n</p><p>How To Play:</p><p>The player needs to balance buying resources with maintaining a user base.</p><p>At the beginning of each day you purchase resources. The order in the panel (top to bottom) is software, hardware, servers, and ads:</p><ul><li>Each potential user needs hardware and has to be refilled daily, potential users collectively use software but it still needs to be refilled daily.\u00a0</li><li>The servers are very buggy at the moment and I wouldn't recommend modifying it. Each server can only hold a certain amount of people but only need to be bought once.\u00a0</li><li>Ads are bought daily and increase the chance of potential users' willingness to buy.</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for playing the game and feel free to post screenshots of your highscores!\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmer and Game Designer - Garett Anderson (@garettanderson_)\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX - Jonathan Dearman (@jonnydeboy)</p>\n<p>Art and Assets - Ammaar (@Cyclespx)<br/></p>\n<p>Shoutout to Alex Aristizabal and also\u00a0@eeshantunes!</p><p>Additional Gameplay Notes:<br/></p><ul><li>Highscore is determined by money and user base at the end</li><li>The game lasts up to 16 days or when bankrupt</li><li>The city's happiness range changes daily, but potential users also have a happiness amount within a certain range of the city's</li></ul><p>Potential Improvements Moving Forward:</p><ul><li>Better lighting</li><li>Fixing servers and adding capacity feedback</li><li>Better economy balance</li><li>Database of high scores from all players</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:28:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d13fdb4ce676c18481cf6e558c45e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kalydoscope", "Cycles3g53"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
