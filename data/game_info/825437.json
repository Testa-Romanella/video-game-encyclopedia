As part of your training, you are now placed in the proving grounds, where you must build a planet from the random debris floating in space, and protect it while life arises and evolves. The longer that life on your planet lives, the more it will evolve, and at some point, your planet's inhabitants will learn to defend themselves. But beware - the proving grounds are home to hostile alien life, and your planet will need your help every step of the way, until it finally ascends into the cosmos. And when that happens, a few will be left behind... and the cycle of evolution begins again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9ffe89edd99b6f6f11e247ade6c0ec24.jpg", "website": "http://www.strangelabs.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Strange Labs"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Strange Labs"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
