Coincidentally 2 years ago I was fortunate enough to participate in the Cat Lady Private Beta, I downloaded it on my mac and made a backup since I knew it was going away and I loved the game. I now own the full-ish version on steam but the project got cancelled. I think it's such a shame that such a great game was cancelled. I hope that if I release the private beta there will be new hype in this game and the project might be rebooted. This is mac only though since I downloaded it on my mac at a debate tournament.\u00a0I don't know if I\u00a0also backed it up on my computer, I'll check later and hopefully upload that too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec8/ec88cb46721742997b514c25c2448200.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Chocapic360"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
