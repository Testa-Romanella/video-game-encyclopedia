The emotion our group chose was \u201cHurt\u201d. Our game has the player taking control of a mother hen on a farm, trying to defend a clutch of chicks from encroaching hawks.\u00a0The player needs to lead the chicks around a farmstead, using shelter as cover from attacks, to find food for her chicks. If the chicks are fed enough during the day, they survive the night. If not, they die during the night.\u00a0For Hatching Misery we wanted to subvert the players expectations by creating a cartoony, kids game, aesthetic. By that I mean bright saturated colours, simple shapes, and bright happy music. Then when the player loses their first chick, and hears the scream, they\u2019ll realise what kind of game they\u2019re playing.\u00a0We have also set up the soundtrack so it phases between different versions of itself depending on how many chicks are left. Making a transition into sadder and sadder tones as the player fails the chicks and lets them die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:41:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed382dd3bc6380e83b21ead6d8fafa1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MurphyDoyle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
