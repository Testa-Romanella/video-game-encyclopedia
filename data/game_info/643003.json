The wind passes in front of your face, the sounds of the helicopter are like music to your ears.<br/>It's time. You jump. A great landscape awaits you below. As the air rushes past you at breakneck speed, you try to keep your balance. Will it be enough this time? You break through a cloud cover. The trees are getting closer and closer. You are waiting for the right moment. Now! You pull your parachute and shortly afterwards you feel solid ground under your feet. A new high score appears. It was enough. A moment later, and you would only have become a forgotten line on the landscape, like many comrades before you.</p>\n<p><em>Sky Dive</em> was developed as a student project at the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg GMBH.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T09:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e938b2dd6e001ee5b35b1679e6e3a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pigeon Protocol", "Ghosgar3D"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
