{"id": 203134, "slug": "string-raider", "name": "String Raider", "name_original": "String Raider", "description": "<p>(This game was made for miniLD 35, which had the theme \"Dare\")<br/></p><p>A ship is on its way to Earth when asteroids appear. Guns are too expensive and stuff, so to defeat them you can only use the power of YOUR KEYBOARD. </p><p>How long can you take? </p><p>-One button is too little, eight buttons is \"ok\", but what if you had about forty seven buttons? Welcome to String Raider. </p><p>-Pseudo-ASCII/Glitch aesthetics, just because I dared to do it. </p><p>-Compare your scores with other players, or tweet intergalactic gibberish to your followers. </p><p>-Hotseat action! One player takes control of the ship with A-Z, which has to survive for 30 secs, while the other controls the asteroids with 0-9. For player 2 I recommend using the numpad numbers, but if you want to dare me and your opponent and use the numbers above the letters, then go ahead!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3fc259f3a6a83de18fffae0c5e4da7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Manuel Magalh\u00e3es"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
