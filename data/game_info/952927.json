All the ingredients and materials necessary are available on site, but it's up to YOU to get the right drinks to the customers. As with any bar, customers will pay for most stuff you serve them... but will pay better if you're spot on. There's only a few rules about what you CANNOT do. If you start poisoning or angering the customers, you'll get us shut down.
