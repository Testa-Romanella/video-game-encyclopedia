If you do not succeed in escaping, the world will cease to exist, taking you with it. But, to you, this world is just a game, isn't it? The game, too, is aware of this fact, and it is aware of what\u00a0<em>you</em> are as well.</p>\n<p>Because this world is not real, physically trying to hurt the enemies will result in failure. Your main mode of offense are Red, Green, and Blue energies that you can cast on the enemies to corrode and corrupt their data. This is the only way to truly destroy something that doesn't exist.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackeys 2022.1 Game Jam with the theme,\u00a0\"It is Not Real\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c2/7c2225d72c174c41f6192b19564623e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Icosmophedron"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
