In a world suffering from an energy scarcity crisis, a remote facility has rediscovered an ancient alternative to electricity that could save them. But there's a catch - anything that runs on this power has a tendency to jump between the present and the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This game is based on an idea that I've had for a long time, and have even tried to create a few times. I revamped the idea for this jam, as I was fusing it with another (in-person) jam with the theme \"Time\". It feels good to be able to develop it more, and now I have better ideas of what I want to do with this concept in the future!</p>\n<p>I also spent quite a while creating a dialogue engine in Godot (my tool of choice), and even if it takes me a while to get back to this game, I'll definitely reuse that code in the near future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac8/ac8068debd738d5cf952d2cfb29d8dd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cicada Carpenter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
