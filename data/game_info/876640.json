What can I say?</p>\n<p>DaRoach is a very simplistic arcade styled Maze Game where you play as the title character, DaRoach. Run around various mazes filled with traps and enemies to collect 4 gems before you run out of lives!</p>\n<p><strong><em>DAROACH'S MASTER THIEF GUIDE - THE BASICS</em></strong></p>\r\nControllerKeyboardMoveD-Pad / JoystickArrow KeysAcceptAZCancelBXExit LevelXShift\r\n<p>I suggest playing with a controller, but a keyboard works fine since it's just basic 4 direction movement. I didn't remove mouse click controls because, options right? But a friend told me Yumonsters kept crashing when they played the game like that. So idunno.</p>\n<p><strong><em>ARCADE MODE</em></strong></p>\n<p>A 10 level arcade ladder. Guide DaRoach through Quito Corp's floors, robbing them blind and taking all their money! There's fun cutscenes (like 3 of them BUT STILL!)</p>\n<p><strong><em>ENDLESS MODE</em></strong></p>\n<p>How many levels can you clear with only 3 lives? Only one way to find out! Dive into Endless Mode and play as long as you can across roughly 27 levels.</p>\n<p><strong><em>CHARACTERS</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>TRICKS AND TREATS</em></strong></p>\n<strong>DOOR</strong>\u00a0- Just a regular door. Nothing fancy. <br/>Run through it to open it! <br/>But be warned, some enemies will be able to <br/>Walk through once you open it for them.<strong><em>SPIKES</em></strong> - Run over the regular holes <br/>and spikes will pop out! <br/>It's a one way street! You can run over the spikes <br/>again if you don't mind losing some points and time.<strong><em>SWITCH DOOR</em></strong> - When the door is down, you can walk right on through.<br/>But if it's up, no one can move through it. Hit the switch to change the door's state!<strong>ARROWS</strong> - Green means go, Red means stop. <br/>Touching the green one speeds DaRoach up, <br/>touching red slows him down!<strong><em>ROOMBUG</em></strong> - A regular cleaning roomba. They move<br/>quick, but if you're still when they touch you, you'll be<br/>safe!<strong><em>MISSILE </em></strong>- HUH!? Why is Quito Corp developing<br/>weapons!? These missiles follow you around intensely.<br/>But they can also destroy anything that might contain<br/>gems in them when the gems aren't at the 4 corners of<br/>a stage (nudge nudge wink wink say no more).<strong><em>TREASURE</em></strong> - Random treasures left around on each level!<br/>Be sure to pick these up! They're worth a lot of points<br/>and are your best chance to get a 1-Up in Arcade Mode!<strong><em>GEMS</em></strong> - The main goal of the game! Collect all 4 to beat<br/>the stage! The 4 gems are always tucked away in the 4<br/>corners of each stage, so just make your way there!\r\n<p><strong><em>OTHER PRO TIPS</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1-Ups :\u00a0</strong>You can only get 1-Ups in Arcade Mode, but if you get a high enough score you'll be able to find them!</p>\n<p><strong>Edges of the map :</strong> The center left/right edges of the map will teleport you to the other side! No escaping your 9 to 5!</p>\n<p><strong>Holding Shift :</strong> Pressing shift during any level will allow you to quit back to the main menu! You'll be given an instant game over and have to start all over though! Holding shift while pressing Scores will also give you the option to delete your save data, if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Over :</strong> If you run out of lives, you get a Game Over. In Endless, you'll be booted back to the title. But in Arcade, you'll be given the chance to try the level over again like nothing happened. Nobody saw that!</p>\n<p><strong>Continue later : </strong>In Arcade mode only, the game will save between each stage. Meaning you can just close out of the game and it'll keep your progress. DO NOT EXIT WITH SHIFT IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE LATER, that will delete your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets? :</strong> Some stuff might become available after you beat Arcade Mode once... Hidden somewhere on the main menu. Idunno. I can't say more, they're coming for-</p>\n<p>OH NO, THEY FOUND ME!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong><em>PLUGINS USED</em></strong></p>\n<p>REMOVETITLESCREEN PLUGIN CREATED BY SUMRNDMDDE</p>\n<p>EVENTS_TOUCHING_TRIGGER PLUGIN CREATED BY CT_BOLT</p>\n<p>Thank you both again for your plugins, the game wouldn't have been possible without them!</p>\n<p>And that's about the gist of it!
