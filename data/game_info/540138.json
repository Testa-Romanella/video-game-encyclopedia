The students had to make a game based on old Atari/Arcade game, but with some changes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I took Space Invaders and thought\u00a0\u00a0about a game that the player could practice Math while playing the good old-school shooter. The ideia here is to hit the aliens using divisible numbers. I also implemented a prime number power up when the player hit the red spaceship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space Number runs on PC and it was created with Unity Engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Language: Portuguese.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3189897d5390035344b8d93c8115be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maeda Desenvolvedor"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
