Players play as the god of the universe and control molecules of the universe through gravity string. This is a simulation of theoretical physics. The phenomena in game are controlled by fundamental interaction. There are weak , electromagnetic , strong and gravitation interactions. There are gravitational strings between players and influence each other's universe through quantum entanglement. There is a server at present, but the stability of the network still needs to be tested.<br/><br/>Players release energy (mass, space) in game. Every time a big bang occurs or civilizations evolved, players will gain some power from it. These powers are used to generate gravity, and the amount of powers players used. Will be affecting the amount of the gravity. In this virtual 2D universe, we can create countless big bangs.<br/><br/>0.1a:<br/><ul>1. Play async with other players through quantum entanglement.</ul><ul>2. 7 life forms.</ul><ul>3. 7 civilization levels by Kardashev scale. When one of your civilizations reaches level 5. You can expand your universe by increase the mass you get from other universe.</ul><ul>4. When average mass reaches 0. Means the universe has no energy anymore. The game is over. But it`s really hard to get this. You can try it.</ul><br/>Players can play offline or online whatever you like. In the future, players will be free to create the server of the universe and allow to modify the parameters like coefficients of interactions or color mask. Of course players can modify them right now but it`s a little difficult for most players.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T03:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bc3af80875f4337d938bc8ff54275dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["softpak"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["softpak"], "esrb_rating": null}
