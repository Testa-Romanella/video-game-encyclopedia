Work, family and friend responsibilities, Unity lagging to a crawl,\u00a0my internet shitting itself ever 10 minutes (this is not a joke btw, my internet has been going in and out for several days now). I knew that I wouldn't be able to do much for this jam just because I was really busy, but I'm not super happy with how it turned out. I may or may not make a video about its development ( I record whatever I worked on when I remembered to) and it'll be added to this page if/when that happens.<br/></p>\n<p>When with all of this, I had fun doing this jam. I've been taking a break since my college semester has ended and this was at least something to get me back into doing things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T20:03:31", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIxNjYwNjUucG5n/original/GMKhPC.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Cline"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
