Players can create scenarios anywhere in the continental United States with instant access to over 625,000 map tiles each with 15,000 pixels of high-detail GIS data (DLCs).  These map tiles can be assembled together to generate small to EPIC size maps (up to 36km x 36km)! Considering the scale is 1:30, this gives a bigger picture as seen from an Incident Commander's perspective. You'll have access to over 9.1 billion pixels of GIS data of real locations! This forest fire simulator is unlike anything you've seen before! Get ready to experience the true challenges of containing wildfires!<br/><br/>For the science people who want to know, this wildland firefighting simulator uses real GIS data from the US Landfire government website and calculates fire spread based on Rothermel\u2019s Surface Fire Spread Model. What that means is that there are 40 different ways a fire can burn each with its own rate of spread and flame length (based on wind speed). The unit movements are scaled accurately based on these fuel codes. A brush truck moves faster on a road (100km/h) but slower through low shrubs (20km/h). <br/><br/>Units are rewarded experience and coins for every contained pixel. Cooperate with other players for the maximum experience!<br/><br/>Be awesome and add FireJumpers Inferno to your wishlist!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T04:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/899/899dbf97604d066ebf69c6fe49100127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jason Thomas"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jason Thomas"], "esrb_rating": null}
