{"id": 906237, "slug": "top-down-racer-unconventional-controls", "name": "Top-Down Racer (Unconventional Controls)", "name_original": "Top-Down Racer (Unconventional Controls)", "description": "<p>An experimental prototype of a top-down racing game using an unconventional control scheme to challenge a player's stamina and dexterity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Control the acceleration of the car by <strong>scrolling upwards</strong> on the mouse scroll wheel, or deceleration by <strong>scrolling downwards</strong>. Turn left and right by using the left and right mouse buttons respectively.</p>\n<p>2 seperate files for downloading. Top file - topdown MSW controller is the game file best suited for using the mouse scroll wheel configuration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bottom file - topdown WASD controls is best suited for conventional WASD movement.</p>\n<p>Reason for two seperate files is due to the speed difference between the 2 inputs. WASD speed is instant and therefore required less force to be added to vehicle in game to achieve top speed, MSW controls required larger force to be applied to vehicle to give similar sense of speed to WASD settings.</p>\n<p>Suggestion: time yourself completing X number of laps using the standard WASD controls and then see if yuo can beat those times using the MSW control scheme. Good Luck!</p>\n<p><em>Credits: assets from Kenny.NL</em></p>\n<p><em>Coding from PrettyFlyGames on Youtube.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T08:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1f0be4a16ac3f08b2e4b0a8c87090d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geeksmurph"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
