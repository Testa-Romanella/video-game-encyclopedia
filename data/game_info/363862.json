You have the entire range of abilities that you would in a normal platformer, but only one key to bind them all to. Pressing the key you've chosen will perform all the actions bound to it, but not every action will work at once. For example, moving left and right at the same time isn't going to get you moving in either direction. Toggle what abilities are bound to your key to run, jump, and dash your way around collecting coins. Collect all 15 coins to become rich.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Some keys (such as enter, space, etc.) may also toggle selected inputs! If your favorite key is one of these keys make sure to click on the character to prevent this!</p>\n<p>If you find you are unable to jump on certain platforms try refreshing the game. It's one of those lovely bugs that\u00a0<em>sometimes</em>\u00a0happens.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21fee7d24e4e97a568760927b7190d4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcadim"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
