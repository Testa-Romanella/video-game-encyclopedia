You survive 15 waves of enemies and upgrade your plucky little ship between each level across 8 different stats (damage, fire rate, hp, shield &amp; 4 powerups). Change colours to dodge enemies and deal damage to foes, as damage is only dealt if the colour of the bullet matches the enemy ship. The same goes for the player too though, so be careful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/958152369b24bdcc184e2b995edca87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bocodillo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
