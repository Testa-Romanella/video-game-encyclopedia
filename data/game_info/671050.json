I found that the textual organization possibilities in Twine were infinite; it allowed me to create loops in the narrative, whereby users could only progress to the next level of the story by viewing a specific slide, for instance. I also found that a creative employment of analepsis introduced a new theme into the piece, one of non-temporality, which greatly expanding the scope and depth of the story. From a literary point of view, I began to see that my narrative was too androcentric. I decided to rename it \u201cThe Salt Creatures\u201d, and give the main character a feminine form. Finally, by uploading the story onto itch.io, it is my hope that user/reader comments will allow others who are perhaps more familiar with the sci-fi genre to offer critiques and ideas for a reworking of the narrative, thus leaving open the possibility that the project will become something more collaborative in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8d5d91c63ea8ab8fae73fc3fd7bd9de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tremulous_cadence"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
