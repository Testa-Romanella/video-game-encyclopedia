The direct sequel to Theme Park (Theme Hospital and Theme Aquarium are thematic sequels), the player constructs and manages an amusement park with the aim of making profit and keeping visitors happy. Initially developed for Windows, it was ported to PlayStation and PlayStation 2 (whose version was titled Theme Park Roller Coaster in North America), as well for Macintosh computers. The Mac version was published by Feral Interactive.<br />\nThe game was developed because personnel at Bullfrog wanted to bring the original Theme Park up-to-date. Theme Park World features four themes of amusement park, the ability to ride attractions, and an online service that enabled players to share parks. Reception was mostly positive, with reviewers complimenting the sound and visuals, although some were critical of the interface. The game was followed by Theme Park Inc (also known as Sim Coaster) in 2001.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-16T21:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec71d8ec72ea2f2ff240150f18a2e78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.04, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 14, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 28, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 28, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 2", "PC"], "developers": ["Bullfrog Productions", "Climax Studios", "Zonic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
