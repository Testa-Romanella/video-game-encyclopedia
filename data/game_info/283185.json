As cars on the road increases, so does the demand of parking spots. Technology is here to help though. Instead of thinking horizontal, some smart people went vertical and invented huge sophisticated machines that could cater for 15-20 cars in the space of 3-4 cars.<br/><br/>These monstrous parking machines are absolutely fascinating and a sight to behold. You will always notice that one passer-by who pauses for a moment to see this automated smart parking system in action. In this game, we have tried to simulate this system to give you a taste of the real thing.<br/><br/>Since we are going vertical, you need to be really accurate in parking on the given spot so that there are no balancing issues. You also need to fill the empty spots optimally to make sure the cars are un-parked in time.<br/><br/>So give it a shot - start your career as a smart parking valet operator and let\u2019s park all those cars.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e68988a31393deb81b573cc94eaa0d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["elinx technologies"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": ["elinx technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
