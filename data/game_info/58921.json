It is based on a 1984 board game Mutants.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which a nuclear war annihilated all humanity. Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things. There&#39;s The Ark, a neon-lit sinkhole that serves as the hub for the player characters. This is where they can buy ammunition and armor, meet other characters and accept quests. Then there&#39;s the Zone, a largely unexplored dangerous world where Mutants roam. Somewhere in the Zone lies the legendary Eden, a safe haven where they can find all the answers they seek.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The game has three main protagonists. First, there&#39;s Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there&#39;s Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin. Each of the characters specializes in using certain weapons and has a set of special mutant abilities.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden combines real-time exploration and stealth system with square grid-bound tactical turn-based combat in the vein of X-Com series. The player controls the three characters as a party, switching between them when needed.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T08:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fcc/fccc143096ea188a7fb7daab52d26e35.jpg", "website": "https://www.mutantyearzero.com/", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 311, "owned": 1646, "beaten": 205, "toplay": 154, "dropped": 212, "playing": 45}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 169, "ratings_count": 460, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 467, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Funcom Oslo A/S", "The Bearded Ladies", "The Bearded Ladies Consulting"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Funcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
