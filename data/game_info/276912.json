{"id": 276912, "slug": "color-deluxe", "name": "Color Deluxe", "name_original": "Color Deluxe", "description": "Color Deluxe is a coloring book competition designed to provide users with a fun and playful experience. By filling in designs of various shapes and sizes using rhythmic finger tapping, you\u2019re invited into a trance-like state that is as much restorative as it is addictive. Choose your coloring path wisely! The best tactics for filling in the forms will put you at the top of the leaderboard.<br/><br/>\u2022 FUN \u2022 The premise of Color Deluxe is playful, borrowing from the tradition of coloring books. An estimated 12 million adult coloring books were sold in the United States in the year 2015 alone. Coloring is not only a throwback to childhood, but also a unique, increasingly popular activity in the wellness sector. By creating semi and symmetrical forms, our game invites you into a meditative trance that is hard to achieve anywhere else. <br/><br/>\u2022 SOCIAL \u2022 Craving more social time? Us too. That\u2019s why it was important to us that the game is designed as a friendly competition. We turn our game into a competition to bring people together over something healthy and enjoyable. Metrics rank users and their friends on their levels of concentration and state of relaxation.<br/><br/>\u2022 DOSAGE \u2022 Color Deluxe is best played on a daily basis for 20-30 minutes. We recommend you treat Color Deluxe like learning a new habit, setting aside a certain time each day to absorb your mind in its routine. It can be morning or night, while you\u2019re on the train, first thing in the morning, or while falling asleep in bed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f39fe6d8eaf987eb652c411ca7bce7d_o8fe53E.jpg", "website": "https://www.colordeluxegame.com/contact", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Juan Gabriel Palomino Garcia"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Juan Gabriel Palomino Garcia"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
