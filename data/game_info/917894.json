{"id": 917894, "slug": "qiybz", "name": "Qiybz", "name_original": "Qiybz", "description": "Qiybz is a game where you control an automatically jumping cube with other randomized cubes being as platforms and / or enemies. The main goal is to achieve the largest true highscore possible, but beware! The higher the score, the higher the difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe spawned cubes are randomized and there are over 20 different cube types that can be spawned, provided certain in-game conditions are met. With randomization also comes the so-called probability hierarchy, with some cubes being so rare that you might not see one even after ten thousand cubes. Familiarizing yourself with the cube types also gains an advantage over randomly jumping on cubes. The gaps between the cubes ensure that precision in landing on to the platforms is crucial. Enemy elimination is also important, as you will see if you try this game...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote that spontaneous change of character skin is not possible, and you must change the skin manually if you want it to change. The same goes for backgrounds. Based on player feedback this can be subject to change, and spontaneous change especially for backgrounds might become a feature in the future. Soundtracks can change based on in-game conditions, but not all soundtracks are available this way, and some must be activated manually if one wants to listen to them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81ee5a2f9cf14aaa81e27366e855614c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesse Sakari Hyttinen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jesse Sakari Hyttinen"], "esrb_rating": null}
