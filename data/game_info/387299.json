{"id": 387299, "slug": "aria-dating-simulator", "name": "Aria Dating Simulator", "name_original": "Aria Dating Simulator", "description": "Meet Aria, a sweet, vibrant, innocent, indecent girl who has just recently been dragged into adulthood kicking and screaming. She's now out on her own, and wants a refund from life! She's down on her luck, but also in luck! She's ripe for the picking, and already has two pickers: Helena, her bestest online buddy, who's trained in the art of fourth-wave feminism, and Jim, a man who just ran into her, could probably never love another person more than the sight of his own reflection! Over the course of the game, you'll come to understand Aria (or at least try to), and learn what makes her heart soar straight into the sun... and what makes her rage. And maybe.. just maybe... if you're lucky, you just might get lucky!<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>This game is a comedy, but also very NSFW visual novel, based off the Sweetest Feminist comic series. The gameplay is based on choices that the player makes, and making bad, good, or the best choices. The player will not want to make Aria too angry if they wish to progress, but it's really fun to make her angry, though! The game features two modes, 68 choices, and 6 endings total. (Some endings are more difficult to access than others.)<h3>Game features</h3><ul><li>4K hand-drawn digital art.<br/></li><li>6 endings.<br/></li><li>68 choices for the player to make.<br/></li><li>Colorful characters.<br/></li><li>An autosave and manual save function.<br/></li><li>All original music and score.<br/></li><li>Censorship that can be enabled for those who wish to keep their eyes pure.<br/></li><li>Dialogue threads that keep you on your toes.<br/></li><li>Stupid humor.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T02:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/21595801f1d2084ea277fd52be3524d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dominic Wilson"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Domonization"], "esrb_rating": null}
