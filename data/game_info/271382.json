Push him off mountains, off skyscrapers, backflip him in to turbo cars, and even throw him in to an asteroid. This is bone breaking, dummy snapping physics fun at its best. Lots of levels to make the fun last, hilarious situations, and bags of re-play value. Just tap the ok buttons when he's standing to dismount him.<br/><br/>DOWNLOAD IT NOW :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88e2108eb8b3f160de5b747f37678c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Finch"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Martin Finch"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
