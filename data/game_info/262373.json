In the sky above Tokyo, events are transpiring to lead to just such an event. The only ones who can stop this form happening are the Maidens, young girls with the ability to communicate with beings from the Elemental world known as Arcana.</p>\n<p>Arcana Heart is a 2D fighting game ported from the arcade original. Choose one of eleven Maidens, and from eleven Arcanas each with their own unique abilities, and get to the bottom of what&#39;s happening in Tokyo. The game plays similarly to the Guilty Gear series, incorporating a variety of advanced techniques such as air dashing and dash cancels, and making for complicated high-speed battles.</p>\n<p>The game includes standard story, arcade, and versus modes, along with a training mode and an unlockable illustration gallery. Players can choose between the original version of the characters or the rebalanced versions from the arcade update Arcana Heart FULL!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c26/c26f96cdc22dd166f687223a355e1866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["EXAMU"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Atlus USA"], "esrb_rating": null}
