{"id": 118532, "slug": "the-bard-actionrpg", "name": "The Bard [ActionRPG]", "name_original": "The Bard [ActionRPG]", "description": "<p>Hello there !</p><p>\"The Bard\" is the remake of an old RPG Maker I had going on a few years ago.\u00a0</p><p>It was a story about a young, lazy boy who was expelled from his house for refusing to get a job. His only talent being being good with the sword, he decided to travel to the royal city to serve in the army, in the name of the king.\u00a0</p><p>The theme of the game was coming of age, and indeed our hero would go through challenges and meet people he would help along his way. There was a comical tone to eveyrything in the world, and it was a go-anywhere, do-what-you-want kind of experience - the story was in the background, and you would enjoy your play time doing side-quests and finding more about the world.\u00a0You could join clans and work as a miner, blacksmith, shop assistant. The main village of the game had different people walking around in the streets every time you exited and entered the map. There was a day/night cycle, and people had their own routine and everything. It was all made in RPG Maker VX Ace. Now I want to port it all and make it a 3D experience, with Unity 2017.</p><p>Right now, I'm still in the beginning of this journey. I\u00a0have already coded stuff way beyond my (very) amateurish skills. I have a functional save/load game system that works between scenes and saves your inventory and quests! I have the combat, which I'm deeply satisfied =) I\u00a0have the inventory (made with the help of Brackey's videos), and a quest log system I coded myself.\u00a0</p><p>You can play a bit of the intro and fight with 4 different types of enemies:\u00a0a bandit, a slime, a mushroom, and a thief! You can't complete any of the quests you receive. =) And the map is still a bit empty in some areas, but you can already do a lot of stuff, so if you want , download it, test it and give me your thoughts!</p><p>Thank you =)</p><p>---</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>Most scripts by me. I used a footstep system from the Asset Store, but I\u00a0think that was it!</p><p>Most 3D assets by me with a few exceptions (trees and some vegetation are not mine, some were made by Unkind Fox).\u00a0</p><p>All characters modelled and textured by me.</p><p>Mixamo - All the animations (except for the slime and the mushroom) are from Adobe's Mixamo website.</p><p>Lots of SFX from\u00a0Premiumbeats</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/67970ab561bf4b313b1d9e892bdd1656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andr\u00e9 Fernandes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
