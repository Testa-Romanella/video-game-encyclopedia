I've spent about 30 hours for now. It's all about endless run with one simple mechanic. Game needs a bit more love but it's playable and even fun (atleast IMO :D). If you played please leave some feedback, i'd love to read some :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:21:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bc155f4181a6b84659fea0656bee1e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uncle_Koggy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
