I\u00a0wanted 5-10 levels, I\u00a0ended up with 3.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you play the game use the exe labelled PLAY ME, not the actual unity game.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you have a 4k monitor, you're going to have a bad time and I'm sorry.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/7749a2f9dbb29a98af9b2818d888dad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TylerC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
