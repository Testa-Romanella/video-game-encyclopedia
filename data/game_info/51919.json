You\u2019re left to face the outside world alone, but everything is difficult when you have a disability. Just because you have a disability, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy life. It just makes even the mundane parts of life, an experience. <br/><br/><strong>\"An Aspie Life\"</strong> is an experimental adventure game that deals with the topic of Asperger's Syndrome. The game is centred around having to live with this disability. The players actions in the game will have to adapt to how an autistic person sees the world. Every element of this game recreates how people with autism perceive the world. All forms of sound, graphics and interactions are intentional.<br/><br/> <br/><strong>How it represents parts of Asperger's Syndrome. </strong><br/><ul><li>There\u2019s a lot going on in An Aspie life that is meant to make players feel like they are on the spectrum. It\u2019s a little easier in a list:<br/></li><li>All character in An Aspie Life are black outlines. By doing this, players can\u2019t read body language. Just like with someone with autism.  <br/></li><li>Some characters that the main character knows well, are not black outlines and have some detail. But they are still darkened. This represents how some with autism can learn someone\u2019s body language if they have known them for a long time. <br/></li><li>In the game every environmental sound gets represented on the sound sensitivity meter. The player must keep this under control, so the main character does not become overwhelmed. This represents Sound sensitivity in autism. <br/></li><li>In conversations, the player again can\u2019t read body language, as they are all black outlines.  But they must try and figure out how to respond with limited vocabulary. This represents the difficulty Aspies have in putting thoughts into sentences that people can understand. <br/></li><li>Also in conversations, the player\u2019s feeling meters of stress, happiness, courage and uneasiness will affect how a conversation plays out. For example, not much courage means you can\u2019t look at the other person. <br/></li><li>To regenerate the feeling meter, players must go into quiet places or do things that the main character enjoys. That being, playing video games. <br/></li><li>The game\u2019s art style of blue and purple, represent not just the 80/90s feel of the game but also social isolation. Some items in the game that hold great importance to the main character are not in blue/purple but are in full colour, because of how important they are.</li></ul><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b22c6d2f0791088519e3d454f88313.jpg", "website": "https://mebradhen.github.io/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 129, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bradley Hennessey", "Joe Watson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EnderLost Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
