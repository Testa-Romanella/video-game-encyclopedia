This one has newtonian physics though, so controlling the ship might be a little more complicated.</p>\n<p>Right now the game includes free movement through a small galaxy quadrant. You can recollect iron ore by breaking asteroids with your weaponry, and travel until you have no fuel.</p>\r\nWHAT TO TEST RIGHT NOW\r\n<p>Simply explore, break , and please let me know what you think the controls feel like.\u00a0Also feel free to talk about framerates and consider sharing your PC specs. The game is still in early development so that might be still an issue.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nSpacecraft\r\n<ul><li>Tab - Toggles on/off the entire ship.</li><li>L - Turn on/off the lights.</li></ul>\r\nCamera\r\n<ul><li>C - Change to next camera.</li><li>F1 to F12 - Change to specific camera.

Since the amount of weapon slots varies from a spacecraft to another (might even consider making battleships with 20+ weapons), I thought about making kind of loadouts. So you have three, maybe more firing buttons with which you use all your weapons. By default there is three loadouts.</p>\n<ul><li>0: Ctrl fires Laser. Alt fires both Left and Right Missiles.
