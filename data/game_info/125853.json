I've been playing Blizzard games ever since I had a computer good enough to run them, heck I'm even listening to a podcast on the past, present, and future of Starcraft right now. Enough fanboying, I finally decided to pool all of my Blizzard love into one place and start creating a TD that I would want to play as much as every other Blizzard game. </p><p><strong>Goals:</strong></p><p>Stacky Blocky will change over time depending on what mechanics turn out to be awesome. To start, the initial iterations are going to be focusing on crafting combinations with different types of towers through stacking blocks as well as using a central tower to micro last hitting minions for extra gold or helping clean up tricky waves.</p><p>You can check out what I'm working on next here.</p><p>Trello Link: https://trello.com/b/KqkCo6Q0/tower-wars</p><p>Or read my blog here.</p><p>Blog: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=51382</p><p><strong>Technical:</strong></p><p>I'm creating the game in Unity, Photoshop, and Blender this will be my first big 3D project although I have done 3D work in the past. In terms of aesthetic, I'm looking to create something low poly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2ad806c51b0c01420fce0274aa61720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["2d_Sparrow"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
