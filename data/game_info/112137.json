You can also download the Windows and the MacOS builds. MacOS version has a few updates missing, I guess it's impossible to reach a score of 50 on that one.</p><p>Arhan Bakan: Programming, Game Design</p><p>Fatih Alt\u0131nok: Programming, Game Design (itch.io Profile)</p><p>Volkan Ongun: 3D, Game Design (itch.io Profile)</p><p>M\u00fcberra Kablan: Illustration, Game Design</p><p>Bar\u0131\u015f Yaman: Music (Niragaza D\u0131br\u0131\u015fka)</p><p>Made for Global Game Jam 2017 in Ankara, Turkey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfa52d4b4a4b0e5bc103fff57f4ce908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["arhpositive", "Fatih Altinok", "volkanongun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
