You got blasted back into time in space and are stuck. You can only get back to the real world by crafting your portal again! To do that, you must fight, gather, trade, and buy from shops to get what you need to make a portal. 25 steel + ions. Good Luck!</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W - move up</li><li>A - move left</li><li>S - move down</li><li>D - move right</li><li>Left Click - shoot</li></ul>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>Source Code -\u00a0https://github.com/SwiftyProgrammer690/github-gameoff-2022</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2022 Game Off Game Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:35:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e73/e73f050f35f3ada4c6ba2c07426077a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SwaritChoudhari"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
