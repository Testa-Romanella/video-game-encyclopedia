In each room, you will wire up the lifts, doors, switches and fuel cells in order to get through. The puzzle mechanics are built on an accurate model of how electricity behaves and as you progress through the game you will solve problems that are not usually encountered until A-level physics. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the game, you encounter cine projector screens giving information you need in order to progress and slowly unravelling the mystery of who you are, why you are there and why the professor built this strange thing in the first place.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c4fb5827a30514818d4ecb091514a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["University of Cambridge Engineering Department"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["University of Cambridge Engineering Department"], "esrb_rating": null}
