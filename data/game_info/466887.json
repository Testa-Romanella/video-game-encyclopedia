Your walk on the park will depend on how you balance both.<br/><br/><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong><br/><strong>1. do not\u00a0be a bad boy!\u00a0(not too much)<br/>going far from your owner scores you bad-boy points, too many bad-boy points and your walk on the park will be cancelled early :(<br/>2. enjoy life's pleasures:<br/>you like your owner, he makes you happy, but you would rather spend your time running around. Balance is key.<br/>3. the world is distracting, embrace that.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong>Mouse only. The dog will go towards the mouse cursor. The camera moves automatically towards the closest interest points.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>@titwin: Implementation, design<br/>@saltadrow:\u00a0design, sound, music inspired from:\u00a0Initial D - deja vu<br/>@solroo: Implementation, art</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong><br/>* Mainly inspired by this gif<br/>* Main dog based on the work of fulifuli<br/>* Speed lines from here (creative commons)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8fa6a0d32eccaf55385f738483d50abd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saltadrow", "Joan Sol ROO"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
