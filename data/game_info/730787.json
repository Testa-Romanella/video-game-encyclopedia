It quickly becomes apparent that there is some being speaking through the phone, coercing you to act in certain ways.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made in just two days by a group of three in Twine as part of the Global Game Jam. The developers were unexperienced with Twine and thus did not have enough time to develop any \"game\"-like mechanics. Regardless, we are proud of what we created and hope to develop it further in future !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a4984f04e320d7a2bb5acf6779e9e7b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikyle Fourie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
