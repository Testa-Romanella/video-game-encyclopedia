This is a game many of you wanted to create when you was eight. No online, no services, no DLCs, no open-world, no rogulike, no roguelite, no depression metaphors, no metroidvania, no backtracking. Can't say \"no god\" cause god participate in one of boss fights. Not on your side. It's just straight line from start to finish. And skill required to get through it. And timer if this is not enough. Party like 1989.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is fully functional and completed game created live, during streams. Viewers of youtube channel \"Explaining Every String\" seen creation of this game from very first line. You can see it too (in Russian, unfortunately). Or read on github. First is was educational project but at some point it turned into something close to Andy Warhol movies. Alone man creating videogame while time passes. But I did it (almost, soft is never complete). 400+ streams and here we are.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe're dealing with twin-stick shooter. These game features 15 levels in 5 \"bioms\" + 6 boss fights (god I love boss fights). There are 15 mini-bosses in 15 ordinary levels. You have some arsenal with golden classic like shotgun or rocket launcher and dash to correct your mistake or turn around your luck. Unfortunately, I'm not an artist at all so I gone full retro. Recreated vibes of overcoming 1983 crisis. Colors of NES, sounds of some ancient machine, music a-la \"Mozart meets NintendoCore\" and simplistic graphic. Also it includes some simple cut-scenes with story. You can even try to figure out what it means. Special entertainment for whose who loves soulsbourne games.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you think you can do better do it. Code licensed under MIT. Assets under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.
