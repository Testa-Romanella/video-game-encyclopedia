What if there was a puzzle game that requires using math to pass levels?</p>\n\n<p>Since this is currently a prototype, a spawn menu is provided. Numbers from 0 to 9 only work. Math symbols need to be typed like this: \"+\" = \"plus\"</p><p>You need to put the math numbers and symbols in a valid order, the equals needs to be placed after the numbers and the symbols. If the equals turns to a number, then you got a result.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is slightly unplayable due to weird issues of the unity build thing, hopefully I can find a way to fix it sometime soon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T10:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e1681485e79216465a5eb5c891a9118e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voxelstice"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
