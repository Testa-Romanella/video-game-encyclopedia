Shoot, throw grenades and bash to survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was a bit more experimental to try and make some relatively simple gameplay feel satisfying with sound design and visual effects like screen shake and particle effects.</p>\n<p>All feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>wasd, mouse: movement</p>\n<p>left click: shoot, right-click: grenade</p>\n<p>Left Shift: Bash, when near to a projectile, bash will pause time and let you dash away, throwing the projectile in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p>KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES:</p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes when bashing the aim gets missaligned. I am looking into a fix for this but it seems to be fixed by bashing again.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30dd285364ac37c164b2d65e9ffd4351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leon stansfield"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
