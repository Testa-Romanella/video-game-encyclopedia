The seeker is a large, sinister robot in control of the factory. He knows there are rogue androids amid his facility and his mission is to find and destroy them.<br/><br/>The PC players take the role of the rouge androids. The only way to escape the seeker is to switch off the control panels located around the factory and shut the facility down. <br/><br/>This is a pickup and play game that will keep you and your friends on the edge of your seats. There are 3 extensive maps each with a different theme and features. Both roles have access to creative power-ups, that if used cleverly can completely change the game advantage. Each round is always tense and never the same.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022\tLocal and online multiplayer game 1 VR vs up to 4 PC players<br/>\u2022\tGreat party VR game <br/>\u2022\tEasy \u201cpick up and play\u201d <br/>\u2022\tVR headset not required to play as rogue android <br/>\u2022\t3 exhilarating maps<br/>\u2022\tCreative power-ups for both roles <br/>\u2022\tRe-playable<br/>\u2022\tCustom game settings<br/>\u2022\tTrading Cards and Badges", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a63ca5e339d9e7b9f918fec8cc94ac.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/polymerse/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 25, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polymerse"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polymerse"], "esrb_rating": null}
