The premise \r\nof the game is that you have a battery draining away its energy to keep a\r\n remote system operational. What you need to do is rewire the broken \r\ncircuits to supply power from the main node to the battery.</p>\n<p>You \r\nhave seven parts, each part has a unique resistance value. Create a \r\nchain of parts that match the resistance value to complete the circuit.</p>\n<p>You have to complete the circuit before the battery drains away.</p>\n<p>I ran into problems, since this was my first puzzle game, that i couldnt get any sounds or music in.</p>\n<p>So im opting out of the Audio category this time around.</p>\n<p>Hope you like the game, it was fun to try and attempt puzzle games.</p>\n<p>jcmonkey</p>\n<p>Twitter: @JCMonkeyD3 <br/></p>\n<p>Twitch: jcmonkey</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/692/6928835c904272227c2b9d3472aff7d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jcmonkey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
