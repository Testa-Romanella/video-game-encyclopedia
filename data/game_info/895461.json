That's why I decided to start a new project and abandon this project.</p>\n<p>The game is very sad. Each player has 100 health and it decreases by 10 with each shot. There is only one gun in the game. It works with WASD keys and shoots with the right click of the mouse.</p>\n<p>Note: Use UNET on the start page, not Transport, for reasons I don't know, it cannot connect to other computers with Transport, and it can only connect to the same computer where the Host is running.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T14:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76c/76c4064ee16652c9d14281b46bd7fa9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmirHoseinAdelfar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
