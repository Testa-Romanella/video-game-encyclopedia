This game can make people crazy, but it can also make you love it. We need to constantly try and understand the physical world in order to get through every level. Of course, each level may take us a long time, and the more difficult it becomes, but every time we reach the final exit, everything is worth it. In addition, players need to pay attention that we only have five jumping opportunities in each level. We must make rational use of them. Moreover, the small ball can only move forward and not backward, but we can achieve the purpose of backward by colliding with the wall. Everything needs to be explored by the players themselves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-09T21:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82f01525275dc25add4bbc22709e332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HuoChaiRenRPG"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["HuoChaiRenRPG"], "esrb_rating": null}
