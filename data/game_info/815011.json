But a tabletop game were your heroes are geeks you pick to fight seemed to fit the theme quite well.</p>\n<p>Happy with how it turned out technically, went with a fairly data driven code style which let me write a\u00a0small set of\u00a0code to handle all the characters and item effects, the same code for all player interactions, etc. Was pretty quick to write the code for the game\u00a0and very few issues to debug. Also wanted to try and use physical objects for all gameplay and UI as a bit of a challenge, which it\u00a0mostly ending up having, but did need to add some extra text hints to help stop people getting lost.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T15:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/0630e792211d57d4fd6dfdf9b80c7e10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lukeph"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
