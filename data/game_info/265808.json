For example a shotgun can rip a door off its hinges and the rocket launcher can blast some walls. There are more possible interactions but they may not be showcased in the demo. Also different ammo may have varying efficiency on different materials. Alien weapons, for example, tend to be ineffective on non-organic materials.</p>\n<p>Over 10 different kind of enemies with varying behaviours\u00a0(6 in the demo. some of them only appear in high difficulties).</p>\n<p>3 difficulty modes which determine the number of objectives and enemies as well as their level of intelligence (for example, increasing difficulty can allow them to use more senses and hints to detect you, allow them to take cover, or more surprising behaviours)</p>\n<p>The difficulty level doesn't have an impact on your health and damage nor on enemy health and damage. (but on high difficulty, they may aim at the head if you wear a body armour)</p>\n<p>After beating a level you can unlock challenges. Basically 2 time attack modes. Complete all the objectives, or kill all the enemies.</p>\n<p>There are some glitches, overall for me that works fine though.</p>\n<p>Saving only save the state at the start of the level, so loading will take you back to the beginning of the map.</p>\n<p>Some of the stuff shown here doesn't appear in the demo.</p>\n<p>It's a work in progress so stuff may change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16702b3be48fd69f7e7f5172b071edab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fauch"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
