Players guide a robot called &quot;Slambird&quot; through nine different scenarios to complete several objectives. The game was noted for its use of voxel-based graphics for its environments rather than the polygonal models which were standard at the time of its release. Developed by Lemon, Amok began as a technology demo for the Sega 32X, but was reworked for the Saturn after Sega discontinued support for the 32X</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-22T12:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce078f5d6a8566f8371e376ddf87b206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["Scavenger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Scavenger"], "esrb_rating": null}
