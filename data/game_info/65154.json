No one expected an attack, but the enemy suddenly did just that nonetheless, and that adversary is very strong.<br/><br/>To ensure security, you must quickly build your defensive structures using machine guns, rocket launchers and even a flamethrower. Those complexes must be prepared for incoming ground and air attack, for multiple sides. You earn resources from killing enemies and can use that to upgrade your weapons.<br/><strong>FEATURES :</strong><br/><strong>- Strategic gameplay.</strong><br/><strong>- Upgradable weapons.</strong><br/>- Multiple fronts of combat.<br/>- Time-Bullet", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81e4fef8ececd4dfa4ada057d98b1119.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 32, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falco Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OtakuMaker"], "esrb_rating": null}
