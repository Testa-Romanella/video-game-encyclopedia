The player has to turn 2 cards every time and find out the pairs of similar object in order to \"empty\" the table. The counter is responsible for the score so you have to be really fast. You can choose from 1 to 5 consecutive rounds each time. For every different number of rounds a highscore is always saved. The highscores are easily resettable.</p><p>Please play it and review.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/280a17d8580e2b8454bd96a2c79dd73b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saavedra29"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
