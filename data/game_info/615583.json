Use the left / right arrow or a controller - if you miss a gate for the third time, the game is over...</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam submission ever, a rather casual project practising Unity and C#. While making it I learned a bit about procedural terrain generation in an \"endless runner\" (or rather: endless roller) and I had my share of fun. If you're a participant in the jam, give my game a shot and comment if you like to, I'll do the same with your submissions.
