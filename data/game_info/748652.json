Introduce yourself to the color wheel while utilizing spatial perception for some passively educational excitement. Stretch your mind to combine and separate primary and secondary colors on a journey that immerses you in tough challenges and satisfying sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow to play<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe objective is to connect the circuit between the laser's start point with the endpoint node of the corresponding color using the modules available.<br/>\r\nTake full control of a 360\u00b0 rotational camera to see all the angles!<br/>\r\nManipulate lasers in 3 dimensions to overcome obstacles and avoid other lasers to accomplish your goals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenges<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll starting lasers have a length of 10 meters (or 10-floor tiles) with each redirecting module adding 3 meters.<br/>\r\nEnsure you have enough laser to reach the node.<br/>\r\nCombine primary colors to create secondary colors or split secondary colors to create primary colors with a split/combiner module to acquire the needed color for the node.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStuck on a puzzle?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith a non-linear progression system, simply move on to another puzzle, or for the truly determined use the built-in hint system to guide your way.<br/>\r\nBe warned, to use the hint system you must first collect the hint crystals. Many are easy to acquire but some may be more challenging than the puzzle itself!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nXbox controller support<br/>\r\nWindows: Fully Supported<br/>\r\nMac: Partially Supported<br/>\r\nLinux: Not Supported<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSee key binding documentation for controller layouts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T03:54:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b298e5ead9e27eef2c2d076f1d46924.jpg", "website": "https://circuitlasermaze.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Duston Parker"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gray Days Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
