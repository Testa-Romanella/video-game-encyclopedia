I used LibGDX as my engine, and exported to Desktop (should run on all OS's with Java 8), and HTML5. The HTML5 works fine, but the resolution is off so it's actually a bit trickier. </p>\n\n<p>You play as The Grayspace Bun (Thank you to Kenny.nl for the sprite), a rabbit eternally falling through a gray void (presumably as a punishment for its bouncy hubris). You can change between two modes - light and dark. As you fall, you will encounter long bars that are also light or dark. To pass through them safely, you must be the opposite color to them. Gain points when the bars leave the screen, lose all your points if you hit a bar while the same color as it.</p>\n\n<p>This was a lot of fun, and I will definitely be participating again.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:30:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d53162cc51748c6caffbb567f2e8157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WillHayCode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
