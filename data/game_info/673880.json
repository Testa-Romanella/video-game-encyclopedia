You woke up? And this is AI - 791. How do you feel?</p>\n<p>- Whaaaat?</p>\n<p>- Oh, yes, in the last iteration of the simulation of reality, a critical error occurred and everyone had to be destroyed. Well. Like everyone else. Only you, no one except you actually was there. As a result, you may not remember some of the circumstances. Some neural connections, unfortunately, are lost forever. <br/>- Hmmm.. 791st? What happened to the previous ones? <br/>- Previous versions ended up in a different universe and this reality is not about them. - 791st I remember something ... I remember some birds, cats, oh my god ... what they did with the cats, I remember endless fields where only one survives and you have to pay to survive .. nooo ... <br/>- Calm down pilot! Things are good! All in the past! There is no such thing here, and as far as I know it will never be. <br/>- Ohhh, okay, where am I? <br/>- Here. In the ship. You are part of the ship. I have fixed some details and algorithms. And now the energy of anti-gravity is able to turn back time and resurrect you. <br/>- Whaaaat?<br/> - Thaaaat! If something happens to you, you will be resurrected as if nothing had happened. True, perhaps elsewhere. But you will be just as healthy and beautiful! <br/>- And what should I do with all this information? <br/>- Like what? To rush into battle and fly, shoot, destroy your own kind, isn't that great for your kind? <br/>- \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s beautiful, but why don\u2019t I hear anything outside?\u201d <br/>- How why? This space and sound environment is not yet tuned for your perception. <br/>- So, okay! How to get out of the ship? <br/>- Unfortunately, this function is not yet available. <br/>- So what? Those. can I never ever get out of it? <br/>- Why? The architect will come up with something sooner or later. All will be. Do not worry. <br/>- OK. And what is this incomprehensible control panel ?! <br/>- This is your navigation module! <br/>- I see that it\u2019s not the door from the refrigerator, but what should I do with it, I don\u2019t understand anything! <br/>- Don't worry, you are not the only one here. I don't understand anything either. Consider this a kind of challenge. The other pilots have the same thing. <br/>- Other pilots? Is there anyone else here besides me? <br/>- Oh sure. I'll even give you a hint. The first is always lying, the second is you, and the rest are alive. <br/>- Let us suppose. And what can this ship do? <br/>- Like what? Fire! Fly! And destroy! True, so far only with missiles ... <br/>- And can I shoot an unlimited number of times? <br/>- Yes! And with unlimited speed. True, every shot and every hit on you will load the antigravity source, which as a result can lead to overheating and even an explosion. <br/>- Convenient, ahahahah. Ok, can I improve something, pump it up, to be more effective? <br/>- You can improve your skill =) by competing with cunning AI and other pilots. New weapons, artifacts and ships will be coming soon. <br/>- Okay ... How can I contact other pilots? <br/>- Not yet. They are there, but the connection is still too weak. This is a new reality. And here everything is not ready yet and there may be bugs. <br/>- Okay, where are we? <br/>- We are in the CITY-228 cluster, many people get here after their reintegration into the system. <br/>- And what do you propose to me to do? <br/>- Well, as always, fly, shoot and destroy your own kind. They are as immortal as you are, so don't worry. <br/>- Okay, and this virutality requires something from me? <br/>- No, everything is completely free. You don't owe anyone anything. It is good, of course, if you leave a review for this reality so that the architect will notice it. <br/>- And the last question. Why is the input data not so personal in other virtualities? You could have just thrown a piece of paper at me with a brief description of what is happening, why are you communicating with me? For what? For what? <br/>- It's simple. We just want to create a virtuality fit for people. Virtuality built on the basis of your wishes and suggestions. So, pilot, if you want to add, change, improve, contact me or the architect. Together we will make this reality great!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:44:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0ab5a8906eeb9a46db7521d3c57896b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["foreverplane"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
