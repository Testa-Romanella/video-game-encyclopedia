It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man X series and is a follow-up to Mega Man Xtreme, released the previous year. Mega Man Xtreme 2 takes place during the 22nd century, in an unknown year 21XX, between the events of Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4. The DNA souls of robots known as &quot;Reploids&quot; all around the world are being stolen by a pair of villains in order to create an army of undead &quot;Mavericks&quot;. The &quot;Maverick Hunters&quot; Mega Man X and Zero quickly spring into action, now with the help of their young ally Iris.<br />\nMega Man Xtreme 2 is a similar take on the series action and platforming gameplay formula while combining elements from home console versions of the Mega Man X series. The player may choose to play each of a series of stages as either protagonist, X or Zero. Defeating the stage&#39;s boss will earn that player character its special weapon. Critical reception for Mega Man Xtreme 2 was lightly positive, with most reviewers giving the game praise typical of the long-running series and noting a general improvement over the first Mega Man Xtreme title. In 2013, Mega Man Xtreme 2 was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan&#39;s Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American eShop the following year and was released in the PAL region eShop in September 11, 2014.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-20T06:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cbf/cbfb1b35271bb8d6a9cb52105cf1d9c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 7, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
