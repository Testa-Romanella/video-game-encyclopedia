Were you play a day or multiple in the life of a renowned blacksmith. Your job is to go to sleep each day after acquiring some jobs posted on the job board. After you have done all the jobs for that job you can go back to sleep and acquire new jobs for the next day. Once you acquire a job you run through a series of steps and mini-games to craft the item in question for the job. Once you click on a job a piece of parchment will pop up and show you a list of things to do. From there you should start with the furnace looking image, then anvil, then water barrel, then oil barrel, then grindstone in that order. From there you can walk up to the \"front\" of any of the machines and interact with them with the 'e' key and start the mini-game. Each mini-game only uses the left mouse button so mess around until you get an idea for what happens. If you are confused about what to do in the mini-game you can press the 'h' key and get a little bit of in-game help. Once all the jobs on the job board have been 'x' out you must go back to bed by interacting with it with the 'e' key and go to sleep until the next day for new jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>***THERE IS NO SAVE SYSTEM***</strong></p>\n<p><strong>***ORDER: FURNACE&gt;ANVIL&gt;WATER&gt;OIL&gt;GRINDSTONE***</strong><br/></p>\n<p>H | In-game Help</p>\n<p>E | Interact</p>\n<p>WASD | Basic Movement</p>\n<p>LMB | Mini-game interaction</p>\n<p>ESC | Escape from the game</p>\n\n<p>*Tested in Windows version only: MAC, Linux at own risk*<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T05:22:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b4939baa98482fc9fce9cd020e02b074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SpoonsTheUtensil", "Kazuto455"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
