Repeat to load saved file. Check to see your inventory and status, as well as to escape to where all it started. A trauma is a poisoned anchor, after all.<br/></p>\n<p>The cycles must be repeated but the players may change, and the identities of the players will overlap and commingle. After all, when each day is a routine, how do you know that the second day is distinct from the first, or merely another instance of the same? How do you know that what you have done is or isn't the continuation of another?</p>\n<p>You try to see order, a single line, but order is a human perception.</p>\n<p><strong>New Moon</strong></p>\n<p>The cast have their titles borrowed from Sumerian literature. Theirs was a constantly changing timeline, their family tree a shifting quantic overlap, and their presence as observable as the electrons of an atom.</p>\n<p>But to be honest, the author was simply frustrated over several video games and wanted vengeance.</p>\n<p><strong>Waxing Crescent</strong></p>\n<p>Being a twine game, this story runs in html and javascript and must be played in a web browser. Please try the demo before buying the full game. It works well in Chrome, but in Internet Explorer it bugs for unknown reason. Not sure about Firefox. Safari used to be fine and must be tested again.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to testers who informed the author that the game doesn't always work. The author isn't very good at coding so they are still figuring this out. It will work eventually. Hopefully.</p>\n<p><strong>First Born</strong></p>\n<p>This game deals with death and abuse. Lines would change depending on your behaviors and phases, past or future. Many items may only find their use in another cycle. Undo button may be necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Log</strong></p>\n<p><em>Apr 19, 2016 - </em>The SheepSkulls_Demo.html tells where the demo ends, while Skull of Ram, Skull of Ewe - Demo.html makes a seamless loop. Either way, neither of them is the full version. SheepSkulls is from an older file however, and would have more typos.</p>\n<p><em>Feb 21, 2016 - </em>Twitched the demo so it ends before it branches off. </p>\n<p><em>Feb 15, 2016 -</em> Patched up an issue that barred several phases from reaching the demo's proper end.</p>\n<p><em>Feb 8, 2016</em> - Finished the third version of the demo. Inventory function is enabled, extending paths in demo.</p>\n<p><em>Jan 21, 2016</em> - Finished the second version of the demo. Save function is finally enabled.</p>\n<p><em>Jan 14, 2016</em> - Finished the first version of the demo.</p>\n<p><em>You let the coin fall into the river below.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9cb45a727520cf320e1b8a1f8ce2814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["halfphaseofthesun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
