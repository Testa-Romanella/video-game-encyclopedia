{"id": 626190, "slug": "mr-diamond", "name": "Mr Diamond", "name_original": "Mr Diamond", "description": "<p>This is a board game which produced in 1993 and has different names too! You could play with the computer too.\r\n </p>\n<p>Each player in turn tries to take a diamond. If it comes free, the player keeps it.\r\n </p>\n<p>It is a memory game because you have to remember where the fixed diamonds are to increase your chance to grab more diamonds.\r\n </p>\n<p>You could change how many cards or diamonds in this game.\r\n </p>\n<p>You could also change the color of the diamonds and board.\r\n </p>\n<p>So you could play it in any style you like.\r\n </p>\n<p>This game could play by 2 \u2013 8 players and takes about 20 minutes to finish the game.\r\n </p>\n<p>Suitable for age 8 and up.\r\n </p>\n<p>After selecting the card, you have to select a diamond and then you have to press your selected card.\r\n </p>\n<p>Computer shuffles cards and the game continues until cards finished or all diamonds picked.\r\n </p>\n<p>You could change some rules in the \u201csettings\u201d section.\r\n </p>\n<p>The computer plays very well and there is no easy level!\r\n </p>\n<p>Diamonds on other players' cards can be picked by grab card, but only those diamonds can be placed on a card that has the same price. For example, if you picked a player's diamond from his $3,000 card, you can only put it on your $3,000 card, not on other cards!\r\n </p>\n<p>If the grab card cannot be used, the player puts it out of the game and draws another card (the same, of course, would be done if the first card drawn in the game is a grab card). Grab cards have no value in themselves, and these are only usable for picking diamonds from other players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c69a12fb304c964a7931ff44eeaa77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["bdshahab"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
