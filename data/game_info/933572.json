The lecture hall is dimly lit, but a solitary sunbeam penetrates through the window and hits your empty paper pad on the desk. You begin to scribble various spaceships with a pen, and suddenly you dive into your childhood, where you loved space shooter games.</p>\n<p>With only three lives, you battle against four different types of\u00a0enemies, who try to defeat you in\u00a0increasing numbers. You feel the adrenaline coursing through your body as you dodge left and right and shoot with rapid fire. A health pack appears, and you grab it to improve your health. You are almost ready to break the high score when suddenly a hand taps your shoulder and brings you back to reality.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your professor turns to you and asks for the answer to his question. You answer in a much too loud tone, \"Three!\" The professor rolls their eyes and continues their equation. You gaze out the window and sigh, wishing you could dive back into the game.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>When you are in the main menu, you can choose whether to play in 2D or 3D mode by checking the corresponding box. Control your spaceship using the \"WASD\" keys and fire by pressing the \"spacebar\". Avoid enemies and their projectiles to avoid being hit. For each defeated enemy, you will receive points that will be credited to your high score. There are also three different power-ups (Health, Shield, Firerate) that can help you.</p>\n\r\nFuture\r\n<p>This project is still actively being developed. I would like to work on the following points in chronological order:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Complete the 3D mode and adapt it to the game's graphical style\r\n</li><li>Improve/revamp touch input for the mobile application\r\n</li><li>Fix known bugs, including:<ul><li>Incorrect Highscore displayed in the \"Game Over\" screen\r\n</li><li>Shooting audio sounding strange when the player moves far to the left (only Android .apk)</li></ul>\n</li><li>Add new enemies and power-ups\r\n</li><li>Publish the application on Android (Google Play) and iPhone (App Store) platforms</li></ul>\n\r\nContact\r\n<p>If you would like to learn more about my other projects or get in touch with me, please visit my website at </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T10:51:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dd7c09a151b86940c8d2f7924a57133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Theurer"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
