Looks like it's hammerin' time!</p>\n<p>This is a little something I\u00a0made for a friend, based on one of his recent art piece. This game is based on the Game &amp; Watch handheld lcd game \"Vermin\". Move left and right to align with Aster's head, and bang! Right on the kisser!</p>\n<p>How many hits can you land? ~</p>\n<p>Sneakers (c) EspressoSkoonk :\u00a0https://twitter.com/EspressoSkoonk<br/>Aster (c) Himself :\u00a0https://twitter.com/AsterTweets</p>\n<p>The left and right arrow keys move the player, or you can click or tap the left and right side of the screen. The bottom left button toggles fullscreen mode, and the bottom right button restarts the game, or starts a new game if the game just booted up.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:56:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b7915c03858d952aa17af55fec767a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David Jalbert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
