There are three possible states it can switch to, and you have to think quickly using the move you end up with at any moment.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think that this idea to utilize the theme wasn't the best. It certainly is somewhat creative, but it isn't always the most fun or engaging as I hoped.</p>\n<p>I do have 16 more hours till submission closes as of writing this, but I hope to spend at least 7 of those sleeping, and the rest either eating or doing things that mean I can't work on the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10fcd484e86b3e902757eedb82ce18e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PlayerTheMaker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
