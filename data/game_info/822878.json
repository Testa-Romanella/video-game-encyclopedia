{"id": 822878, "slug": "tremendous-acquisitions-alpha", "name": "Tremendous Acquisitions (Alpha)", "name_original": "Tremendous Acquisitions (Alpha)", "description": "<p>Tremendous Acquisitions is a Wizardry- or Might-and-Magic-style CRPG. I've wanted to make a game in this style for a long time, crossing old-school DRPG dungeon designs with a gamebook or CYOA. I stream development on the game every Saturday morning over at https://twitch.tv/rdominick.<br/></p>\n<p>The builds available here are early alphas. What is there is playable, and I believe I am on the right track, the game will probably change quite a bit. Current plans are for eight levels of increasingly-intricate dungeon delving, town and dungeon NPCs, shops and loot, a not-overwhelming number of quests, and a sequel hook.<br/></p>\n<p>The artwork in the game is by Better Legends, except for several placeholder textures -- you'll be able to tell which ones. Moss is a wonderful artist, and I'm so happy to have his art in the game.<br/></p>\n<p>For version release notes, see the devlog. Remember: for best results, new version, new game. A proper save-updating system is in the works. Please offer any feedback or bug reports you can, it helps greatly.<br/></p>\n<p>You can create your own party or use a set of 6 pregenerated characters.</p>\n<p> To heal characters, return to town via the staircase where you started and Rest. This will even bring dead characters back to life. They were just resting!<br/></p>\n<p>While in the dungeon, use W to move forward, A and S to turn to the left or right, and D to turn around. A minimap in the upper right will show your immediate surroundings. Press TAB to see the full map. Press Escape to see the System Menu.<br/></p>\n<p>Press a number key (1-6) to see that character's sheet. You can cast spells outside of combat there. Spells that start with \"-\" have not been implemented yet. Spells cost HP to cast -- and yes, you can cast yourself unconscious!<br/></p>\n<p>If there is something to interact with in a room, words in the room description will be highlighted in blue. Click on them to interact.<br/></p>\n<p>In combat, all characters start set to \"Attack A\". Use the number keys 1-6 to assign actions to characters or F to fight for one round. Your entire party will go first, in order, and then all monsters. All fights are to the DEATH. Oh, there's a Run option there, it just doesn't work yet.<br/></p>\n<p>** Asterisks ** around a character's class and level mean they are ready to level up. Exit the dungeon and stay at the Inn to level your party.</p>\n<p>The game autosaves at (very) frequent intervals -- roughly every step in the dungeon. It also finalizes the save when you Quit. TPK? You can just Continue from the main menu like it never happened. (Better luck next time.)<br/></p>\n<p>The System Menu has a couple of debug options, both in town and in the dungeon, useful for if you get stuck or want to fight a boss battle over again.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T19:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77f7e8365a445585c60e75312b346403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rdominick"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
