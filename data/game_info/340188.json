It is a company formed by 2 people. A programmer and a designer who always dreamed of being able to make a video game! One day I decided to participate in a national Olympic Games in Argentina and after 3 months of constant work and a lot of love in the project, I managed to get the first place in this competition. -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------ Today, we find ourselves with the ambition of being able to take it to mobile platforms such as Andriod and iOS, but we need the help of the community, with innovative ideas to advance the game. Since it is intended to be presented in a contest and not for the public free of charge.</p>\n<p>For what we have so far, is to make the levels are more extensive, but adding features that have faces.</p>\n<p>For this, we will be available 2 links in our forum. One of the original game and another game with updates and modifications that we believe, too, for you.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and we hope to receive many comments.</p>\n<p>Our character \"Leen\", in this search for the pieces of a puzzle that make up a flag.
