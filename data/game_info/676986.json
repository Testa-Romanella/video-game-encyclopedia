Take turns playing a card - each card has a value that gets added to the bomb's value when played.\u00a0When the bomb's value goes beyond 10 or below 0, the bomb explodes on whoever last played the card!! They are then eliminated and the remaining players continue until there is only 1 left.<br/></p>\n<p>Every player gets the same deck of 8 cards:<br/>[-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5]<br/>This deck is randomly shuffled at the start of the game - at the start of the first turn, player draws 3 cards into their hand. Every turn they choose one of the three cards in their hand to play, picking up a new card at the start of each turn.<br/><br/>Btw...\u00a0This a jam game - our netcode was done in a weekend. If you try to break it, you'll probably succeed<br/>Also note: To play online with friends, download the windows or mac build.
