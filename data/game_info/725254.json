Complete with a tutorial level you will find cherries and gems that will help you by giving you extra lives if you collect enough of them. This being my first project, for now there are some common mechanics that may not be coded in such as variable jump, and the assets of course are recycled, However the game is fluid and its level design proper with no game breaking bugs, but tons of small secrets and areas to find.
