The Interstellar Parcel Service or IPS short takes advantage of a natural phenomenon called wormholes. These spectacular looking objects connect two points in spacetime and pave the way for IPS most successful service. Faster than light delivery.<br/></p>\n<p>As a young navigator, you will join the ranks of the IPSs delivery fleet to traverse a procedurally generated galaxy, evading and fighting enemies to deliver parcels to the far corners of the inhabited space.</p>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Procedurally generated game world</li><li>Turn-based movement and battle system</li><li>Permadeath\u00a0</li><li>3 difficulty levels</li><li>Ship upgrade system</li></ul>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCamera Movement\r\n\t\t\tWASD / Arrow Keys / Right Mouse Button\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tZoom\r\n\t\t\tMouse Scroll Wheel\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tEnd Turn\r\n\t\t\tSpace\u00a0\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tLock / Unlock camera from the player ship\r\n\t\t\tQ\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tPlayer Movement / Interaction\r\n\t\t\tLeft Mouse Button\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tPause Menu\r\n\t\t\tESC\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Play on easy. Trust me it's alreadey brutal.</li><li>Don't skip the tutorial. You will start with 2 rather easy delivery orders which will allow an early upgrade for your ship.</li><li>You're on a dilivery ship not a destroyer. In most cases running is the better option than fighting.</li><li>Most enemies will not follow through worm holes. Only the Hunter type will track you through the whole galaxy after it sensed you.</li><li>The same galaxy name will result in the same generated galaxy. So you can try to remember where the worm holes lead.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6cb8c1e6f091d06f2157b8401f3ee80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vi7o"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
