The disappearing platforms are a double edged sword, offering opportunities to shove enemies into the void but also restricting your own movement</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/></p>\n<p>Z to undo, R to restart<br/></p>\n<p>ESC to open pause screen</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Code: VortexB</p>\n<p>Art: Huetimes3<br/></p>\n<p>Level Design: VortexB, Huetimes3</p>\n<p>Special thanks to jnnwn#0590 for her awesome fanart!
