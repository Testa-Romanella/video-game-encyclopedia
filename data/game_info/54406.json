It was first released in Japan on February 5, 1999, and was later released in North America on December 22, 1999.<br />\nNatsume initially stated bringing it to Wii U Virtual Console was not possible due to unknown technical issues, despite the Wii proving the task to be possible through homebrew emulation. However, in celebration of the series&#39; twentieth anniversary, the game abruptly saw release on the Wii U Virtual Console on February 23, 2017. This also marked the game&#39;s debut in the PAL regions (the original had been cancelled due to time constraints), as well as the game&#39;s first official re-release (as well as the first time digital) in nearly two decades.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "1999-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T15:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b72263f2c59a71eb5ae39ffb8e6ce175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 8, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64", "Wii U"], "developers": ["Victor Interactive Software", "Marvelous Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Natsume"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
