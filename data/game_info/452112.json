The original idea for the game was to be stylized like Mario Bros, with levels being single screens and being less so about level design and more so about enemies and managing both the enemies and graffiti and also didn't include the rising water. Sadly things didn't come out as planned due to time and us losing members and having to find members.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7ef07bceab01f501926eee1ac8d8f36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radical Red"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
