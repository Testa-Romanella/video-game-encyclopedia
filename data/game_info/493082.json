They are throwing the candy to you from their second floor window and you must catch it!<br/>- A and D to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- If you catch the candy in the air +2 points, if you let it hit the ground +1 point(Because no one likes ground candy, but hey it's still candy!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Green House</strong>: It seems no one is home? Or is this just a haunted maze? Either way, see if you can't find where they are stashing that good stuff!<br/>- Mouse to move the camera\u00a0</p>\n<p>- WASD to move your player.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blue House</strong>: Is this some sort of cruel trick?! This house seems to think Apples are a good candy! Luckily it seems their rebellious teen is helping you out by tossing candy as well!<br/>-A and D to move</p>\n<p>-Space to throw a Bat(okay the graphic looks messed up)</p>\n<p>- You'll want to hit away the apples, while letting the candy fall to safety behind you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Orange House:</strong> Why, I've never seen anything like this, is it a construction zone?\u00a0<br/>-A and D to move side to side</p>\n<p>-SPACE to jump up. Maybe there's candy at the top?</p>\n\n<p>Update: After finally playing it in WebGL as opposed to windows build - hot dang things get compressed and such for WebGL, I'm sorry everyone, it looks nicer/smoother on windows build</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc1f1185063d388b5283bc7bc231fe89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeiAfkpuz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
