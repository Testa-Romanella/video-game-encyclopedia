An array of difficulties stand in your way: field space is limited, your satchel of seeds is jumbled up, and soil quality can grant rapid growth or slow maturation to a snail's pace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Careful planning just as important as good timing, and only a clever farmer can truly make a bountiful harvest from every field.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>High-Octane Reaping and Sowing:</strong> lay down rows of plants with just a single swipe of the mouse.</li><li><strong>Strategic Scoring:</strong> find ways to extend your chains of crops to secure the highest multiplier possible.</li><li><strong>Gold Stars:</strong> just like in preschool days of yore, get rewarded for a job well done with gold stars! Even when there are no more stars left to get, you're free to compare your high scores with your friends and enemies.</li></ul>\n<p>Jump into the action right away if you're tired of reading, otherwise venture onward for additional information and occasional witticisms.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Click the mouse, press Spacebar, or press 'z' to switch between *Planting* and *Harvesting* modes (represented by a green bag of seeds and a sickle, respectively)</p>\n<p>Move your mouse over an empty field while in *Planting* mode to place a seed. Later, move the mouse over that field in *Harvesting* mode to reap the crop &amp; score points.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Crops can be harvested as soon as they finish sprouting, but the greatest rewards (both score and multiplier growth) come from harvesting ripened crops.</li><li>Harvesting several of the same crop in a row (a \"Chain\" of crops) exponentially increases your progress toward the next level of multiplier. There's no direct difference in score because of a chain, but reaching a higher multiplier is essential for achieving high scores!</li><li>The crop combo multiplier will decay over time. Planting a few crops can stall the timer temporarily and harvesting plants of any quality might help. Harvesting fully ripened crops is the only surefire way to refresh it, though.</li><li>Planning ahead is your greatest asset - check the list of crops at the bottom of the screen for the order and count of each type that will appear in the level. The three crop-badges on the left side of the screen change dynamically show the next three crops that are ready to be planted.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>Farming Combos</em> was created with the Godot engine in 72 hours and includes original code, sound, and art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full team included:</p>\n<ul><li>@Doctor_Zeus - lead designer, programmer, misc. goalpost-moving</li><li>Noah Bumgardner - designer, programmer, composer</li><li>Alex Mullins - artist, created the harvest / plant symbols and crop-tile graphics</li><li>Tom Bumgardner - artist, made a painting for the thumbnail / menu screens</li></ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n<p>The lovely pixel-art tileset used for the background of the levels was purchased in an asset pack:</p>\n<p>7Soul's RPG Graphics - Tiles - Grasslands</p>\n<p>by Henrique \"7Soul\" Lazarini - @7SoulDesign</p>\n<p>And we also relied upon the *Roboto* font, created by Christian Robertson\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given their external source, please don't consider them when rating our team's artistic work (the rest of which was made within the confines of the jam).</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback Wanted</strong></p>\n<p>This Ludum Dare entry features original art, music, and gameplay, and we are welcome to all kinds of feedback, especially related to how fun *Farming Combos* is to play!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also check out the open-source code on GitHub\u00a0(gaze upon our spaghetti, ye Mighty, and despair!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:39:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7edccc77374b4028003fe27bdd303fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NBumgardner", "sbumgardner"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
