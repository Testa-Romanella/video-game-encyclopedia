The game was made as part of a time-limited 7 month project, and functions more like a proof-of-concept or demo than a fully fledged game, and we would like for as many people to be able to play it as possible. Please feel free to leave feedback and ratings based on this, and we appreciate the time anyone spends playing our game. :)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T03:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbaaca396033f0702819edb2f9edb122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Usual Suspects"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Usual Suspects"], "esrb_rating": null}
