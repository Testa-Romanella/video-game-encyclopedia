Pressing SPACE will exit a circle in a straight line. You do not have control as long as you are not in a circle. Travel the longest distance to get the highest score.<br/></p>\n<p>Things missing in the 3h version:<br/>\u00a0- score<br/>\u00a0- collision detection on the snake<br/>- more levels<br/>WARNING: Close the 3h version after you finished playing! Don't let it run in background or just leave it open!<br/></p>\n<p>Updated version is up! Took around 5.5h ... 3h is harder then I imagined ... next time! ^^<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Clarko (https://collision-check.itch.io/) for helping me to find an idea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:32:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924f0af3422e15adf35be1d50e231020.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["[Tyr|x]"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
