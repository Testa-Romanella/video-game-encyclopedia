The versions used to be consistent with each other but not anymore. You must find these differences and fix them. </p>\n<p>Your left eye and right eye are hooked up to two different versions of the Mutrix. Look for abnormalities and use your eyes to check if they exist in both version. If you spot a difference you must put the abnormality in the center of both your eyes, even if only one of your eyes can see it. Then get in range and use your difference fixer. The difference should be fixed and will now appear in both versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Move Mouse</strong> to rotate head horizontally<br/><strong>Hold Left Click</strong> to rotate left eye in all directions<br/><strong>Hold Right Click</strong> to rotate right eye in all directions</p>\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> to move your character<br/><strong>Space</strong> to jump<br/><strong>E</strong> to use the difference fixer<br/><strong>Q</strong> to reset eyes rotation (A bit buggy, only resets it temporary until you hit any mouse left or right)</p>\n<p>The .exe version is a bit prettier and a bit more stable then the browser version.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 37 Compo, my first one.</p><p><strong>Source<br/></strong>https://github.com/e4lime/ludum-dare-37-mutrix<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changelog <strong>for v1.1 </strong><br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed the reset eyes rotation bug</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bc039ca4b0b62ab1243a0d00f1107a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["e4lime"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
