The player must learn how to properly progress in their farm, as each soil has different properties and watering needs, and monsters can only be defeated with a sword made of a mineral that is as hard as the monster or harder. My partners and I worked directly with a third grade class to create this game. The learning topics of the game were provided by the teacher, and the students supplied the idea and name of the game.</p>\n<p><em>Farm.io\u00a0</em>is designed to be played in a single class session (~30 minutes)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Use Item: Q or E</p>\n<p>Interact with Objects: Click</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T08:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d2e9f1e28c9838c5fa61a63a9ac004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kelsey Wimberley"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
