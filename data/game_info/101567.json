{"id": 101567, "slug": "proxima-b-2", "name": "Proxima B", "name_original": "Proxima B", "description": "<p>\r\n\t Proxima B was made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare game jam, and was originally released in August 2016. It's a top down shooter set on a distant planet. You crash land to find the remnants of an ancient civilisation, with most of the defence system still operating. You need to find the parts to repair a derelict alien ship and escape the planet's surface.<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 36, and the theme was Ancient Technology. We wanted to go for a sci-fi feel, and liked the idea of discovering ancient alien technology on a distant planet. It took us a while to get going in this game jam, and the time pressure meant we went for something fairly traditional. The level design and shooting mechanics could have been a lot better, but overall we still managed to get something fairly polished in the time limit.<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Gamepad \u2013 Left stick to move, Right stick to aim. Right trigger to shoot, A button to interact and X button to dodge.<br/>\r\n\t Keyboard \u2013 WASD to Move, Mouse to Aim, Left-click to shoot. Spacebar is dodge and E is interact.<br/>\n<em>(Note: This game also supports various European keyboard layouts such as ESDF, ZASD and ZQSD)</em><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnly the aliens respawn between screens, so try taking out the robots first. You will do much better with an upgraded weapon, so try exploring a bit. You will need to carry all the ship parts all the way back to the start, which is very tedious. This isn't very good and we're sorry, but that's what happens when you make a game in 3 days!\r\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/406557ebf6169b1e8d42dd235c238fe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
