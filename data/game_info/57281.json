The total of these determines which text is displayed when the game is finished. The dogfights make the game more diverse and the cheat options e.g. ability to destroy buildings with the chain gun give variety. Lots of optional targets to destroy on the open map too but take too long and you fail the mission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Opus"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["System 3", "SETA"], "esrb_rating": null}
