So I sprinkled them around the levels, you can pick them up to buy new weapons, or more time.</p>\n<p>The game's pretty imbalanced unfortunately, but I had some fun making it.</p>\n<p>P.S. Pay no mind to the awful pixel art made by me haha</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading !\u00a0Have fun and let me know what you think :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/314fbdbaba750cc7e4908aca24abde14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["the_Law_1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
