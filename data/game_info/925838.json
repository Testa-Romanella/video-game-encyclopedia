Failing to do so will make the car slow down. If you're\u00a0lucky, you can still reach the checkpoint. On your way you'll encounter\u00a0many other cars. I suggest you try not to hit them.<br/>Completing all stages will earn you absolutely nothing, except the\u00a0sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>The time limit is pretty tight. Make thoughtful use of the turbo boost\u00a0which will pretty much double the torque output of your fancy prancing\u00a0horse. Don't use it too much, because your temperature gauge will rise\u00a0pretty quickly. Choose the auto transmission or the 2 speed to get a more forgiving time limit.</p>\n<p>The car is controlled with the arrow keys (sorry, no aswd controls), but an Xbox controller is highly recommended.</p>\n<strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Xbox controller</strong><strong>Throttle:</strong>UPRight trigger<strong>Brake:</strong>DOWNLeft trigger<strong>Steering:</strong>LEFT &amp; RIGHTLeft joystick<strong>Upshift:</strong>Q (or A maybe?)A button<strong>Downshift:</strong>W (or Z maybe?)X button<strong>Turbo boost:</strong>SPACEY button<em>Manual clutch:</em>Right joystick down\r\n<p>This game is a work in progress. Well, should be. I wanted to make this prototype prettier, but my hard drive with all the game files on it\u00a0failed. Retrieving the data will cost me around \u20ac1000. All donations will be used to fund the retrieval of the data on that hard drive, so I can continue developing this game.</p><p>Wonder why there are a lot of bus signs? Well, this game was supposed to be a Desert Bus remake. And when I changed my mind, this sign was the only sprite I had to put next to the road and it never left.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T09:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95f45a3ac7feb2e0052668c7b81a1742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sk1ds"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
