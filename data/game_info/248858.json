It will not be updated as the app is here to honour the older iOS versions (where SmallFish was initially developed). ***<br/><br/>*** Download this app if you're interested how SmallFish worked in the old days. ***<br/><br/>*** This is the iOS 6 version for SmallFish, more suitable for the older devices. Please download the latest version (search \"SmallFish\" on AppStore) if you have later iOS installed. ***<br/><br/>SmallFish is an open source project based on the Stockfish chess engine. It uses the latest Stockfish chess engine (Stockfish 4.0), rated about Elo 3230+ and is therefore one of the strongest chess apps.<br/><br/>The app derives from the SmallChess app (another top chess app) to create stunning chess playing experience for absolutely no cost! The strongest chess app is free, something very hard to believe but it's true.<br/><br/>SmallFish offers you three distinct ways to improve your game. You can review your game with comments, or study how Stockfish thinks, or track your progress. You can also control the internal engine parameters.<br/><br/>The interface is an example of a \"flatten\" design - dropping of heavy textures and the addition of several new simple user interface elements. <br/><br/>SmallFish is simply amazing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c79374ddf34df940d6507d7327c197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ted Wong"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Ted Wong"], "esrb_rating": null}
