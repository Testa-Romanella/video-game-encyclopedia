You want to find an elusive rare bird in the forest and snap its picture. You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.<br />\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game, one of the best-rated horror titles on itch, and one of Rock, Paper, Shotgun&#39;s best games of 2018.<br />\nA narrative, horror tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.<br />\nCutting between numerous detailed and varied vignettes, unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.<br />\nExplore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.<br />\nA leisurely playthrough should take forty five minutes give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimey low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you&#39;d prefer.<br />\nOver an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis &amp; sampling akin to a haunted recollection of 90s Unreal Engine soundtracks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/596/596d821b3c0cd01b27773f07b99ff737.jpg", "website": "http://www.arbitrarymetric.com", "rating": 3.53, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 64, "owned": 756, "beaten": 73, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 7, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 82, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 83, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Arbitrary Metric", "ArbitraryMetric"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arbitrary Metric"], "esrb_rating": null}
