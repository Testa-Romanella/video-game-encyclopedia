At this point in your adventure,\r\n        there's no way for you to fight back.\u00a0Unfortunately, it seems your discovery has attracted the attention\r\n        of the cavern's locals...</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>\r\n        Your wounds will bleed periodically, and you're out of healing supplies.\r\n        Every time you ascend stairs, your bleeding will become more frequent.</p>\n<p>\r\n        Monsters can smell blood from any distance, and they'll go slurp up the\r\n        nearest pool. If they see movement, however, they'll give chase.</p>\n<p>\r\n        Standing still makes you harder to see. Monsters will only attack you if\r\n        they are right next to you while you're standing still.</p>\n<p>If you stand\r\n        still in water, they can't see you at all.\u00a0Any blood that falls into water will be washed away.\u00a0As you move further out through the cave, the space opens up. You'll\r\n        also encounter larger pools of water.\u00a0</p>\r\nDesign Thinking\r\n<p>\r\n        I am interested in roguelike games that are less strategic,\r\n        and more tactical. Strigoi explores a game system in which\r\n        the player's only tools are their movement and their environment. There are no resources to manage or dice to roll.</p>\n<p>\r\n        Inspired by moments in 3D stealth games where you must wait with bated\r\n        breath as a search pursuer runs past you, I wanted to explore situations\r\n        where stealth was an option, and 'not moving' was a tactical choice.\r\n      </p>\n<p>\r\n        I also wanted to explore storytelling through player actions. You'll\r\n        learn more about the monster by being close to it, more about your\r\n        wounds by being wounded, and more about your story through\r\n        advancement.</p>\r\n7DRL\r\n<p>This game was submitted as part of the 7DRL 2020 game jam.\u00a0The 7DRL challenge is a 15-year long annual game jam.
