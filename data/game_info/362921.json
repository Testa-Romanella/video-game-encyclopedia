Accounts of the legend vary, but one consistent element of the story is that the spirit will ask the individual using the toilet a question.<br/>According to legend, if a person is sitting on a toilet in a public or school bathroom, Aka Manto will ask them if they want red paper or blue paper. Depending on the version of the story, the spirit may ask them to choose between a red cloak and a blue cloak, or between a red cape and a blue cape. If they choose the \"red\" option, they will be lacerated in such a manner that their dead body will be drenched in their own blood. The specific manner in which the person is lacerated differs depending on the account of the legend, from the person being stabbed or flayed, to their throat being slit or their head being decapitated. If the individual chooses the \"blue\" option, the consequences range from that person being strangled to all of the person's blood being drained from their body.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>PSX/PS1 aesthetic: Gives nostalgia and for some, it adds to the horror experience.<br/>Survival horror - The enemy will constantly hunt you while you explore the environment.<br/>Explore - Navigate through claustrophobic hallways.<br/>Atmosphere - Abandoned Japanese school that will haunt you all the time.<br/>Enemy - Run and hide.
