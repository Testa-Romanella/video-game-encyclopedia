As an agent of the great gacha rebellion, you ought to fix this, but as a being existing in the age of luck all the same, you have no choice but to beat them at their own game. Traverse three exciting areas, collect dices to bypass the numbered gates, collect golden dices to upgrade your own potential, and use the power of the Probabilikey to unlock Gacha Lord Genshin's last domain: Dice Castle. May you succeed in restoring this world to its proper deterministic state.\" - Game Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/3361a89a63debc3f772da0a340f61beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordinne"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
