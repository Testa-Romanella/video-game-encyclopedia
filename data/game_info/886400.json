Guide the protagonist through the mazes while avoiding the various denizens that inhabit the strange dimension of Magento. The protagonist can die one of three ways: by having their lives reduced to zero by colliding with any of the denizens of the Maze; by exhausting all of their magic orb\u00a0 ammo; or by running out of time to complete the Maze level.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Movement:W,A,S,D</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fire Magic Orb: Space Bar<br/></strong></p>\n<p>All assets, including pixel art and music/sound effects were created specifically for this project, with the exception of Magento's evil laugh, which was provided via SoundEffectsFactory: http://bit.ly/1eZd17n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/676/6764cbffa1f33fdea25736503b6c1c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Substance5271"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
