Some are better than others, but it is interesting to note that each game increases in quality as time goes on.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI wanted to make all these games available somewhere, so they don't rot on my hard drive forever, so here you go! Of course, some are better than others for sure. But some of them are actually really well done and fun to play, and I want the games to be played like they were meant to be, when I made them.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso, I wanted to distribute the source as well. It can be a very important learning opportunity for somebody who wants to learn Game Maker. There are a lot of different styles of games here, and the code could be a very helpful example for a novice.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>THE GAMES:<br/>\n</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Turtlez: from gm48 #7, the first one I competed in. The theme was \"Evolution\", so in this game you must run around, breeding your turtle with other turtles in order to keep blending in with the ever-changing background. I don't know what gods of luck where smiling on me this day, but this game won first place!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Turret: from gm48 #8. The theme was \"Minimal\", so you literally just point your mouse to shoot. It can get quite intense!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tymer: from gm48 #9. The theme was \"One Minute\". In this game you only have a minute for each level, but you can slow down time to help you get past the gruesome obstacles.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Wahfulz: from gm48 #10. The theme was \"Guns That Don't Shoot Bullets\". While at first I hated the theme, I dragged up an old idea I had in the back of my mind about a puzzle game where you shoot little white blobs at waffles. It turned out pretty nicely!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Vampirism: from gm48 #11. The theme was \"Stealth\". In this game, you play as a vampire who goes around sucking blood to stay alive. But be careful if you bite around other people!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Assassin: from gm48 #13. The theme was \"Death is useful\". I didn't really have any ideas, so I made a generic shooter-platformer. I liked it, and it can be quite challenging.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Crusader: from gm48 #14. The theme was \"Top Down ______\". This is one of my personal favorites. You drive a tank through Vietnam, bringing AMERICAN FREEDOM to all those commies!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Meteor Storm: from gm48 #15. The theme was \"Endless\". In this deceivingly simply game, you must run left and right to dodge the incoming meteors! You can also collect powerups to make the game more interesting.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Timber: from gm48 #16. The theme was \"Environment as a Weapon\". I thought this one was a lot of fun as well. You take weapons from your environment and use them to fight your way through 3 levels. I also particularly like the music for this one.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Floor 62: from gm48 #19. This is hands-down the best game I made for all the gm48s I've competed in. The theme was \"Only One Level\", so I made a murder-mystery detective game. You have to comb the 62nd floor of a private hotel, finding evidence about why the owner was murdered. Then present the evidence to the suspects, to try and get them to crack! There is a lot more depth to this game than you'd expect. There are WAY too many endings to count! This game also won first place.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Ten Minute Test: made for gm48 #20. The theme was \"Risk and Reward\". In this game, you have to cheat on your final exam using four different methods. But if the teacher catches you, it's game over!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Abyss: made for gm48 #22. The theme was \"Descend\". So I made a scuba-diving game, where you need to manage your air and health, while using your trusty harpoon to fight off the vicious sea creatures! By some crazy stroke of luck, this game won first place as well!</strong></li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tAll the games are compiled into one ZIP folder.
