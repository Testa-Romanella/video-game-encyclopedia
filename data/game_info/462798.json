It involves a group of friends going on a wacky adventure to get home, having to traverse bright, colorful environments in a strange dimension.\u00a0The game's soundtrack was composed by<strong><em>\u00a0RRThiel,\u00a0A-S-H,\u00a0Scooblee,\u00a0CosmicGem,\u00a0Mr.Sauceman,\u00a0[c],\u00a0MiniMacro,\u00a0Crash,\u00a0littlelamp100,\u00a0Woofle,\u00a0\u00a0Lange,\u00a0MegaBaZ,\u00a0SoundCirclet (dante) and\u00a0R3tronau</em></strong>t. However please note that most of the sound effects and a certain music track do not belong to us.</p>\n<p>Originally, the game started life as a tech demo for a future project. This game was made in Construct 2 and is completely free to download. Currently the game is available for Windows, though I may release other versions as well.</p>\n<p>The game includes 3 separate campaigns with their own levels and story, which include:<br/>-The \"<em>Dream Campaign</em>\", the main campaign with 4 levels, each split into 2 sections.<br/>-The <em>Original Campaign</em>, which contains the first ever level made for the original tech demo.<br/>-The \"<em>ULTRAMEGA Campaign</em>\", which contains multiple challenging levels, 2 of which being based off the game \"<strong>MEGAMAN PERFECT BLUE</strong>\", a fan project lead by RRThiel.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game I have spent the past year and a half creating. It was definitely a great learning experience for me, and I hope you'll continue to support my work when I begin creating my next big project.</p>\n<p><em>(The current version is v1.0.1.
