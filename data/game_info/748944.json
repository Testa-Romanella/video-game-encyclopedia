You are going to need to work your way up the pack with style and grace. And a little bit of well-timed aggression, because the <strong>AI is very competitive</strong>!</p>\n<p>The main event is the <strong>campaign mode</strong>, where you try to become champion by collecting the most points while racing <strong>procedurally generated tracks</strong> through various worlds, but beware - if you <strong>damage your car too much, it's all over</strong>.</p>\n<p>There's also a <strong>time trial mode</strong>, with <strong>ghost cars</strong> from both your best run, and the developer's par record. Are you better than me? Only one way to find out!</p>\n<p>This game is best played using a gamepad with analog controls. Keyboard and steering wheels are also supported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/786/7860f90905c7e346ab790ccfcab30196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["properlydecent"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
