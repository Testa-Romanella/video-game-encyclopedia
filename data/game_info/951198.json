Axel's interaction with everyone is so adorable, especially with the HQ boys!</p>\n<p>hiyoko(\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): My favorite is Altare! He treats every customers with gentleness, and he has endless tolerance towards his buddies. He's always the first to stand up\u00a0when the coffee shop runs into any trouble. I love our leader\u2665</p>\n<p>CathycathyK.(\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): idk how to write recommendation lmao</p>\n<p>Enin(\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605): I like Hakka! He looks like a naughty boy, but he actually behaves in front of the elders. The only guy he picks on is Bettel, but Bettel is also Hakka's favorite. When ever Bettel gets himself into trouble, Hakka rushes to his rescue or tries to comfort him. Even if they gets into fights, Hakka would sneak into his bedroom and put Bettel's favorite dessert on his desk. God that's adorable</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T19:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b09858fc8a72a1571bfe0f5e712b449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Roxfreeze"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
