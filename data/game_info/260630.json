The \u2018ships\u2019 that would be found throughout the game were going to be skyscrapers with rockets strapped to them, hence the elevators. Despite what the preview may look like, this was a side-on perspective platformer, like elevator action. Most of the time in this project went towards procedurally generating the buildings/ships. This is on hiatus which is probably indefinite.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>E: Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b59/b59e31b48ebd3dbedb00573350bc67d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blstrManx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
