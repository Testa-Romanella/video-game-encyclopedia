You find yourself all alone, in the middle of a dark forest. You have no weapons and no place to wait for help. The dim flashlight that lights the way is your only friend. Your goal is to explore the area to find eight pages and escape from this terrifying place. <br/><br/><strong>Levels</strong><br/>In the main menu you can choose from three available levels. Dense Jungle, Winter Forest or Swamp. Whatever you choose, darkness, dense fog and a frightening atmosphere await you in any case.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dangers</strong><br/>As you wander through the dark forest, you might see a bright light somewhere in the distance or hear strange noises like the hiss of a broken television set. You don't need to check what it is. You're better off just running. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Pages</strong><br/>In order to complete the level you need to find eight pictures. Usually in games like this, players have to look for notes or some scary drawings, but this is a little different. I just took some pictures of my cat and added them to the game. To complete the level, you have to find all of her pictures.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T03:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33acf5ab20d7d0e13f815e348e1f96c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wombat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["wombat games"], "esrb_rating": null}
