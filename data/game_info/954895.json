Typically this will be your <strong>attack</strong> button.<br/>- <strong>Shift</strong> uses the item in the left hand. By default, this is the pearl, which transports you between <strong>two worlds</strong>. A door may be locked in one world, but don't let that stop you.<br/>- Number keys (1-4) can be used to swap between UI tabs.<br/>- The . key is a modifier that, if held, allows some extra shortcuts and options. For example, (Y) equips items, but (.+Y) unequips them. (.+Up/Down) also scrolls the text log.<br/>- The mouse can be used to use items (left click) or drop (right click). You can also hold to drag things into the ground slot area to drop them, or to slots in your equipment tab.<br/><br/><strong>Technical support</strong><br/>- Runs vastly better for me in Chrome than in Firefox.<br/>- Try downloading the Windows x64 version, otherwise. It runs about the same as on Chrome for me.<br/><br/><strong>Submission details<br/></strong>-  Theme: Duality. There are two sides to this island, and all things are interrelated.<br/>- Made in one week in <em>Construct 3</em>. Some assets are reused from a previous jam game. A lot of underlying systems work for the the inventory/UI and text log, was made for use across multiple projects.<br/>- Asset disclosure: Some assets were made before the jam, as placeholders I did not have time to redraw. The empty player hand and knife were used in a previous game, \"Wayne's World 3\". Some other placeholder art/UI icons carried over from the aforementioned systems work, save/load icons, etc. I made the typefaces years ago. Sound effects were purchased for use from GameDev Market. A license is available here.<br/>- The FoV is quite low. The jam guidelines made a big point about that, but it was a conscious choice to get more up in the face of the characters you converse with and to use the minimap, log, and UI floor inventory to get a better sense of what's going on around you. It can be a little awkward sometimes though, admittedly, and whether it was the right choice in the end is for others like you to say.<br/>- The game has an ending! Can you find it?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things I didn't get done on time<br/></strong>- The top third or so of the islands is completely barren. There's basically no reason to go up there, past the museum/castle.<br/>- More varied map/tile art, non-cube shapes, room furnishings.<br/>- More throwaway violent enemies and reasons to fight them. More interesting combat with more use for the offhand weapon/item slot.<br/>- A lot of systems work.<br/><br/>Credits<br/>- This game was not made by me alone. I have many cool people to thank.<br/>- Additional character art (and a certain player hand animation) provided by Jason (@mydadisdracula), Luke (@lukehumphris), Keith (@keithito), Chris Rosier.<br/>- Music by Andrew de Koning.<br/>- Additional support from Ben (@lecithin) (who named the game), and Justin Boyd.<br/>- Thanks to Luke also for curating many sounds for the project, plus some tileset art I didn't have time to add.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c039a674eb00bb4624b9446472832491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Zackarotto"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
