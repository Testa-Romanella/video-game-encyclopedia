We can remote control robots to complete tasks. But it's dangerous too. As a result, we can only send commands to the robot in advance and release the connection for 10 seconds until next connection.</p>\n<p>So in the game, you need to choose serveral actions in advance for the robot to do in next 10 seconds, and do the same thing every 10 seconds when protecting your own battery and defending enemies.</p>\n<p>The \"queue\" thing means all robots(yours and enemies) act one action by one action and one by one, according to the action queue. The robot may face some unpredictable scene. If you have ever played board game \"Colt Express\", it will be more clear.</p>\n<p>So, please try your best to think more in the just 10 SECONDS for the pathetic robot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c198548becfd50b55a14c36f872f943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["shuimen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
