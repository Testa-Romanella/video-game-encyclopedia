Ray-Marching is a\u00a0rendering method that employs a Signed Distance Function that calculates the distance between the camera (you) and the scene (the shape, in this case). If the SDF is made to take into account 4 axes instead of the usual 3, it will visualize shapes as seen on the program (four dimensions, baby!!)<br/></p>\n<p>The logic behind what is put on the screen follows the Cross-Sections analogy as described by Edwin Abbott in his novel \"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions\". Basically, if 2D beings were to observe a 3D object move through the flat plane they live in, they would only see a two-dimensional cross section of it at any given time (picture: apple slices, or an MRI scan -- a 2D being would only see one slice at a time, changing in shape and size as the object moves and rotates. A diagonal cut of an apple looks different from a horizontal cut!). Following such logic, if a 3D being was to\u00a0observe a 4D object moving through its space, it would only see a three-dimensional cross section of it at any given time.\u00a0 That's it, really. Now you know how to spot a 4-dimensional being!
