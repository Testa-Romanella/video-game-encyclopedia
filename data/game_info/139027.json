Not a ton to see at first glance but hopefully it'll at least be somewhat entertaining and I hope you enjoy it! Note: This project is being developed on RPG Maker so, many of the resources are rather bland/generic. I've done some researching and found programs I'd like to eventually obtain to overhaul/revamp the game with but, cannot afford them at the moment. Anyone willing to help donate to the cause, even if it's just a few pennies will be very appreciated. If not, that's ok as well, my biggest concern is just wanting to share this and help entertain others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0efbffc4c4d9f5f19cf92d6810ee202b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rancid Hyena"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
