I used music by Jemeza and sound effects by Bubbaproducer but otherwise the art, programming, and design were all done by me. Please give me your feedback about what you think about this game and how it might be improved. I would like to try to make this a mobile game someday but for now I have had a lot of fun making it and I'm happy to move on to new things. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/338a7e76175349a6a8540a50aea5bcd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OccamsLazer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
