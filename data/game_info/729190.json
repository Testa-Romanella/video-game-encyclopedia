A top down action-rpg style roguelike made for the Mini Jam 98 Game Jam. This was a huge learning experience, as I (Fonics, Programmer + Art) had never worked with animating 3D characters before. For my last few jams I've done 2D, so this was a big challenge. Due to a few unfortunate circumstances the time lost made the initial vision for the game, albeit small, impossible to properly complete. So here we are! It's playable, and it is in fact a video game. But I would consider this a prototype rather than any kind of finished product. The music and sfx done by Chipper (https://emcd.bandcamp.com/) are top-notch though, so at least while you deal with the game jam jank you can listen to some awesome music!</p>\n\n<p>Quick tips:\r\n</p>\n<p>Click on the purple chest in the starting area. It will give you one random weapon per floor, at the moment there are two available total so it's a 50/50 which one you get first.\r\n</p>\n<p>Killing enemies gives you a little bit of health. You'll need it!\r\n</p>\n<p>Upgrading attack speed is broken, but fun!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n\n<p>Click to move, click on an enemy to target them. If you are within attacking range, click to attack! You have a certain amount of mana in the bottom right of the screen. Attacking enemies will use up mana, getting attacked by an enemy\u00a0will\u00a0siphon mana from the enemy. Whenever you use up all your mana you level up, and get to choose from 3 random perks. The perks reroll from a pool of 4 whenever you reach a new floor. To advance floors, find the large elevator that will take you to the next floor. Each new floor more enemies will spawn. Good luck! If you die you reset back to floor one.<br/></p>\n\n<p>A fun list of some known issues:</p>\n<p>If an enemy is too close to a wall in very specific circumstances, it might not take damage. Lure it out into the open to kill it.</p>\n<p>The upgrade descriptions don't work properly</p>\n<p>Animations are loaded with pure organic game jam jank!</p>\n<p>Will these be fixed? Who knows :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/340/340c2ccaa68e8e774a32ff48c5402ae2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fonics"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
