{"id": 794413, "slug": "rover-delivery", "name": "Rover Delivery", "name_original": "Rover Delivery", "description": "<p>A quick, snacky arcade game about delivering packages on a frozen alien planet! Drive into cargo crates to collect them, then deposit them at your base for points. Avoid the alien wildlife (or ram into them if you're driving fast enough) and try to beat your high scores! Return more crates at a time to score more points, and return 3 or more crates multiple times without taking damage to rack up a huge flawless streak.<br/></p>\n<p>Features two game modes: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Time Trial -- play for as long as possible; returned cargo adds time to the clock; death reduces time on the clock.</li><li>High Score -- play until you die once with no time limit; score as many points as possible.</li></ul>\n<p>Rover Delivery requires the use of a keyboard. A single playthrough takes only a couple minutes, but I encourage you to try at least a few rounds.<br/></p>\n<p>I make games as a hobby in my spare time, so I won't be offended if you pay $0 for this game! Consider the option a tip-jar if you want to support the arts. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/477b4e595a34c1bb1e83d5d21d877e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Symbiotic Labs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
