By the way you play as Eloqi if it isn't clear.\u00a0They all said that a PowerPoint game would be awful and... yeah they were right. But it's not as bad as you thought so go play it. And I did try to add sounds so could you give me at least one pity point for that please? Thanks!\u00a0Oh and by the way, I got permission from everyone to use them as characters other than Leshem - which is why his part is so small. He didn't actually say 'no' though so Leshem, do tell me if you're not okay with this and I'll take you out. : )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T05:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65b7bcd7091b5742c08738884a30245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Eloqi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
