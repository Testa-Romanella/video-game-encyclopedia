Well, it's at least as early as I'm willing to go with these rereleases. What began as a second grader's poorly drawn fanfiction comic from 2006 became a Gamemaker game six years later. This simple, yet very poorly executed idea became the foundation of all the future games to come.\u00a0If you're looking for something actually worth your time playing, play Senioritis.</p>\n<p>I think the plot of this game involves Alex (me, I guess) going on a quest to save Cosmo the Seedrian after being kidnapped by Shadow the Hedgehog and turned into a meterex, a member of an alien race led by the evil Dark Oak. Will this brave self-insert OC be able to stop this menace?</p>\n<p>Of course not, because this game is borderline unplayable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80fdd280cfb070edb5b2e5e787f5cb26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["algamedev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
