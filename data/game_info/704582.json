Each team can choose to engage one another or look for a white and red POD\u00a0that spawns in a random place on the map. The first team to deplete the pod's hp (set at 300 by default) gains control of the <strong>NECRON</strong> inside (who will spawn will only as much hp as the total damage the\u00a0freeing team dealt to the pod). The necron acts as a 4th player on the team with enhanced vertical and horizontal movement! The two teams (the <strong>MUTANT TEAM\u00a0</strong>and the <strong>EXFIL TEAM</strong>) now have two separate objectives: The mutant team must eliminate the exfil team to win the game. The exfil team must first defeat the mutant whereupon an exfil location will appear at the site's exit. The exfil team must successfully make it to that location with at least one team member alive to win the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet the Developers!</strong></p>\n<p>The game will require one more quarter (10 week cycle at UCI) to complete, and we envision a much more polished combat system, cutscenes, re-envisioned POI on the map, fully realized hero abilities for all characters and better animations to complement all of that!</p>\n<p>The game development is lead by Alex Puh (aka Lex Machina) in association with VGDC at\u00a0UCI.</p>\r\nMEET THE TEAM!ROLE(S):Alex Puh3D Art, Programming, UI, Animations*<br/><br/>Tyler (TK) KaplanProgramming<br/><br/>Grant ReedProgramming<br/><br/>Duncan FuProgramming<br/><br/>Estey BolingUI Art<br/><br/>Gian-Paolo von RudenMusic**<br/><br/>\n<p><em>*\u00a0\u00a0Mutant animations only, additional character animations attrib. to Adobe\u00a0Mixamo.</em></p>\n<p><em>** Ingame music only.
