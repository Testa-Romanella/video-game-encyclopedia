I\u00a0could have expanded a bit more on the gameplay variety, as is it gets stale after a couple of games.<br/>Though, i really like the art style on this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrestling is Real</strong></p>\n<p>It's a 3D fighting game that in actuality has very little to do with wrestling. It had my longest development cycle to date, around 10 months, to be precise. I'm very proud of it, and i'm making a new game right now based on a very similar premise, called SKULLfracture. <br/>Truth to be told, looking back at it, this game kind of sucks, but with SKULLfracture i hope to fix many, if not most of its flaws, because the potential to create something very entertaining\u00a0is certainly there.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadow of the Darkness</strong></p>\n<p>This is literally a joke game. One day i saw they gave away Game Guru for free on Steam and i wanted to give it a try. This is the result.<br/>There's no engine out there that i could recommend less for creating games, not even 3D-Rad.</p>\n<p>nuskadamo.wordpress.com/home/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T03:56:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e49690bf67dd6dd8beda0e074478091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuskadamo"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
