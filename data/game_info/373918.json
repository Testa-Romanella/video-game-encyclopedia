The object of the game is to get rid of all cards. At the end of the game, the last player with cards in their hand is the durak.<br/>The attacker opens the turn by playing one card face up on the table as an attacking card,<br/>the defender attempts to beat the attacking cards by playing defending cards from their hand.<br/>Non-trump attacking cards may be beaten by either a) a higher card of the same suit or b) a trump. Trump -attacking cards may only be beaten by higher trumps.<br/>If the attack succeeds, the defender loses his or her turn and the attack passes. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker.<br/><br/>- War -<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.<br/><br/>The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck\u2014this is a \"battle\"\u2014and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.<br/><br/>If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a \"war\". Both players place the next three cards of their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:03:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/3736591c5d87b1d1948a485dad1de39a_TrNRAvk.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Liutauras Stravinskas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
