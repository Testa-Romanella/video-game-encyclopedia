Upon downloading this game I was greeted by an ambient soundtrack and was intrigued. At first I thought I was stuck in a psychedelic loop but then I was greeted by a beautiful start menu. Once I had started the game I could hear a voice. \"Hey, I know that voice! That's Marc!\" The voice differentiation between characters is marvelous and fleshes out the otherwise 2D figures. Next up is the character movement sounds, glorious and humourous. Overall I have been driven to keep walking this painterly environment in hopes of finding my true being, because, well, I'm the fucking chosen one\"</p><p>\"'Write me a review, you have five seconds' - 'Five seconds have passed. Fuck.'\" </p><p>\"I think I'm gonna be sick\"</p><p>For steady updates on this and philosophical fish, try https://www.facebook.com/highrangingproductssuchashealthcare<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8f46443e52dc31c50395bf24ccd0aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loths"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
