In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement new gameplay mechanics into your projects, which are new rules or systems that make the game more interesting to play. On one hand, you will learn to program a powerup, which give the player a temporary advantage. On the other hand, you will learn to program increasingly difficult enemy waves, which make survival more challenging for the player. A good balance of powerups and increasing difficulty make for a much more interesting gameplay experience.  \r\n\r\n2) Game Instructions:\r\n\r\n<p>Survive continually increasing enemies for 2 minutes. You have 3 lives to get the highest score.</p>\r\nPick up Powerup X (multiply): Super Push for 10 seconds.<br/>\r\nPick up Powerup Flame: Charged Bomb.
