In order to get the best insight, we will approach the topic from both sides:<br/>Packing, and Checking.<br/><br/>So, pair up, and let's begin!</em></p>\n<p>Aerospace Security Training is an asymmetrical multiplayer VR game, where one player in VR (the Packer) tries to hide illegal items into suitcases, while the other player on PC (the Checker) tries to figure out from an X-ray scan whether something illegal is there, or not.<br/></p>\n<p>The Packer can stack a variety of common items into the bags in such a way that they\u00a0obscure illegal items from the X-ray view of the Checker. The Packer scores points for every illegal item that passes, or every time the Checker falsely accuses them of carrying something illegal. Meanwhile, the Checker can only win points for every illegal item they find.<br/>So, the Packer can also try to use the common items to imitate an illegal item, and cause the Checker to claim a false positive!</p>\n<p>Known issues to fix + things to add/change:<br/>(someday, when more time frees up from working on\u00a0Panoptic)</p>\n<ul><li>BUG: For some reason, sometimes the items will get stuck to your hands. This doesn't happen all the time, nor with all items, and seems to affect some people more than others.</li><li>The current shader used for the X-ray view makes it a bit too easy to differentiate similarly shaped items. It should be replaced with a more\u00a0opaque shader, showing variety in object depth and density, instead of their\u00a0normals.<br/>Also, the X-ray view should be made either orthographic, or with a narrower field of view, to further help obfuscate items.</li><li>A lot of planned items didn't make it into the game, and some art assets that did need an overhaul.</li><li>The game currently lacks any proper gameplay progression, as well as any gameplay / usability /\u00a0...\u00a0options.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac15b2d2bdb38a988466c34dc216e432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Panoptes", "JanTuts", "thomas_sempai"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
