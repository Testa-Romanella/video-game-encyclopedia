Your Boots will keep you protected from the heat but they are too heavy to jump off the ground with so you'll have to leave them behind. You're safe to jump off of walls any which way you'd like but you'll always be out of one pair of boots and into the next.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Keyboard</p><p>Arrow Keys - Move</p><p>Space - Jump</p><p>Esc - Pause</p><p>F1 - Settings </p><p>Gamepad (Xbox 360)</p><p>Analog Stick or D-Pad - Move</p><p>A Button - Jump</p><p>Start - Pause</p><p>Select - Settings</p><p>This game was made in GameMaker:Studio in 20 days. Below is a list of the GameMaker specific resources I used to make parts of the game.

It looks funny though so it's okay.</p><p>Why aren't there more mechanics?</p><p>I decided I wanted to specifically explore the core mechanic of the game, movement. The movement in the game is pretty fun as is. Expect new content added to the game to include brand new mechanics. Each new mechanic would be focused on as much as each element of moving is now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac38080ae5180222831f8bb514473d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoenn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
