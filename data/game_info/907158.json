Navigate your dreams, piece together your story, and explore the eternal nowhere of human fantasy. Impasse is a game that warmly invites you to follow into the surrealistic landscape of daydreaming and look for your own dreams that have faded and vanished.<br/><br/>Impasse is a completely free experience and can be completed in under 30 minutes. It allows for a certain degree of branching storytelling, with all branches supporting one another. The game also allows you to switch from light mode to dark mode and vice versa. You can also use art from the Presskit pack, as long as you properly credit us.<br/><br/><strong>TEAM<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rina</strong></p>\n<p><em>Twitter</em><strong> |\u00a0</strong><em>Carrd</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>Mastodon</em> <strong>|\u00a0</strong><em>\u0421ohost</em><strong>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Design, art, writing, production, and management\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Laerin\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Programming and UI&amp;UX\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dibbie\r\n</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Draft reading and editing\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Kystermeister\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Idea bouncer\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Beluga Ten\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cDreaming of Ambience\u201d - Menu Soundtrack\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to friends&amp;family</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T14:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9c19d647cfa387ee1daf4c753e6ae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rina"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
