Run from ICE nodes while rerouteing data streams.\u00a0<br/><br/>Made for the\u00a02012 7DFPS project. Would love feedback on anything, so I know what to do/not do in my next game.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong>\u00a0<br/>WASD and Mouse to move. E or Left Mouse to interact. R resets current level. M toggles motion blur. Escape exits.<br/><br/><strong>Hints</strong>\u00a0<br/>The goal of each level is to use the teleporter. On some levels the teleporter first needs to be powered, and on others it is already active, but protected by a shield you must deactivate.<br/><br/>For development news, feedback and updates go here:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Orihaus<br/>Get the soundtrack here:\u00a0http://soundcloud.com/lhasamencur/obsolete-ambient-soundtrack<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/><br/>Design, Modeling and code by: Orihaus<br/>Sound and Music by: Lhasa Mencur<br/>Logo and Helpscreen by: Pietro Riva</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5dc308aff03c9ace6f0dee61817c0fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orihaus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
