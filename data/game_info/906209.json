Keep going until you run out of seeds and money!<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful, however, as if you don't grow a plant for 2 days in a row it will die!<br/></p>\n\n<p>You have to use a WEATHER card each turn, which will affect all plants.</p>\n\n<p>The resource cards are optional, however- use them if you need them, but remember, they cost money and you may need to buy more if you run out! You can alternatively press \"FINISH DAY\" if you're happy with the status of your plants.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T08:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f602d22b2ecbe445fa6decb809eabee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RealTanHen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
