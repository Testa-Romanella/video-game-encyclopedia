The name of the game sums up what you do. However its not that simple. There are 7/15/26 malfuntioning lights in the room which constantly turn themselves back on. Your job is to keep\u00a0them off for as long as you can. If all the lights are on, you lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may choose to either use the keyboard or mouse for this game. This can be toggled on the main menu before hitting play.</p>\n<p>Mouse (Easy)\u00a0\u00a0- Click on the light to toggle that light<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard (Hard) - Press the matching key to toggle that light</p>\n\n<p>Just an FYI mostly... as my leaderboards are online only</p>\n<p>The game uses my own domain (carter.games) to host a database holding all of the game scores. There is a chance this breaks in the future as the database may not stay alive forever. The game does require an internet connection to function as your socres are not saved if the game can't reach the server. If playing offline there is a chance the game will need rebooting every now and then.</p>\n\n<p>I recorded my screen for the duration of the jam and will have a complitation video of the games development as well as a shorter video with me going over my thoughts and explaining what I'm doing on screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll post links here when they are up xD<br/></p><p>Currently aiming to have the video ready by Sunday 7PM BST</p>\n<em>Audio - Music</em>\n<p>\"Arcade Red\" by\u00a0Magnofield\u00a0https://www.epidemicsound.com/track/CSUg9AMz0z</p>\n<em>Audio - SFX</em>\n<p>\"Bike, Bell Ding, Single, 01-01\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) (Freesound.org)<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\"Sadness\" by\u00a0punisherdan (Freesound.org)</p>\n<p>\"Power Down\" by\u00a0noirenex\u00a0(Freesound.org)</p>\n<p>\"Large Breaker Switch\" by\u00a0ModulationStation\u00a0(Freesound.org)</p>\n<p>\"Button V03\" by\u00a0volkbutphan (Freesound.org)</p>\n\n<p>Final Note:</p>\n<p><strong>Sadly no webGL sadly, can't get it working fully in time...</strong> Mostly because I can't get the post web request to get thorugh CORS.
