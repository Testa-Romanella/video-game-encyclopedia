{"id": 859628, "slug": "avery-ten-2ndth-savior-of-cleveland", "name": "Avery Ten 2ndth: Savior of Cleveland", "name_original": "Avery Ten 2ndth: Savior of Cleveland", "description": "<p>Cleveland in the year 2009. A good samaritan who slingshots parents across the city. A time traveler looking for the man that killed his father. A rogue AI set on Cleve-domination. Classic Cleveland stuff. In the same way Death Stranding set off the genre of strand-like games, Avery Ten Secondth will most likely kick off the Cleveland-like game genre. \u00a0Cleve-like. Clevish. Finding the name will probably be the biggest struggle for the genre going forward.<br/></p>\n<p>So yeah, this one is a bit rough, not going to lie. It's one of those Ludum Dare games where you run out of time and put together the pieces at the end and just hope it kinda runs. It became clear after five minutes that the protagonist should be called Avery Ten Secondth (II), and everything else kinda came out of that. Not sure where Cleveland came from, it's just a funny name (Cleveland is a beautiful city on the way up, in fact it became so beautiful that I had to set the game 10 years in the past because today it would have been too unrealistic to have it a wasteland). So now that I have hopefully dodged the hexes and curses of the Clevelandian population (the Cleves as we call them), thank you for trying my LD game and thanks a lot for playing!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys Left Right - Movement</li><li>A - Jump/Confirm story screen</li><li>A/S/Q/W - Start game</li><li>Enter - Skip story if you have no heart</li></ul><p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Original release date: 10/02/2022</li><li>Source code is on\u00a0<strong>github</strong>:\u00a0https://github.com/CaptainDreamcast/AveryTenSecondth\r\n</li></ul>\n<p> <strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b463a8f7eb5c13fc2b9134c4a6b18d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
