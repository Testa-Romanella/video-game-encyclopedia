Take on ghost hunting contracts with your taped-together equipment as one of four playable P.I.N.E characters. Hone your skills for your designated class, utilize an array of equipment to decipher your clues, and use that to identify your contracted apparition.<br/><br/>Choosing from a variety of thrilling maps, you and your team will be required to investigate your phantom, untether them, and finally neutralize them from this plane - that is if you can manage.<h3>Investigate</h3><br/><strong>Using your taped-together gear, it is up to you as a member of P.I.N.E to find out which phantom is attached to the location. Using tools like the EMF detector, temperature gun, and phantom book, you will be able to identify which ghost type you are up against.</strong><h3>Untether the Phantom</h3><br/><br/><strong>As a P.I.N.E member, it is your job to take care of the phantoms. You will be required to hunt down and untether the phantom from this world. Once you know what kind of phantom you're up against, you will have to search for totems, runes, or statues to successfully loosen the phantom\u2019s grip from this world.</strong><h3>Neutralize the Phantom</h3><br/><br/><strong>What\u2019s this? Flesh? Yes, you\u2019ve done it P.I.N.E! You've removed the phantom's ties to the spirit world and made them corporeal. Now you must neutralize the phantom, but they will fight back with everything they have. By using a weapon of your choice, anywhere from an EMFG rifle to a holy water-filled water gun, you can banish the phantom and restore peace.</strong><h3>P.I.N.E Classes</h3><br/><br/><strong>In Phantom Hysteria, you will be able to choose and level up 4 different classes to help you in your fight against these deadly phantoms! Each class is unique to cater to all play styles including support and tank.</strong><h3>Arcana Cards</h3><br/><strong>Arcana Cards are purchasable perks that can be switched out before every game that range in rarity, from common to unique. They can help you with stamina, health, adjustments to weapons, and more! Using these tools will be beneficial, and at times integral, for your unceasing battle to rid this world of phantoms. </strong><h3>Phantom Types</h3><br/><br/><strong>As a member of the P.I.N.E ghost hunting crew, you must know what you're going up against. When investigating, your phantom will be one of these phantom types shown above.</strong><h3>The Phantoms</h3><br/><br/><strong>One of the leading antagonists, Morrigan Payne is a powerful witch unshackled by death. Originally Bronwyn Craddock, the once-kind faith healer was murdered by witch hunters alongside her people.</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>What became of Molly Adkins should have been avoidable. A young teen living in the early 1970s, Molly was supposed to go to a movie theater with her cousin, but on that fateful night, fell victim to drunk driving. Battered, broken, and drowned, Molly wanders the earth in a haze of fear and denial.</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Lucas Jones was a gangster of New Orleans, a made man of the Mahoney crime family.
