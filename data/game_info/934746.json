{"id": 934746, "slug": "season-troubles", "name": "Season Troubles", "name_original": "Season Troubles", "description": "<p><strong>Season Troubles</strong> is a platformer game where the player adventures through 4 different levels. Those levels are themed in seasons. The further the player progresses the more serious the levels get. Climate change starts to destroy the environment or creates difficult obstacles. The player must overcome all of them. The end goal is to finish a certain level to fulfill the character's quest. In the spring level the big rain cloud seems to chase the player, in summer the player has to save the ice cream from melting, in autumn the mushroom hunt turns out to be more difficult than expected, and in winter ice and snow offer plenty of slippery hazards. However, every season also offers opportunities. With those on their side, the player has to fight against all odds.</p>\n\n<p>The game presents climate change in a new way. The player experiences four little stories. Even though every story has a unique value, all the obstacles the player must face in each level have the same origin - climate change. The levels get progressively harder the further the user progresses. This exact concept makes <strong>Season Troubles</strong> so unique - it tells four self-contained stories, which overall, however, result in a fitting overall picture.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7bac97d8de4308ba603ae687d634b17b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Averimon", "lukas_krisper", "stefanie_ober", "dotjulia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
