The idea is that eventually, you'll be able to hop to different grids. Currently, you can only stay on one grid. You (and your enemies) will be able to affect the various grids via gravity warping (like the kind you see on some of the grids when you load) and other effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fcafdd78bf4bf30b5cf65aed91240ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["deathmtn"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
