Strategically throw cards away to make the game advance to the next age knowing other players may pick them back up. Compete for prestige tokens and try to impose your supremacy. But as soon as any player sets down a 7th card in their timeline, the game ends and a winner is sanctified.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach run is usually very short, lasting between 2 and 10 minutes, and always very different from the last. Each card is unique and may impact the game for all players. Let the prestige tokens guide your strategy for extra points, or do your own thing and make the best out of the cards you're dealt.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features 7 different difficulties to play and unlock with the 21 civilizations in the game, as well as a gauntlet mode where you pick one civilization and try to beat all the others. Will you make your civilization come out on top?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T04:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8807c16a68f5d144c8f12c33784234.jpg", "website": "https://punkcake.club/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
