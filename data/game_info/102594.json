Still counting this as Sixth Edition though, which is why it's just a minor update, but felt I needed to bring it up.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: August 22nd, 2016<br/> </strong>To celebrate my mother's birthday, I'm releasing the \"Sixth Edition\" today!<br/>There's now a volume control and, well, some other minor stuff too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: June 20th, 2016<br/> </strong>Eh, changed my mind about the \"Version 1.0\" thing, so...<br/>The \"Fifth Edition\" is out!  Adding a new icon, and fixing a typo along with an \"I can't believe I made this stupid mistake\" save bug in \"Room 10,\" where I accidentally labeled it as \"Room 11.\"  How embarrassing!<br/>(actually I quietly released this two days ago, don't tell anyone, everyone)<br/> </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>UPDATE: June 15th, 2016<br/>\n</strong>On June 20th, the game will be available on Steam.
