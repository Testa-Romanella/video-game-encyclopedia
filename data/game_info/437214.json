Those 'Selected' must undergo a series of trials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through these trials Bryn embarks on a journey of self-discovery, in a coming of age story. There's a reason she was selected, and they'll wish they never chose her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Complete the trials, earn your freedom, discover your past.\"</p>\n<p>Basically, slice a bunch of stuff up and have fun doing it. Move from room to room, and slice everything you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Data analytics have not been used in this build, but will be used in future builds. No data will be collected from your sessions, so any feedback you do have if you could leave in the comments would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few notes on issues we are aware of:</p>\n<ul><li>Absolutely 0 juice, being added for the next build\r\n</li><li>Certain bindings aren\u2019t controller compatible (using \u2018space\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 need to be on keyboard)</li><li>Animations on the sword slice are still being implemented\u00a0</li><li>The sword clips in and out of view, which means you may not see it at all, but you will see the action of her slicing</li><li>There is a point in the second room when an elevator can be a bit weird</li><li>Tutorial has not been added, it is currently just an overlay of the controls on the screen. This will be changed in future builds.</li></ul>\n<p>This is the most bare minimum version of the project we felt happy disclosing for play testing. This content will be radically changing in the coming builds, in part with feedback and requests.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a2242df54972f11e05dde424f94359a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattsutton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
