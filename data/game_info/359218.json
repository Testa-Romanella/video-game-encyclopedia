With support for up to four players, you can play single-player or host a game to allow others to join you.  The higher the number of team kills, the quicker the zombies spawn with your personal kill count opening up new weapons for yourself as well as allowing more charges of your team buff.  Work as a team or turn on friendly fire and take down your teammates to slow down the spawn of zombies.  Just down stand still or the zombies will get you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a3b87adad28f52adf1324e0dd82549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harsh Reality Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Harsh Reality Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
