{"id": 314350, "slug": "citizen", "name": "CITIZEN", "name_original": "CITIZEN", "description": "<p><em>CITIZEN </em>is an interactive installation that creates a fantastical city soundscape from recordings of instrumental sounds. The visitor chooses an action or destination through a simple graphical user interface and the soundscape changes around them. Some recordings aim to be as representative as possible of the sound they mimic; others are more interpretive of an aural experience, or seek to render audible a visual or tactile sensation.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I am a \u2018city person\u2019; I have always lived in densely populated areas, and that\u2019s where I feel most at home. When outside that environment, I need time to adjust to the soundscape of wind, animals, waves, or silence. But, discussions of urban sounds are predominantly negative; they are \u2018noise\u2019, to be fought, regulated, and controlled.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Anthropologist Mary Douglas defined dirt as \u2018matter out of place\u2019; recently, noise has come to be defined as \u2018sound out of place\u2019. The sounds that dominate the city are those of transportation, construction, and industry \u2014 the very things that enable a city to exist.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It is indisputable that, at certain levels, sound can cause physical and psychological ailments; but, as we strive for healthier cities, <em>CITIZEN</em> suggests a way of listening to the urban sounds beneath that threshold, finding fascination or even beauty in the textures and dynamism they create, individually or in combinations. Within this, <em>CITIZEN </em>provides hints of a more personal story about the mixture of familiar, unfamiliar, and alienating environments that a city provides.</p>\n<p>MacOS only \u2014 Windows version coming soon.\u00a0Headphone listening strongly recommended.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Recordings by Laura Cocks (flutes), Ryan Muncy (saxophones) and Joel Rust (strings).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1beb488f33b652ed9f0e96ba6ab2cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Joel Rust"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
