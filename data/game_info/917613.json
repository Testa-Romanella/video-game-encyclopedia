Can you do it?\r\n<p>In this simulation game you take the position of an air traffic controller in the control tower of Budapest Airport to make sure all flights get to their destination safely and on time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Key features:</em></strong></p>\r\nAIRPORT ALIVE\r\n<p>To play this game is like playing model railway with aircraft, while making sure all flights arrive to their destination safely. (Almost) everything is on the move.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHASSLE-FREE\r\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to bother pronuncing tongue twister air traffic control instructions for the speech recognition system, then this is your game. You\u2019re always just a click or two away from issuing an instruction.\r\n</p>\r\nIMMERSION\r\n<p>If you like aviation and airports, you will find yourself sitting down for a short half hour stint, and getting up one and a half or two hours later.\r\n</p>\r\nEASY TO PLAY\r\n<p>Features like fire-and-forget one-click instructions, instruction queuing, hotkeys, and path highlighting will make your seat as comfortable as possible.\r\n</p>\n\r\nSETTING IT UP\r\n<p>Customization is easy. Do you want the busiest time of the day or just chill? You can get both by choosing a scenario.\r\n</p>\r\nREALISTIC RADIO VOICES\r\n<p>You won\u2019t hear any painfully slow robotic voices answering to your instructions in this game. Listening to many hours of real-life ATC recordings during development makes sure the game sounds as realistic as possible.\r\n</p>\r\nNO VIOLENCE\r\n<p>In this game you don\u2019t get any points for killing people.\r\n</p>\r\nEVOLVING\r\n<p>Development will continue. The game will get more features and content added in the future.\r\n</p>\r\nNO HIDDEN PAYMENTS\r\n<p>That's right.</p>\r\nSTATS\r\n<p>The game records all your achievements, including the number of flights, passengers, cargo delivered inbound or out.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThe plot:\r\n\r\n<p>You will take the seat of several different air traffic controllers in one person. You control the approach, designing a steady and well-separated inbound and outgoing air traffic flow. You take tower control position as well, to clear landing and take-off. Also, you take the position of ground control to let aircraft taxi between runways and gates, as well as pushback. Sounds too much? Fear not. The game design will help a lot with features like fire-and-forget one-click instructions, instruction queuing, hotkeys, path highlighting, and many more.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is a simulation of Budapest Ferihegy Airport at its 2006 state, using the summer timetable of that year. That was the time when the architecture of the airport was still at an organic, elegant state, before temporary buildings were added to hide its beauty (and handle more passengers). Also that was the time when a lot of now-defunct regional airlines had their flights and bases there, displaying a very colorful apron. Expect several historic aircraft!</p>\n\r\nWhy free?\r\n\r\n<p>London Heathrow, Amsterdam Schipol, Chicago O\u2019Hare, Tokyo Haneda, Sydney Kingsford Smith, Beijing Capital, Dubai International, Johannesburg are all great airports, but not included in this game (yet).\r\n</p>\n<p>Development resources have been concentrated on quality, not quantity.\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently this is an early access version of the game. Further development will go on.\r\n</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\nMinimum:\r\n<p>Windows 7 SP1+, x64 CPU, GTX1650 GPU, mouse, keyboard.</p>\r\nRecommended:\r\n\r\n<p>Windows 10, x64 CPU, GTX1650 GPU, mouse,\u00a0keyboard, fullHD screen.\r\n</p>\r\nThe game has been tested on lower spec. systems as well. It may run on almost any DX10 compatible GPU, although frame rates may drop sometimes.\r\n\r\nA WORD ON EARLY ACCESS\r\n<p>Although the game already offers a fully enjoyable experience, it is still in early access. There are a lot more features to be added in future versions. A quick peek into the development pipeline: many-many more animations,\u00a0more aircraft types, more airlines, baggage loading, refueling, catering, lavatory service, external power, frame rate optimization, optional instrument approach phraseology, and many more...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/3362fbcddfe278915bf054065e62fab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ATC Sim & Magic"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
