Choose an upgrade to get back to flying.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was written and designed by Alex Hayden, who works in customer service. This is my very first game and honestly my first experience coding in any way. This game was put together while following the Lazy Devs Academy video channel tutorial.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Krystian Majewski for the extremely thorough and well-presented lessons. I've wanted to make a game for well over a decade and this tutorial series was exactly what I needed to get a completed game published.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you to my play testers: Nick, Phillip, and Wesley. Your feedback was invaluable.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!\r\n</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Feedback is definitely appreciated! I'd like to make more games and I'd like this game to be fun to play!\r\nThat being said, I'm aware of a few issues with this game:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Occasional waves get skipped entirely\r\n</li><li>[nil] displays when you are out of upgrades\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>I'd love to fix these, but I'm totally out of tokens. I'd be happy for any tips for guidance as well bugs you see that I don't have listed.\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/96784e4528078f335bd08f144d1f89a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mosthumble09"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
