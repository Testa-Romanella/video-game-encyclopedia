That's however the only thing I updated, the rest of the game was made within the Jams time limit.\r\nControls:\r\n<p><em>Movement:</em> <strong>W,A,S,D</strong> |\u00a0<em>Selection, Attacking:</em> <strong>Mouse</strong> |\u00a0<em>Switch\u00a0Weapon:</em> <strong>Space</strong></p>\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Try to survive until the last day. Mr. Forest will need to eat and drink very often, take water from the well east of the house, look for foods quickly and return home to eat. Make a fire with 1x Wood and 1x Water&lt;\u00a0<em>Note: You can only eat at the fire at\u00a0</em><em>home &gt;\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Demons will spawn. A few at first, but a horde at the later days. You can fight them off, one isn't an issue. But be careful not running into more of them.</p>\n<p>You can make upgrades with wood at the workbench, highering your carry capacities and even making a strong crossbow.</p>\n<p>Tip: If you made it far, try to fill up your stocks and sit the invasion out. It's hard doing anything else with hundreds of demons in front of the house!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867308943e56acf8cc9dd1d166ef2f07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GapaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
