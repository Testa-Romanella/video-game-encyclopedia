The game contains different cases that require the player\u00a0to take on the role of Mr. Private Investigator to explore the crime scene, interact with clues, and ultimately\u00a0solve the classic whodunit question.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>* This is a four-week prototype inspired by the 1- bit 'dither-punk' aesthetic of early pixel graphics. The game takes on the detective fiction subgenre and mashes together mystery and comedy to form our own take on comedy noir. There are currently two cases, with the second being recently added. We are aiming to expand this game in the future. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0We hope you enjoy this passion project\u00a0of ours! :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:25:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/37984025f894ec89ecf747a680f4aa52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["justin", "Cathy Z.", "LK13", "Darcy_Lu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
