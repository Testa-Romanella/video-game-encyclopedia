They have a few seconds to memorize the symbols of the pins before the lock is covered and the level begins. The other conversationalist states what order they want to pins to be pressed in, and the player must press them in that order, remembering where each one is. If they press an incorrect pin, the last correctly-pressed pin falls down again. They are racing against the clock, and its urgency leads to excitement and tension.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T18:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/009/009885c6a95a4c652eac5672f1aaf4bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tomasque", "joavelar", "jjhung"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
