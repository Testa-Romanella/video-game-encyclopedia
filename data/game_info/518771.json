{"id": 518771, "slug": "last-hope-battle-sync", "name": "Last Hope - Battle Sync", "name_original": "Last Hope - Battle Sync", "description": "Game breaking bug when 1 enemy fighter remains, if you want to see the finish, collect only some of the orange circles at a time or none. (As they damage enemy fighters)\r\n\n<p>Was created for the 2020 Mix &amp; Game Jam, within 48 hours. Sadly as the project's file size was too big, caused the deadline to be missed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was created solely by Hayden's Studio, with the help of (@TheOwenEx) to create some much needed\u00a0voice lines. 98% of the code was created during this period, the 3D models and audio were bought or previously owned. While this was a semi-expensive adventure, we are very happy with the result.</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment down below what you think.\u00a0</p>\r\nSales Pitch:\r\n<p>With over 300 hand placed notes, this will challenge even the most seasoned players. Battle your way through an intense alien fleet, narrowly dodging missiles\u00a0and enemy fire, on your way to end this hopeless war.</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n<p>A/D or Arrow Keys to move,</p>\n<p>Press J when orange circle comes down, to sync with music.</p>\r\nSide Note:\r\n<p>Due to time, there is no death or a proper tutorial scene. The audio is most likely very loud, so suggest turning volume to 40%.</p>\r\nWhat's after this?:\r\n<p>After a day or two, we will add the interactive main menu, death system(currently disabled, due testing needs), master the audio, add more scenery, linux version,\u00a0etc. Only want to spend 1-2 days tops adding these features. As we want to start on a cartoonist shaving mini-game.</p>\n<p>Eventually we will be joining another game jam, but this time with\u00a04-6 people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a51ed2dcd1e46c2508acc498bb3b115.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hayden's Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
