The wife misplaced her glasses, right? The dread of missing her beloved carol singing washed over her. She was hysterical! So I says: Enough! We 'ave near-enough the same prescription woman! Take my glasses 'ere. And, be on yah way! I was glad to see the back of 'er, But stuck for what to do, I can see bugger-all without my glasses! We are both big readers, me and the wifey. And at least she 'adn't taken the reading glasses an 'all. So. I ran a 'ot bath. And I read me 'arry potter a while. Hey now, Quit your whining. You asked me for the story, and I'm tellin' it!</p>\n<p>So. I wake up hours later, to the sound of amarillo from me phone, the wife on the line. Singin' their carols at me over the phone they were! Bahh 'umbug I said! She forgot 'er house keys - she slept on em, she said - so she went round her fellow carol singer Barbera`s 'ouse and they 'ad been watching the 'allmark channel til the AM. She wants me to pick 'er up. The lights were out and all, so I forgot all about - that I didn't 'ave me glasses - so I say \"Sure!\", and I 'ang it up sharpish.</p>\n<p>Now Im wonderin 'ow am I gunna drive if I don't 'ave me glasses. and the chill in the air. Like Jack Frost was just round the corner. And dont ask me why but the windows are all wide open! <br/>Then I see in the night a silhouette of my beloved wife, waving and yelling something about the phone call wasn't 'er and she didn't go round Barbera's and they 'adnt watched 'allmark and It was all a pack of lies!</p>\n<p>I got me nightgown on, as the chills were downright shockin'! But, when I look back down out the window, the wife wos nowhere to be seen! I swear there was something odd about that night, like a dream or one o' them 'allucinations that scrooge 'ad that night before christmas.</p>\n<p>And here I am, wondering, did you read this text up to now? Were you expecting something else like some simple instructions like WASD and mouse to look, click to pull doors, and E to switch lights, and F to take and use keys? Well I'm not letting you off so easy this time! If you cant sit down and read my short story for 2 minutes You don't DESERVE this game!</p>\n<p>Okay okay, I was only messing around! Having a little fun. And, anyway, I *DID* just give you the controls. *AND* basically all the objectives in this game.</p>\n<p>SO.</p>\n<p>Its up to you now.</p>\n<p><strong>Ludum Dare 43 Jam Entry</strong><br/></p>\n<p>shrapx: Art, Sound, Coding and the writing here.<em><br/>\u00a0 \"1st 3D Game! 1st Unity Game! 1st Team Collab!\"</em></p>\n<p>Chris: Ideas and Coding.<br/>\u00a0 \"We decided to sacrifice the visual aspect of games that is usually taken for granted and give the player impaired vision, to introduce new types of problems and art style opportunities.\"<br/></p>\n<p>Find shrapx: </p>\n<ul><li>twitter.com/shrapxx</li><li>twitch.tv/shrapx</li></ul>\n<p>Find Chris:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>twitter.com/basiclaser<br/></li><li>basiclaser.itch.io</li><li> system-art.io<br/></li><li>twitch.tv/stockdronefootage</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec4/ec4132d56161e66d36791e886abb98a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shrapx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
