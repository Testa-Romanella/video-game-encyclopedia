This little (or should I say big) sequel is a funny arcade game which consists of enhanced graphics, music and game play.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Playing the game<br/><br/></strong>\"Revenge of the Flying Balls\" requires a <strong>joystick in port 2.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are trapped inside a dimension full of balls.\u00a0The object of this game is to simply, erm, shoot to burst them. However those balls are more fearsome and want their revenge on your poor space ship. Not only will they bounce around, but they will also attempt to shoot at your precious ship.<br/><br/>There is a limited number of flying balls to fend away. If you reach your quota, you will be transported onto the next level. The further you progress through the game, the more tougher and fearsome the balls will get. Can you destroy all of those balls and escape from the vortex, or will you become space junk?</p>\n<p>Programming, graphics and music by\u00a0<strong>Ryxx<br/></strong>Sound effects code by\u00a0<strong>Achim Volkers<br/></strong>Tape loader source by\u00a0<strong>Martin Piper and Richard Bayliss</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>(C) 2020 The Power Shed<br/></strong>This is public domain software.
