It is a top down action game where you have to evade traps and projectiles to reach the end of the level. You can gain upgrades between levels if you picked up enough vials.</p>\n<p>Controls are <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrows</strong> to move and <strong>Shift</strong> or <strong>Space bar</strong> to dash. When you finish a level, you get the upgrade screen. The 3 buttons mean: <em>DsCh+</em> adds an extra charge of the dash, <em>DsCd-</em> reduces the time for the dash to recharge and <em>ShCd-</em> reduces the time the shield takes to recharge.</p>\n\n<p>The game was made in Godot engine, the only thing that was not made by us in those four days is the tv effect shader which comes from here:\u00a0https://godotshaders.com/shader/VHS-and-CRT-monitor-effect</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:58:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f55be34ed29e82ab293e1e0585e2c09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["doublewookiee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
