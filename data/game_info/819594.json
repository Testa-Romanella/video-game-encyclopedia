{"id": 819594, "slug": "get-lucky-itch", "name": "Get Lucky (itch)", "name_original": "Get Lucky (itch)", "description": "<p>At the start of the game, you'll choose to spend three points between three stats: Charm (heart symbol), Intelligence (glasses symbol), and Guilt (eye symbol). From there, you'll roll the dice every round to determine which of your stats will increase or decrease, denoted by the appropriate logo and a plus or minus on the dice. Lady Luck will try to persuade you to let her pay, but you will have two dialogue prompts to choose from to convince her otherwise. The goal is to read the choices closely and play to your strengths for that round, choosing the option that seems like it would relate to your highest stat. Buffed or debuffed stats will revert back to their original value at the end of a round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Charli Kerr: Art</li><li>Alex Quiroga: Art</li><li>Ashley Wielgos: Art</li><li>Myah Bastian: Art</li><li>Ben Schuster: Programming</li><li>Doug Guzman: Programming</li><li>Andrew Krenzel: Design</li><li>Quinn Donnelly: Design, UI</li><li>Shelby Hickok: UI/UX</li></ul>\n\n<p>3rd party assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Sounds<ul><li>Study and Relax by Kevin MacLeod:\u00a0https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/24134/</li><li>Page flipping by carlerichudon10:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/carlerichudon10/sounds/466375/</li><li>Dice Rolling on Table by Flem0527:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Flem0527/sounds/629982/</li><li>trumpetF3 by slothrop:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/slothrop/sounds/48224/</li><li>Tap Tuba Mouthpiece:\u00a0https://www.findsounds.com/ISAPI/search.dll?keywords=tuba</li><li>http://tale3habet.eb2a.com/sound.php?id=7086</li><li>http://tale3habet.eb2a.com/sound.php?id=7087</li><li>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/sliding-glass-cup-on-table-151</li></ul></li><li>Fonts<ul><li>Ardeco by Jovanny Lemonad:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/ardeco.font</li><li>Balham by TypeTheFont &amp; Dannci:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/balham.font</li><li>Rialto NF Font by Nick Curtis:\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/rialto-font.html</li><li>Marchesa by skomii:\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/marchesa-font.html</li></ul></li></ul><p>Known Bugs:</p><ul><li>If you skip the typing as the buttons are sliding in or out, the game may softlock on a dialog option.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b65b0c3340391b5507b37af8a7827aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ASH", "Aurii", "Kerrtesy", "bschuster", "qdonnelly", "akrenzel", "Seadragon99"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
