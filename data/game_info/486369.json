Here's a challenge to include something found in one of our history series in your game. That could be a character, a place, or an event. It can be the focus of the game, or just a quick easter egg. Have fun with it!</p>\n<p>- Extra Distance -</p>\n<p>Social distancing is important &amp; necessary, and can sometimes feel like playing a game on it's own (avoiding joggers on the sidewalk, trying to decide if a grocery aisle is too crowded, etc.) This challenge is to create a game where characters or players can't enter within a certain distance from each other.</p>\n<p>- Extra Translation\u00a0-</p>\n<p>Games are no stranger to fantasy languages but sometimes they can get bonkers. From Simlish to Thu'um to Animalese, to whatever you're designing. This challenge is to make a language of your own for your game. It can be written, spoken, or both! Consider how &amp; what it communicates to the player.</p>\n<p>- Extra Retro -</p>\n<p>An art challenge that is a throwback to the MS-DOS as well as a previous challenge! Just like last year,\u00a0\u00a0limit your game's palette to one of the old, 4-color palettes used by the Color Graphics Adapter for MS-DOS games. List of 4-color options at:\u00a0https://lospec.com/palette-list/tag/cga</p>\n<p>( You can switch between the palettes for different scenes of your game like some MS-DOS games did. )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/12129284801eaffca35ac5868feb84e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shiverflags"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
