The game itself is a point-and-click action RPG.</p>\n<p>As of August 19th, this game won \"Most Innovative\" at the Intel Buzz \r\nIndie Gamedev Showcase, and looks like we will be bringing it to other \r\nconventions later this year!</p>\n<p>Reminder we have a fundraiser for the project here, and I've been \r\nkeeping up with updates relative to the percentage to the goal achieved.\r\n If you like the game, help me complete it!</p>\n<p>https://www.gofundme.com/help-fund-deathsword-a-haunted-crpg </p>\n<p>BE PATIENT WHILE THE GAME IS LOADING AND WHILE PLAYING. In order to make the GUI look the way I wanted it to, I disabled transitions between pages in Twine. If you don't give new pages time enough to load while clicking you could wind up \"ghosting\" some commands. That's not gonna do anything particularly fun or haxor and could screw up game quests and sound cues for you. Play it like you would an actual Apple ][ /Commodore 64/etc game and give things time to load properly before moving forward.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55cc7bdd52b2b9b04aecb11e49491972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
