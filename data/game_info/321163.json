This puzzle stealth game allows the player to be in up to 4 places at any single time, and interact with various copies of themselves, but as soon as they're observed, they collapse into the location that was observed.</p>\n<p>This game was my final year project for university. After much research, I determined that this concept hadn't been previously implemented in the way that I envisioned it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is more of a tech demo, showcasing the mechanic concept. I have intentions of taking this idea further.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information on Superposition, please visit\u00a0my website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T06:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a677196eac6c093d9d0af531a9c6220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fox Chaotica"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
