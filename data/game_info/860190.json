They will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the instruments and the individual subsystems of the spacecraft:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Electrical Power Subsystem\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Attitude Control Subsystem\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Communication Subsystem\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Command and Data Handling (C &amp; DH) System\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Propulsion System &amp; Propellant\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Based on the difficulty and performance of the players, a guide will be offered to assist with the operation, allowing everyone to enjoy and learn from the experience. The control is divided into three sections: the mission, which specifies the game duties; the Console, which controls the spacecraft; and Webbopedia, which educates the player. As a reward, the player will be able to make the same types of observations as the JWST.</p>\n<p>This can encourage children to explore STEM subjects and adults to learn about investments in the space business and exploration.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The current status is:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The app is a minimum viable product designed to demonstrate the concept's potential\r\n</li><li>The first version has many simplifications and does not represent the universe nor the spacecraft and its control precisely.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Planned improvements:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Implement Mission Control more representative that better represents the JWST mission (support from NASA or reference to a publicly available MCS specification would help us).\r\n</li><li>Create a more representative universe.\r\n</li><li>Add station keeping in L2.\r\n</li><li>Automatically load images published by NASA to the game environment.\r\n</li><li>Create a series of guided missions from the launch until the latest published observation.\r\n</li><li>Implement a guide to help the players through the missions according to their skills.\r\n</li><li>Release the game for common platforms (Win, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) and virtual reality.\r\n</li><li>Add more educational resources to the Webbopedia inside the game.\r\n</li><li>Consider adding on-board control procedures implementation to teach algorithms and coding.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T13:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0ff642169f19d052f0d5d40012e0d9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["voyager2"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
