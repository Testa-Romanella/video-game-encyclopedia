We also wanted to create a sense of exploratory wonder, while still keeping the game simple to understand.</p>\n<p>When you begin, you\u2019ll be face-to-face with a sign that welcomes you, but states that under no circumstance should you touch anything. We\u2019ll see how well that goes\u2026 Once you find a way in, you\u2019ll find a wide array of pottery, statues, and other pieces of artwork to admire\u2026 from a distance of course. There may be some other patrons wandering around, so make sure to respect their space and keep your distance. There\u2019s lots to discover.</p>\n<p>Sheridan's Design Week Winter 2023 Team 1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T12:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f62128ce97c0846d879d079cad2643b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joel_b_dev", "TCog", "rizzutan", "Reklaz", "justin_itch", "Tmax007"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
