After clicking 'Play' and launching it in full screen you may need to zoom out slightly depending on your monitor size!\u00a0</p><p>I'd recommend zooming out ('<strong>ctrl\u00a0</strong>+ <strong>-'\u00a0</strong>on Chrome)\u00a0until you know you can see all of it and then zooming back so it fits :). Anyway, I hope you enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\nGame information\r\nAbout\r\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours for\u00a0<em>Lundum Dare 46</em>. The theme was '<em>Keep it Alive</em>'.</p>\n<p><strong>Link to The Plant Shop on Ludum Dare</strong></p>\r\nAim\u00a0\r\n<p>The aim of The Plant Shop is to keep as many plants alive as possible before the countdown reaches 0.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left mouse button - everything... That's it.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Once you hit 'Start',\u00a0 each flower will start demanding different things.\u00a0Once this happens, click the corresponding item at the bottom of the screen and select the plant requiring that item to satisfy it temporarily.</p>\n<p>If you leave flowers too long without tending to them, they'll start to wilt and then die. If all plants die before the countdown reaches 0, you lose. And you go to jail for being a plant murderer.</p>\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes\r\nDevelopment breakdown\r\nDevelopment<br/>Conor GalvinUI/UXConor GalvinPixel artConor Galvin / Ethan Allport\r\nTools used\r\n<ul><li>Unity (2019.3.10f1) (development)</li><li>Visual Studio Community (programming)</li><li>Audacity (trimming and editing sound clips)</li><li>Aseprite (asset creation)</li><li>Adobe Photoshop (asset creation)</li><li>Figma (high-fidelity UI/marketing content)</li><li>Pen + paper (designs/scrawling ideas)</li><li>Trello (task management/planning)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Either play in the browser using the link at the top of the page or download the Windows executable below and then run 'The Plant Shop.exe'.
