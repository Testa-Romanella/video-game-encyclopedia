As his journey about to end, a sudden event changes the course of not only the young prince's destiny, but also the fate of the Kingdom forever.</p>\n<p>This game is a grid-based tactical game heavily inspired by the Final Fantasy Tactics series. I\u00a0hope this can be a worthy love letter to both the fans of the genre and the OG FFT.</p>\n<p>Lets sidetrack a little bit. I\u00a0have had the idea for the world of SCT for a few years now, and I have try different ideas and game genres, but ultimately, the tactics genre fits its tone the best. More detail will be explained in the companion devlogs, which should be available as soon as I\u00a0can upload those.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you guys will be able to enjoy the game as I am enjoying making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a87bc246b8398ab9df8cfb84b327bef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeySataniel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
