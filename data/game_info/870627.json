You see the game is simply very buggy, and that's not a glitch, it's a feature '(just kidding (or am I?)).</p>\r\nThe game\r\n<p>You can move around in a 2D plane and you can also see you point of view.</p>\n<p>The catch is that not all walls are solid, some are glitched and you can walk through them.</p>\n<p>Your task is to walk around and go through the glitched walls.</p>\n<p>You start off with only one glitched wall, but as you progress you will find more and more glitched walls.</p>\n<p>Have fun and good luck!</p>\r\nMotivation\r\n<p>I wanted to make a game that was a bit different from the other games in the jam. I wanted to make a game that was a bit more unique.</p>\n<p>This is my first time ever making a game (like ever). I wanted to make something that was a bit more challenging and was more focused on the game logic aspect rather than the playability.</p>\n<p>The game is a 2D raycaster experiment that I wanted to do for a long time. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PC</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WASD/Arrow keys to move around</li>\n<li>Q/E to pan the camera</li>\n<li>Z/X to look up/down</li>\n<li>Enter to confirm</li>\n<li>Esc to pause/go back</li>\n<li>Click and hold mouse to look around</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gamepad/PSP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>D-pad to move around</li>\n<li>Analog stick to move the camera</li>\n<li>L/R to pan the camera</li>\n<li>Circle/Triangle to look up/down</li>\n<li>Cross to confirm</li>\n<li>Start to pause/go back</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\r\nShowcase\r\n\r\n\r\n  Click to expand!\r\nMenu\r\nGlitch\r\nGame\r\nPause\r\nLevel Finish", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6bab4683d5044daa63deb25622bcf9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["KorigamiK"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
