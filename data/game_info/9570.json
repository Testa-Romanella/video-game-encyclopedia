Unlike in more traditional RTS, units obey the laws of physics, making design choices especially important.<br/><br/>The story takes place sometime in the future when sentient machines are seemingly all that is left of intelligent life. In a search for an elusive piece of software, authored by their mysterious and powerful creator, the machines have banded into warring factions. They predict that the code will not only provide the answer for the meaning of their existence, but also give the ultimate power to the first one to execute it.<br/><br/>Features<br/><ul><li>Design your own units from scratch.<br/></li><li>A variety of land, water and air propulsion methods: wheels, treads, jet engines, fans.<br/></li><li>Bend, twist, taper, scale available parts (plates, frames, tubes etc.) to further diversify your unit aesthetics and functionality.<br/></li><li>Apply decals to units.<br/></li><li>Multiple weapons with distinct weaknesses and strengths.<br/></li><li>Physics: Unit design affects its performance on the battlefield, as it obeys the laws of physics (e.g. massive units are slower and require more energy; a high center of gravity makes the unit unstable).<br/></li><li>Assembly Factory: Control and optimize the unit assembly process itself (e.g. the way the unit is built determines its construction time).<br/></li><li>Single Player Campaign.<br/></li><li>Online Multiplayer: Matchmaking, Private Games, LAN.<br/></li><li>Steam Workshop support.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa72644b0af400911782dae711d4e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 549, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quite Different Mechanics"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Quite Different Mechanics"], "esrb_rating": null}
