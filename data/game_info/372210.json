Slimey is a pixelated arcade top-down shooter game where you face randomised waves of enemies (currently only 2 types) to gather coins. You will then go to the store to buy ammo, potions, and cosmetics\u00a0that will give you buffs\u00a0(currently only 1, the Top Hat, which increases movement speed). You will buy upgrades to your gun to make your job of killing the enemies easier. At the end, you will get a score, and can start again to try to beat that score.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is in an early release. It will be actively updated and the final version will cost money.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:35:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/248/248aef25ce829cb6aff90dfdc67b5438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamzDEV"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
