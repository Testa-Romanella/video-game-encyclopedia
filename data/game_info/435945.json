{"id": 435945, "slug": "balance-me", "name": "Balance ME", "name_original": "Balance ME", "description": "<p>Balance ME is a simple physics game where the goal is keep \"It\" or \"Its\" from incinerating themselves by strategically (okay mindlessly) dropping boxes to keep them balanced on a seesaw. The longer you keep them alive, the higher your score increases.</p>\n<p>How To Play<br/>- Left Click to drop boxes<br/>- When the meter on the left fills up a new character will spawn.<br/>- Keep at least one character alive<br/>- The more characters you have a live at a time, the faster your score will increase.</p>\n<p>You can play the webgl version here\u00a0\u00a0https://shatley123.itch.io/balance-me-web-version</p>\n<p>This is my first finished Ludum Dare (I think?) Since Ludum Dare 32. I know I had attempted a few of them since then but nothing came out of it. I was starting to think that I just couldn't do it anymore.\u00a0 That's why i'm proud to have finished something I'm happy with.</p>\n<p>Balance Me was create with Unity, Gimp, Audacity, and Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>Fun factoid, almost everything in this game except the lava and text is a 3d mesh. I'm not an artist, and i'll be damned if I have to open a photo editor more than is necessary when I have all the 3d mesh primitives I need in unity :P</p>\n<p>The high score seems to be broken in the build of the game, but I am to tired to fix it :(</p>\n\n<p>Source -\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hy5Nw_Q7rQU03ALPig27RxAXfmKOHDbS/view?usp=shari...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/904b5d5cdea7e3b3b51c8b9d1d33ac3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shatley123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
