It takes place on the forest moon of Endor, and you play as a spacial ops stormtrooper now on a special assignment to be trained to be a Spy Trooper, the Empire's finest intelligence gathering division. Gameplay itself is you completing this training to become a Spy Trooper. This was a long time project that I have been working on, and I couldn't have done it without my team. Big thanks to my animator Max Iamo, and my voice actors Corwin Bauer and Ralph Anderson. A lot of hard work went into this project and I hope you enjoy it. And as always, may the Force be with you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Star Wars and all of its affiliated properties remains the intellectual property of Lucasfilm Ltd. under Disney.
