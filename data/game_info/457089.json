Either by yourself or with an online friend, alternate between customer service and overcooked-style food management while trying to serve as many couples as possible- but be careful, nobody likes slow service, even during rush hour.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is separated into three minute levels where one player takes the roll as bartender or waitstaff, or for single player, by switching roles.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>As a server, your job is to make sure your customers get their tables, food, and tables bused without holding up the whole operation. Greet customers with\u00a0<strong>E</strong>, lead them to a table, take their orders and drop them off for the Bartender to fill. Excellent service is rewarded with tips, so working fast to keep customers hearts filled is key - wait too long, and the couple will give up and leave without paying.</p>\n<p>As a bartender, your job is to fill the orders as they come in. Each of your operations take a certain amount of time and you only have so much space, so focusing on order cards and pre-preparing ingredients is the key for customer satisfaction.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls (Play the tutorial!!)\r\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Pick up or drop objects with\u00a0<strong>E</strong></p>\n<p>Interact with customers with <strong>E</strong>, from moving them to tables to taking or giving orders</p>\n<p>Certain stations, such as the cutting board and sink, are also operated with\u00a0<strong>F</strong></p>\n<p>Held objects can be thrown with\u00a0<strong>F</strong>, allowing you to serve customers from afar.</p>\n<p>For singleplayer, use <strong>Tab </strong>to switch between the waitstaff and the bartender.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Created in 14 days for Touhou Pride Jam 2</p>\n<p>Jose Garcia - Concept, Design, Networking, Basically\u00a0Everything</p>\n<p>David \"Texel\" Jones - Design, Code, Networking, Modeling</p>\n<p>Egophiliac (Egophiliac.tumblr.com) - Character Modeling / Texturing / 2D Art<br/>Raz - Additional\u00a0Modeling</p>\n<p>Music licensed via AudioNetwork -\u00a0Sneaks and\u00a0Ladders by Mike Westergaard\u00a0and\u00a0Miles Bould</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acfbc4b68636a80e3f7dc09b0e97bfcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Nitori", "LadyEbony"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
