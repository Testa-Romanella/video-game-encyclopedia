Yeah, you do, shooters are tight, right? Well, this is the tightest shooter, and it's only available on Windows Phone. WINDOWS PHONE!!! That means your friends with those other so-called \"smart phones\" will be super jealous because they can't play it. That's how BroSpace rolls, man.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>\"OK, let's do the rundown. Your space party has been busted by the fuzz, and you gotta fight for your right and all that. There are 10 crazy enemy types, 5 big bosses, and 4 insane weapon upgrades. That's gotta be like over 21 things to get excited about right there! The controls take some getting used to, but that's part of the fun. Tap-and-drag, baby. Use small movements like a frightened possum.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>\"This is white-knuckle, intense space shooting action. I don't even know what else to tell you. It baffles me that you haven't bought this app yet. Simply baffles. There's an homage to Space Invaders at one point, didn't I mention that?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Oh, and who wrote that music? You know it's Kevin MacLeod because his beats are the illest!\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>BroSpace\u00a0was the second app\u00a0released under my super secret\u00a0Misspelled Gmaes label, which existed to\u00a0provide an outlet for releasing quick and silly games and apps.\u00a0 BroSpace launched in January of 2013 for the now defunct\u00a0Windows Phone, and has been ported to itch.io so that it may live again.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bb4bc03571e740ac1c5c24ca98ceab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["modernloner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
