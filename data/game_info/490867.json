I read everything, and I value all your input!<br/><br/>Developer Notes:<br/><br/>There are few important things to note about the SUPERHERO-X formula: <br/><br/>- FREE FLOW COMBO SYSTEM - Mix and Match attacks like [PUNCH] [KICK] [POWER]<br/><br/>- POWER ATTACKS require METER<br/><br/>- There are NO GRABS [Feel free to BLOCK]<br/><br/>- 3-POINT EVASIVE COUNTERING SYSTEM<br/>  a] To COUNTER HIGH attacks - Press DOWN while lightly Stunned<br/>  b] To COUNTER MID attacks   - Press BACK   while lightly Stunned<br/>  c] To COUNTER LOW attacks  - Press UP       while lightly Stunned<br/><br/>- GUARD BREAKS: You can BREAK your opponents GUARD with Guard Break ATTACKS:<br/>  a] KARATE - GB Attacks: RUN KICK / PUNCH&gt;PUNCH&gt;LT<br/>  b] NINJA    - GB Attacks: FORWARD PUNCH&gt;KICK / PUNCH&gt;PUNCH&gt;LT<br/>  c] etc...<br/><br/>- RECOVERY OPTIONS: (Important)<br/>  a] If you get shot in face with a large explosion, you will spin out and hit the ground and get back up. You can however GET UP FASTER by pressing DOWN as soon as you hit the ground.<br/>  b] If you get hit by a powerful MID attack or after a juggle, you might fly backwards in the air and than fall on the ground. It takes awhile to get up as you SLIDE on the ground. You can get up faster by pressing THE DODGE BUTTON, infact for this particular STUN as soon as get KNOCKED BACK you can PRESS THE DODGE BUTTON and you will RECOVER in mid-air by doing a BACK-FLIP!<br/>  c] After falling to the ground you can recover in a few ways:<br/>     1) Press KICK to get up with a RECOVERY KICK<br/>     2) Press DODGE to get up with a GET-UP-KICK<br/>     3) Press LEFT TRIGGER to get up with a BACK ROLL<br/>     4) Press RIGHT TRIGGER to get up with a FORWARD ROLL<br/>  d] Some AIR STUNS allow you to recover with both options; PRESS DODGE to do a RECOVER FLIP and Press DOWN to do a RECOVER ROLL<br/>  e] Not only are these RECOVERY OPTIONS great to allow to get up faster, but some of them prevent you from taking EXTRA DAMAGE<br/><br/>- POWER-UPS: Power-Ups are what make SUPERHERO-X so special. When going to CREATION MODE you will have the option to CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTERS, by choosing their outfits and looks. But you will also be able to assign a POWER-UPs here for your characters, this will have an effect on the way your character PLAYS.<br/>   a] There are 10 POWER-UPS to COLLECT<br/>   b] Each POWER-UP has a TOTAL of 4 ATTACKS / Forward + Power / Back + Power / Down + Power / Power + NO Direction /<br/>   c] A lot of the Power-Ups are UNBLOCK-ABLE ATTACKS / But like most things in SUPERHERO-X you can COUNTER OUT OF THEM WHILE LIGHTLY STUNNED (This is important to remember)<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>PERSONAL NOTES: <br/><br/>- Please consider adding me to your friends list after you get the game and SENDING ME and INVITE to PLAY using REMOTE PLAY!
