{"id": 387921, "slug": "save-the-village-jnolen", "name": "Save the Village (JNolen)", "name_original": "Save the Village (JNolen)", "description": "<p>This game was my first time using fungus within unity, and due to my lack of experience with Fungus, and my still being in the early phases of using unity, it was ultimately rather difficult for me. In turn, I set a lower bar for myself than that of my other projects. I gave the player an option in the beginning, and a simple way to interact with the game, despite it being rather minimal. The story is meant to have a very brief feeling, like that of a side quest in a larger game. In turn, the scale of the lore provided is much smaller, as the player has to only - as the title implies - save the village. After finding a few free backgrounds to use (links listed below) choosing characters was rather easy, as simply fitting them within the theme was all I really needed to do.\u00a0I settled on fantasy just because fantasy is my favorite type of fiction, so the only difficult portion was the music. This is the first project where I've gone and searched for sounds to utilize, so with so many options before me it was hard to chose. Especially when it came to the music. I decided upon the song loop as it was simple, and honestly just felt right when paired with the game. I think the\u00a0higher energy rhythm fits well into the fantasy vibe I chose to use.</p>\n<p>Credits for all the assets (as I made none, I simply put them together)<br/>https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-hill</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/mountain-dusk-parallax-background</p>\n<p>https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack</p>\n<p>https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero</p>\n<p><strong>https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest</strong></p>\n<p>https://stensven.itch.io/flame-demons-64-x64</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ludist/sounds/204460/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Raclure/sounds/458867/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Sirkoto51/sounds/360608/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/SimonBay/sounds/439889/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89cb9d4413dc55634febad1d76d6cae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JNolen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
