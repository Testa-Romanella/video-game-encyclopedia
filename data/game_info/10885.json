Each Pigment you rescue will restore a layer of color, and rescuing all 5 in a level will restore all color to that level.  The <strong>Normal Mode</strong> of the level will have checkpoints along the way, while the <strong>Hard Mode</strong> modifier will remove all checkpoints and add additional danger.  <br/><br/>The 4 challenge levels in each world of DYE are filled with 100 \"dust\".  You free a Pigment every 20 dust collected.  There are no checkpoints in the challenge levels, and the Hard Mode version of these levels adds a restrictive time limit.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb21616ca525c32bd30eb6f062cd0b74.jpg", "website": "http://www.dyegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 29, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bat Country Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bat Country Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
