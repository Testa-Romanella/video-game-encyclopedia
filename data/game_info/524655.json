This was made for Mini Jam 68, which has a <strong>theme of \"sleep\"</strong> and a<strong> restriction of \"no text.\" <br/></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I decided to follow a strict interpretation - the game includes no spoken narration either. Part of the idea is figuring out just what you're supposed to do, so... best of luck! There's a minimal tutorial included, but it's best if you just dive in. <br/></p><p>If you are lost: Hfr gur neebj xrlf gb zbir, Hc gb whzc.
