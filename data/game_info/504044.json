We are two 13-year-old kids who decide to participate in the Ludem\u00a0Dare game jam. this is our first fully finished game. I (Ale) did the all the programming, UI, and post processing. Chris did level design, wrote the story and also did the text to speech. Since we could not think of any game mechanics that fit the theme and that we where able to make in two days we decided to incorporate the theme into the story. We had a lot of fun making this game and we hope you guys have a lot of fun playing it.\u00a0</p><p>go follow @not_chris.art<br/></p><p>PS. Stay tuned for our second release on itch.io where we plan to put in a timer, more levels, an actual settings menu, mac and linux support, and a more detailed story with visuals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/760688b888829c407dd262734b3933d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dogman888"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
