It is the first time I have used the OpenXR toolkit. And a lot of first-time things actually, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out.</p>\n<p>It is a Tetris game where you need to place the blocks on the beat. The better your timing, the more they will glow. A hard drop is performed with a fast downward motion of the right hand.<br/></p>\n<p>The game <strong>was only tested with a Valve Index</strong>. It should run with other OpenXR-compatible headsets as long as the controllers have A and B buttons and triggers. They will always show up as Index controllers in-game, though. Let me know in the comments if you have tested on other platforms, whether it works or not. If it doesn't work... sorry but it's not a project that I intend to maintain.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you'll have fun!</p><p>Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the Tetris Company.
