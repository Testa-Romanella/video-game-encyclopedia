It's a small platformer + shooter game filled with exploration and action. In this game, you crashed into a small planet filled with beautiful plants, but also space rangers. Your goal is to explore and find crystals scattered around the map, without getting killed obviously.</p>\n<p>I hope you can enjoy this little game, and give feedback for the future!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c31b1191632073657bd5606162ab73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vahe2003"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
