However, the abbey has been gripped by a curse! Can you lift it? Explore the island, solve riddles and puzzles to return the island to its uncursed state.</p>\n<p>This was a Level design submission for the LDJam-2 organised by Steve Lee. I really had to cram to get this submitted on time, so my main lesson is that I overscoped this project, a lot. That's why also a lot of the mechanics feel half-baked and maybe a bit frustrating. I wanted to use this jam as an oppurtunity to improve my UE5 skills. But I bit off way more than I could chew.\u00a0So I will adjust that for the next jam for sure!\u00a0I plan to refine this prototype and make it into a portfolio piece. All feedback is welcome! Have fun :) And fun fact for those who didn't recognise it already, this project is heavily inspired by the island of Mont Saint Michel.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>LMB - pick up/drop object</p>\n<p>RMB - throw object</p>\n<p>E - If holding object, put in inventory</p>\n<p>I - open / close inventory</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Space - Zoom in</p>\n<p>P - Pause Menu</p>\n\n<p>This is\u00a0 a jam prototype, sorry for the wacky mechanics and weird bugs. Here are some work arounds if you encounter common bugs:</p>\n<p>- if you cannot pick up objects anymore, drop another object from your inventory and try again</p>\n<p>- be careful with carrying items around the map, as they can get stuck in the geometry</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8de4de2e7ed634154d687736a60f13f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boarch"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
