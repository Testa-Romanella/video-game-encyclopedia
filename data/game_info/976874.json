This story unfolds ten years after the events of the previous installment. Unlike the portrayal of rural feudalistic customs from an urbanite's perspective in the previous work, this installment takes a different approach. It follows a youth, native to Tangxia Village, providing a perspective rooted in indigenous culture to depict the hidden feudalistic darkness and customs within Chinese villages more profoundly. Additionally, this installment emphasizes the theme of \"family\", and the humorous and comedic daily life elements from the previous work are preserved authentically, ensuring that you will not find this realistic and poignant subject matter dull. The protagonists and related characters from the previous work will also play crucial roles in this installment, interacting with the new main character, offering you a fresh perspective on the beautiful love story among the youths in the summer countryside.<h3>Story</h3>Little is known about Tangxia Village, a secluded small mountain village. The scenery here is picturesque, with a perpetual summer-like atmosphere throughout the seasons. For most people, it is like a utopia, but beneath this beauty, this village is rife with feudalistic customs incongruent with its idyllic surroundings. Human trafficking, gender bias, and archaic rituals such as ghost marriage persist in the village, remnants of the old society's customs.<br/>The protagonist of the story, Ma Xiaodong, is the son of the Ma family, local landlords in this village. Living with his father, Ma Qingchen, his two sisters, Ma Minyi and Ma Wenhui, and his childhood friend, Zhu Qianyin, the five of them share a household. As the eldest son, Ma Xiaodong cherishes every day spent with his family, valuing them above all else.  Though his father occasionally treats him harshly, he remains committed to the principle of filial piety. <br/>Despite the seemingly peaceful surface, the inevitable conflict between personal growth and traditional beliefs creates tensions. Like a butterfly breaking free from its cocoon, changes in thoughts and contradictions with traditional values become apparent one summer. In this particular summer, long-hidden family secrets gradually surface. Faced with the impending darkness, the choices between change and tradition, how will the young boys and girls respond? Will the gears of their destiny begin to turn, propelling them towards new horizons?
