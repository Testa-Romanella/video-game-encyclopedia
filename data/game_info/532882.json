With its colourful architecture and nice vistas to see, Sanjee enjoys taking in the sights of Mizue every day!<br/>An environment I created for a university project. It has a dialogue system for the tasks and some story, but its true strength is in the creative and stunning visuals (and where all the marks were)!<br/>The fps movement system is not mine (\"fps drifter\", free on the Unity Store). It is a little clunky when going up ramps and also running into walls!\u00a0<br/><br/></p><p>If you want to see more, visit my Artstation:<br/>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/w6q0w9</p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>Space - Jump<br/>LMB - Skip Dialogue\n<p>Additional Controls:<br/>Scroll Wheel - Zoom in and Out<br/>F1 - Screenshot (Shots located in \".../Mizue/Mizue_Data/Screenshots\")<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:34:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8fb7a2da1cbd55614fb4cf9bbc91eac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KonraDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
