You have just discovered an ancient temple where you have found an artifact of great value. Taking the artifact, you trigger the temple, and it begins to collapse along with the ground behind you. You run for your life and try to keep the artifact safe - how far will you get before you come to your inevitable death?</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p>Jungle Run is an endless, procedurally-generated, platform runner where you play as an explorer who is running away with an artifact that he has found.
