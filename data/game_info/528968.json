Believing his name would once again be held up for ridicule, Sir Clive concocted a despicable plan\u00a0 of revenge on all those using his computers for mindless gaming.<br/></p>\n<p>Step forward the successor to Clive Sinclair's failed C5 project - The Sinclair C6 Washing Machine! Capable of\u00a0 'washing away' the personalities of Spectrum sprites on websites across the globe placing them all firmly under the evil inventor's control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only one sprite was safe. A\u00a0 sprite that never quite made it back in the day, who stood little chance in a world filled with grinning eggs, rich guys getting wasted in their own private mansions and a funny little blue blob called Horace. Step forward\u00a0 Jetboot Joe!</p>\n<p>Now it's all up to Jetboot Joe to restore the Spectrum Sprites of the world in this\u00a0 retro shooter featuring 10 multi-directional scrolling levels filled with memories of over 120 classic Spectrum games. Relive the sights and sounds of those 80s classics and collect hundreds of souvenirs on the way in Project ZX II</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/4159f7fe99ee53c1d5486246fc5dea96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Langford Productions"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
