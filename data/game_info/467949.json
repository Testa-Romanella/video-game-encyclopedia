You encounter enemies who have lost control due to the music playing, and act differently depending on the music. You can play music on your piano to convert them to your side and attack other enemies. </p>\n<p>At the end of each dungeon you have to make a choice. These will be used to generate a custom surprise for you. So play till the end.</p>\n<p>Can you get to the end?</p>\r\n\r\n Game Jam Connection \r\n<p>So far there are only 5 levels, but I think they show off the idea.</p>\n<p>The game takes the theme \"out of control\", by looking at music. Music makes people lose control, and just let go. In the game the enemies are controlled by the music. Your only weapon is a piano which you can use to play music you've heard before, and cause the enemies to once again \"Lose control\" and attack each other.</p>\n<p>Each song has a different effect on the enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n For the curious onese \r\n<p> Throughout the game you are faced with a choice at the end of each level. The choice you make is recorded and used to generate a unique song for the player to listen too when the game completes</p>\n<p> The method of generating the song is simple. If using C major for example, the first note recorded is C. After this each choice dictates whether to increase the note, decrease it, or keep it the same. The notes generated will form the base fora 4 part writing composition.</p>\n<p> The appropriate chord is chosen for the note in the base to be played by the upper three voices. By defualt the closed chord with the doubled root in the supprano is used, but random changes are used to spice things up.</p>\n<p> Because the game ended up being a bit shorter than I'd hoped I also made it so every note the player chose was used to form a bar based on two different patterns.</p>\n<p> I wasn't able to get the generation to fully work, sometimes it produces disonant chords, I think I may have mislabled the sound files for the keys, but given the time, I didn't feel like going through the 80 plus of those.</p>\r\n\r\n Credits \r\nSymphony no. 5 in Cm, Op. 67 - I.
