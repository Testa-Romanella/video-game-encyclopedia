There's a total of 49 ways of winning a match, so understanding of the three planes as a whole is a must for beating your opponent. By now it's best enjoyed as a two-player game, since the the A.I. hasn't been implemented yet. Also, there's an option for viewing the playfield as the classic 3x3 version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c3a68b72f8356d4bd788134a8f314f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rapharodrigo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
