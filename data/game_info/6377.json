Challenging but fun. Reminds me of flappy birds\" - Satisfied x10<br/><br/>The original Zombie Gunship\u00ae is one of the most popular <br/>games on the App Store.  We received many awards from many people, and it even hit #1 grossing in the charts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this April 1st... Limbic lost all the original code and artwork for Zombie Gunship\u00ae due to an incident with a soft-serve ice cream machine, mail-order nightvision goggles and Mike the intern. Most of the engineering team is still outside crying while rocking back and forth.<br/><br/>So, Zombie Gunship Arcade is basically the best we could do to get things back up and running. We probably should have known that floppy-disk backups weren\u2019t the way to go...<br/><br/>So get out your tokens and get ready for some classic style arcade fun.  And here\u2019s your warning; this game is hard, just like all the old ones used to be.<br/><br/>Featuring:<br/><br/>- One gun! Remember how the original game had three? Well... this one doesn\u2019t!<br/><br/>- Side view!  What more do you need, fly up, fly down, shoot zombies, don\u2019t crash.<br/><br/>- Cool Buildings and stuff! Yeah!<br/><br/>- Game Center, Leaderboards and Challenges!  More than three letters allowed.<br/><br/>- iOS Game Controller support for full arcade immersion", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T13:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dab47d85f02215d0d517be1fc50d1317.jpg", "website": "http://www.limbic.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Limbic", "Limbic Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Limbic Software"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
