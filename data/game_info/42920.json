Check out the remastered HD version of Resident Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1998 a special forces team is sent to investigate some bizarre murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Upon arriving they are attacked by a pack of blood-thirsty dogs and are forced to take cover in a nearby mansion. But the scent of death hangs heavy in the air. Supplies are scarce as they struggle to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More detailed graphics that retain the horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The environments come alive with detail thanks to resolution upgrades and non-static 3D models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post-processing effects like Bloom filters, which were not easy to do at the time of the original release, have been added to make the HD graphics even more realistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-Resolution Environments - We&#39;ve increased the resolution of the background environments by recreating them with a mix of high-res static images, plus animated 3D models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Widescreen Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Widescreen (16:9) is supported, so players can experience a greater sense of immersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In widescreen mode, the screen will scroll. The parts of the screen that get cut off on the top and bottom will scroll into view automatically depending on the character&#39;s position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can switch the display mode during gameplay in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound &amp;amp; New Controls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-Quality Sound - The audio has been remastered to increase the sampling rate, and of course 5.1ch output is also now supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Controls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can play using the original control scheme or an alternate control scheme that lets you just push the analog stick to move in the direction you want to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can switch the control scheme during gameplay in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2015-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T23:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3cf/3cf4e76bfd5283331c83958c830a761c.jpg", "website": "http://www.capcom.co.jp/biohd/en/index.html", "rating": 4.31, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 214, "owned": 1063, "beaten": 467, "toplay": 144, "dropped": 114, "playing": 39}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 44, "ratings_count": 520, "suggestions_count": 546, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 524, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
