She is first placed at the St. Lawerence Market with her mother who is the key to her development. Her mother introduces her to the CN Tower briefly and it is this landmark that she adventures to throughout the story on a journey to find her mother and her lost self. In order to complete the game, one must bring together a mother and daughter again. Try not to get lost though, are you going to go back in time to Old Toronto...... or stay in the present of Toronto. Maybe even go further to the future.... safe travels!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a6353ae5363006945545c46a0bf9114c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marisatortola"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
