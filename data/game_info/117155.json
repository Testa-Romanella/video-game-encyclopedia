Everything is expanding, and you have to escape as fast as you can. Be quick, space is running out of space.</p>\n<p>This game is a little 3D space simulator, where fleeing is the only option.\u00a0\r\nDefault controls are mapped on WASD, shift and space, and mouse for camera/direction. <br/><br/>It's our entry for LDJam 42. We hadn't made any new game creation attempt for a long time, and the Ludum Dare was a good occasion to try again, as well as discovering Godot Engine.\r\nWe hope to add more levels to this in the future. <br/><br/>Tools used : <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Godot Engine</li><li>Blender</li><li>Krita</li><li>Gimp</li><li>Audacity</li><li>NormalMap Generator</li><li>SpaceScape</li><li>Sfmaker</li></ul>\n<p>Musical instrument used :<br/>- Nanoloop mono on gameboy<br/>- Korg Volca Keys<br/>- Korg Volca FM</p>\n<p>We hope you'll enjoy running out of space!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9ec5d82b402be0dbc6d732291875cd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chocolat-Endive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
