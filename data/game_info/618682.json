The older scientist can then pick up the components and place them into the machine.</p>\n<p>As you get closer together, more portals will open and enemies will spawn faster, letting you complete the game quicker but making it a lot harder.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move</li><li>Space: switch character.</li><li>Younger scientist: mouse to aim, LMB to shoot.</li><li>Older scientist: click and drag nearby cogs to move them.</li><li>ESC: Pause.</li><li>R: restart</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Fonts used:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers</li><li>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Concert+One</li></ul>\n<p>SFXR used for sound effects.<br/></p>\n<p>Artwork created in GIMP.</p>\n<p>Available online and for Windows.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Jodie for moral support and sustenance through the Jam.

That said, there are things which I meant to add in but never got around to. The following will hopefully be present in a post-jam version.</p>\n<ul><li>Time limit which can be extended using pickups.</li><li>Music and more sound effects.</li><li>Finishing off the artwork for bullets and portals, overall improved art.</li><li>High score based on time player was able to beat the level.</li><li>Different powerups/weapons.</li><li>Visualise the link between the characters.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:37:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d3de1de80ac30d13d94388262d13d47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["erodoeht"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
