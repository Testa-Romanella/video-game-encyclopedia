Find all of the weapons that are scattered around the spaceship, find a key card that will be placed somewhere on the ship. Avoid the Toaster (cylinder) and fridge (cuboid) enemies. Your oxygen will keep decreasing, killing these enemies can give you more oxygen, you will also need to repair oxygen generators, but the enemies can shoot these generators and fail the repair, causing you to start the repair from the start. There is an upgrade table in the armoury, you can use that to upgrade your weapons, but you will need parts for that first, these drop from the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb370cac53d2204fb8b7a5aad783ae47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrownsmithGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
