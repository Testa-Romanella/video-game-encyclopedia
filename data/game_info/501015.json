You wake up and choose a suit to wear. Always the same one. And commute. You drink a coffee in your favorite cafe while looking at the waitress. And commute. You go to the office, dreaming about the new job position in a different city. And commute. In the bar you drink some beers. Alone. And commute. You are back home, again. Another day begins. Will you be able to break the loop?</em></p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Interaction: Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Exit: ESC</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Maribel Mart\u00ednez @KetorGD: Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Kiko Mart\u00ednez @puntocomgd: Art and Environment Design</p>\n<p>Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Mart\u00edn: Screen Writer</p>\n<p>Carlos Mic\u00f3: Programmer, Quality Assurance</p>\n<p>Emilio Soto: Music Composer</p>\r\nWE RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THE GAME TO HAVE AN OPTIMAL EXPERIENCE<p>GAME PRESENTED IN THE LUDUM DARE 47.</p><p>THEME: STUCK IN A LOOP.</p><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/commute<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e1cb541fe01e676d60e6bdf9c89411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mc2games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
