Everything is placed on the blackboard. The frame and the ball are drawn with the chalk. To add to the more realistic approach, a duster is also placed at the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>Place your finger on the vertical legs of the frame and move it up and down by sliding your finger. As you move your frame up and down, the chalk ball moves according to the direction of the down slope. If you tap on the legs, then ball makes a jump. So, you need to coordinate the perfect timing for the jump and the slide. And remember, the clock, you got to beat that too.<br/><br/>+++Game Features+++<br/>\u201cOld-School Look in Graphics\u201d<br/>\u201cEye Pleasing Colour Combinations\u201d<br/>\u201cSimple Touch &amp; Tap Format\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/027e26019b7c056ca89318336444df32_NO6oHLI.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Serge Spijkstra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Serge Spijkstra"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
