At the same time, there were strange changes in the local environment around the fluctuation space, and from then on, the Earth fell into a tripartite struggle. After a period of time, humans have initially mastered some of the techniques of D&amp;D for manufacturing mechs and training pilots. At the same time, due to the small number of D&amp;D, their power development is relatively slow, and most of the EB stay in place, which to some extent limits the development of D&amp;D, causing the three sides to temporarily maintain a balanced state. In this situation, the emerging free explorers collaborate with human armies to seek new breakthroughs...<br/><br/>This is a placement game with fewer clicks and waiting for revenue<br/><br/>In the game, you will experience the feeling of becoming an seeker while also becoming a bit of a town administrator<br/>When becoming an seeker driving mechas, complete tasks, earn rewards, accumulate resources, and gradually improve oneself; You can also find partners, team up for battles, and enhance team capabilities; It can also meet the needs of towns and increase the upper limit of towns and teams at the same time<br/>When becoming a town administrator, watching seekers complete tasks allows the town to acquire the resources needed for development.
