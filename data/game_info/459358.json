I\u00a0know a lot of developers use Unity. Back in the days, I've used Flash until it got deprecated. Back then, I\u00a0thought Flash was great, but now\u00a0I'm hesitant to make games using an engine, because it always has some limitations that ends up bugging me and this always reflects in the end results.</p>\n<p>So I've been working on producing a game engine ever since. And it's been difficult. This is around my 4-5th attempt at creating an engine. I've made some in the past, that I\u00a0had to retire because they were too difficult to work with.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0thought this time I\u00a0got the right formula. So after evolving my engine to a satisfying level, I\u00a0tried to work with it.</p>\n<p>And history repeats itself... It's HORRIBLE to work with that engine.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0think everything was ok, until I\u00a0tried to introduce web worker to do game processing, then the performance became unreliable, and the code was difficult to debug.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this was my attempt. It's possible I'm going to... again... redo a new engine from scratch for my next game.</p>\n<p>So this game was originally an attempt to produce a game, with all art coming from me. At the end, because of time,\u00a0I\u00a0couldn't get a good picture of me for the main character, so I\u00a0used my Dobuki mascot instead. The rest of the decor (eyes, mouth, hand) are pictures of me.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0was also hoping to create a story based game, but like I\u00a0said, this engine is too difficult to work with. So at the end, I\u00a0made whatever I\u00a0was capable to do quickly with that engine.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy. This is a \"So bad it's good\"\u00a0jam anyway, so I\u00a0guess it doesn't matter how bad the game is. I\u00a0hope it's not too frustrating for you, and that the frame rate keeps up. I\u00a0have no idea how it will perform on your computer. On mine, I\u00a0can reach 60fps if I\u00a0close everything else, so perhaps you can try to play the game like that.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56c/56c565a2e3abd625061f1564eca5bdda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Le Hamster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
