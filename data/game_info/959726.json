The entire area is filled with fine dust-like particles, the air is heavy, and it seems as if all sound has been swallowed up. The dark atmosphere is chilling. The deep gullies on the ground resemble endless whirlpools, from which there is no escape. In this desolate world, strange and mysterious creatures appear and disappear like ghosts in the darkness. Here, terror and chaos reign supreme, and nothing can predict what will happen next. And the most frightening thing is that there seems to be some incomprehensible force hidden here, which leaves people at a loss and deeply trapped in it. These mysteries and secrets often lead to even darker abysses!\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Chaos is Coming\" is a personal independent development of the Cthulhu Mythos-style card roguelike game. In the game, the player will enter the realm of chaos to explore, face various mysterious and crazy creatures and events, collect powerful relics to drive away monsters, and escape the domain before their mind is corrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring the exploration process, players can freely choose characters with special talents, match their own equipment plans, and use limited resources to choose their own growth direction, make careful decisions, and make rational use of resources to avoid death and continue to move forward.
