The later stages aren't very balanced and there is a loooott missing but its fun trying to not die to the absurd amount of enemies so maybe consider giving it a try :D<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD<br/>Shoot - LMB<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>(NOTE: below is\u00a0 just me ranting)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The current game is such a small fraction of what I had first envisioned this game could accomplish, but as with most people in game jams, I didn't have enough time. I definitely think I could have spent my time better, like for example I didn't need to spend so much time on the title screen lol. I was actually going to add way more to it like lab machinery and wires but I realized there were better things to work on. Something you'll notice if you play the game is that all of the enemies have the same shot pattern, this is of course not intended lol. Right before the time limit there was a bug I found with the projectile code that made patterns with multiple projectiles not work properly, and I wasn't able to fix in-time, so I had to cut my losses and give everything a single projectile. I was actually considering not submitting the game because of how unfinished it was, but I thought why not so I did it anyway. Something else I wanted to do was add bosses every other stage, and I actually already sprited all of the bosses in question but I wasn't able to get that done in-time either. Besides these things there's a lot more that I wanted to do (in hindsight i don't know how I thought I could get all of this done before the time limit)\u00a0but I've listed them here: Special stats for the character and investment points gained every level that you can put into those stats, (to increase stuff like damage, health, movement speed etc.), a variety of items that your character can equip in different slots, each granting skills that your character can use, ranging from combat to movement to buff skills, cards you would be dealt every level that you can pick to grant special bonuses (similar to deepwoken if you've heard of it), fluid animations for everything and the main character's sprite changing when you equip different items, crazy bullet-hells and actually fun boss fights, a co-op mode that allows you to play with other people, and probably more that I can't remember right now. All of the things I've listed here I have the capability of adding, I just lacked the time, so I'm thinking of continuing to work on this game and update it as I add everything I wanted to. I feel if I stay motivated to work on it, it could turn out to be a pretty fun game \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T11:45:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f78cc072662ea2b2dd162f7b0d0e08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shmitttty"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
