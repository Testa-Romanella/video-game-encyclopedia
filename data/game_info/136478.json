But be aware for monster which try to steal your vegetables! To kill them you must use some of your seeds.<br/></p>\n<p>It's best to read the ingame help first. You can toggle it with Q after the timer ends.</p>\n\n<p>The game is played with the arrow keys and 2 extra keys. One (Space) for shooting and planting. The other (F) is used for collecting, selling and to switch the weapon/seed. Selling your vegetabbles not only increases your highscore but gives you more seeds too. You need to kill monsters too but they can only die if you shoot the right vegetabbles at them. When a monster dies it will give you more seeds and it isn't a danger to your plants anymore.</p>\n\n<p>This little and fun game was made by three people. The art, except UI (Inkscape), is drawn by hand in krita. Sounds and music by bfxr and wolfram tones. Every piece came together in the Godot Engine. The font used in this game is free.</p>\n\n<p>Link to font:\u00a0http://www.dafont.com/de/komika-title.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/1761d0c86850ad821a8669921502352a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thenaka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
