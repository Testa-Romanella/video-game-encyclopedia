In this game, you need to use W &amp; S or UpArrow &amp; DownArrow in order to move your cursor then type in the correct variable that is causing the issue in order to display the error. This was made for a game jam with the theme of Failure is Progress, so you progress in the game by throwing errors :D. I hope you enjoy the puzzles! They're not that hard since I made the game in one day during the afternoon, so sorry about that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4eb5004e08a7528c1676eeca0156bc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArturPrograms"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
