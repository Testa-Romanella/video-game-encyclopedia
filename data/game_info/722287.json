Hopefully you like it :D</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Game contains bright changing colors, if you have an epilleptic condition or some family member does, we encourage you to not play this game.</p>\n<p>Update v1.01: Fixed a crash where exploding a barrel very close to 1 or more other\u00a0barrels (those \"!\" enemies) resulted in a infinite loop and ended in a crash.</p>\n<p>Update v1.02: Kinda attempted to fix a random crash with barrels once again. Patch may or may not fix the issue but anyways, at least tried.</p>\n<p>Update v1.03:\u00a0Fixed another nullreferenceexception due to a wrongly established layermask.</p><p>Update v1.04: Added some alternative keys for some actions as requested. Now all enemies explode after a while, making it harder to surround enemies and farm time.
