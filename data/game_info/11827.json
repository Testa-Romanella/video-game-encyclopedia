A unique real-time, cooldown-based combat system challenges players to form combos between their combatants, setting up brutal moves and countering the plans of their opponent. But be careful - every time a Reaper dies, they come back stronger, so moving closer to victory will also make your opposition even more formidable.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Tactical Fighting Game<br/>Epitaph's combat system is real-time, cooldown-based combat fought on a linear board. This creates a constant, measured pace for the action that keeps things active while still giving players enough time to make strategic decisions. Positioning, timing, and area control are all essential parts of landing devastating attacks and avoiding damage from your opponents.<br/></li><li>Battle Among Deaths<br/>Epitaph takes place in the afterlife, where the many faces of Death are facing off against one another in a battle for souls. There are thirteen different Reapers in epitaph's current roster, ranging from Hassarin, the Necromancer, who controls opponents and saps away their lives, to Ezzim the Executioner, who cleaves the souls from his victims with his mighty ax. Stylish abstract character designs and a unique trip-hop soundtrack add to Epitaph's ambiance and make it look and feel like to no other esport.<br/></li><li>Death Is A Strategy<br/>When a Reaper dies in Epitaph, that isn't the end - they'll come back even stronger, with added power. You'll need to kill your opponent's characters six times to win, but doing so makes their team more powerful with each death. Winning at Epitaph is also about knowing when to die, and how to gain the most advantage from your losses.\u200b</li></ul><br/><br/><ol> <li>Draft a Team of Three Reapers <br/>Control a team of three Reapers, the many faces of death.
