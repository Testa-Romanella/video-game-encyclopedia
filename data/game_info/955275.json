I wanted to make a game over spring break and decided I ought to revisit Knockoff Dinorun. The original was terrible in every sense of the world and the fact it exists is deeply upsetting, so to make up for it I created this!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's better in every way (in my opinion), the gameplay is smoother, the cacti are actually random, the pacing doesn't randomly go from 1 to 1000 when the score hits 600. Best of all you can play it in browser, something the original lacked (not sure why but it did!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall this was loads of fun to do and to learn, and most of the features added are visual and quality of life. Sadly I didn't have the drive nor mind to try and make it so there is a gradual increase in cacti speed and I hope you can forgive me, alongside that I didn't have the will to add in pterodactyls (first try!) and I hope you can forgive me for these actions curtesy of the many cacti in the game.</p>\n<p>Overall I hope you enjoy it, cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:02:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c78f7d4ae24c9221cb14f8f157f0d3c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ATACOMANS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
