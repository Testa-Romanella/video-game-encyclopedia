Rules are simple and intuitive enough for kids to play easily, yet there is more than enough strategic depth to satisfy the most demanding gamer. If you enjoy challenging games like Chess, Checkers, Go, or Shogi, discover Arimaa and see why it was chosen in the Discovery Channel's list of the Top 10 Mind-bending Strategy Games and also recommended by Scientific American MIND magazine.<br/><br/>\u201cThe rules are simple enough for kids to learn, and the game was creative and engaging.\u201d <br/>\u2014Frederik Joelving; Scientific American Mind magazine<br/><br/>With millions of opening setups to choose from, every game requires creative thinking right from the beginning and no need to memorize openings. It's a never ending puzzle, each game is different. In just the first 10 moves of Arimaa there's more possible games than there are atoms in our universe.<br/><br/>\u201cBecause the number of possible moves in an Arimaa position (roughly 20,000) is much higher than in chess (about 30 or so), even the fastest computers will not be able to search very far into the tree of possibilities.\u201d <br/>\u2014R. Wayne Schmittberger; GAMES magazine<br/><br/>Arimaa provides the whole family a chance to show the computer who's boss. Many games boast of the strength of their computer AI, but Arimaa requires a higher level of intelligence which humans possess and computers have yet to achieve. In fact Arimaa offers a $10,000 prize for anyone capable of writing an AI that can defeat the top human Arimaa players.
