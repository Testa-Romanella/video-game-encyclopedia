I come to you this time with my new fps game: Captive Centrifuge.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for GJL 2021 Fall under the theme of \"Leave Something Behind\". It works with the mechanic of using your arm as a projectile instead of weapons, then you have to go and get your arm back for your next attack.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Leaving your arm behind and running to the door once it is unlocked can prove more advantageous, I think that is how it fits with the theme.</p>\n\n<p>So please jump in, throw your arm to some bad guys' faces, and use your arm to push buttons (or just headbutt them!) to unlock doors!</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Another game made by Yigit Yildiz.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Left Mouse to throw arm.</p>\n<p>Space to jump, left control to crouch.</p>\n<p>R to restart, L to quit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb913961adb6e8bb462790110e19cc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yeeticides"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
