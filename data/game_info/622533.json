A delightfully wacky story about the process of creation and being human.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFollow our little hero as he tries to make sense of the strange and sometimes frightening world he's been thrown in.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey Features :<br/>\r\n- Story oriented<br/>\r\n- Light puzzle and platforming<br/>\r\n- About 10 to 20 minutes long<br/>\r\n- Hand-drawn and animated<br/>\r\n- The adventure continues in Sprite Sequence Chapter 2!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis project started in 2016 as a way to try and make games like a webcomic is done : by releasing a small bit of the story every week. This improvisation based process gave rise to a game I wouldn't have wrote otherwise and I'm quite excited to share this first Chapter with you, that compiles the 10 first entries of the project.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(Note that the weekly creation has halted after Chapter 2 but may resume in some not so near future)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T02:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e258d659e34fb3d5214931860cd1fcad.jpg", "website": "http://spritesequence.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Small is Beautiful Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Small is Beautiful Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
