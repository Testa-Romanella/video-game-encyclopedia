The original aim was to create an open-world, zombie survival so we shall see if that's what happens.</p>\n<p>Feel free to play it and I'd love some feedback on what was good/bad and if you had any problems.</p>\n<p>The controls are reasonably easy to pick up if you've played a few PC shooters before but I do recommend checking the 'Input' tab in the start-up window.</p>\n<p>Thank you and best of luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88e8cd7f6fa45f1642b3fbf212867fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lapatron"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
