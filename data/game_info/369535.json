{"id": 369535, "slug": "castlevania-elegy-of-the-curse", "name": "Castlevania - Elegy of the Curse", "name_original": "Castlevania - Elegy of the Curse", "description": "<p>In the year 1691, Dracula's castle has risen to the skies of Transylvania. Simon Belmont, wielder of the Vampire Killer, set on a journey through the halls of the dreaded castle, his objective to destroy it's master.\u00a0<br/><br/>He succeeds in this task, but, Dracula cursed the warrior with his last breath. This curse not only affects him, but the entire Transylvanian countryside. Now, Simon must find a way to remove the curse.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Notes\u00a0<br/>As expected of a Castlevanina fan-game, expect the classic action-adventure aspect. However, various RPG aspects will be included, as well as changes to certain game mechanics, to better adapt to the engine and keep the challenge fresh. Such as the ability to maneuver Simon in an attempt to dodge enemies. Note that the area of action is not a traditional 2D plane, but uses a \"bird's eye view\" that still keeps the feel of a side-scroller.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T04:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227c56a8e65d9c3288c2feebc8ebab9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richterwilker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
