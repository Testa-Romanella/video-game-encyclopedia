One day a small rebel faction known as \u2018Blood Red\u2019 came from out of the shadows, claiming that sentinels and sentinels alone should occupy the earth as they were the next evolutionary step. After years of war, the human race prevailed with the help of sentinels loyal to the human\u2019s side. </p>\n<p>However after months of debate, the United Nations set a mandate. That all sentinels were to be round up and locked away in a secure facility where their powers could not be used against another human again. Now any remaining sentinels live hidden deep in human life, trying to never use their powers so that they will not be caught and sent away. But now the government has found out about these hidden groups and are hunting them down.</p>\n<p>Hanna is a 17 year old girl who works alongside the leadership of her underground cell.
