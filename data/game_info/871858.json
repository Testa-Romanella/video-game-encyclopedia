The speed and aggression of the stickfigures is randomly generated</p>\n<p>Controls and Characters:</p>\n<p>Space shows your phone (phone shows time) but don't use it too much as it'll run out of battery (it's an apple phone)</p>\n<p>Seb: think of Seb as Bonnie (fast, but has no special mechanic, only goes left) he can be stopped by getting blinded with your phone (your phone needs to finish it's animation before working.</p>\n<p>Saint Bernard: has a chance of going left or right, acts like Seb.</p>\n<p>James: Can't be stopped by the phone, instead he can be slowed by clicking him in the cameras or pressing space in the cameras (pressing space drains a bit of phone battery so be cautious)</p>\n<p>The Teacher: think of the teacher like FunTime foxy in UCN (has a set date when your work is due in the top left, when it hits that time, you need to be at their camera (the one that's a bunch of jumbled numbers) and hand in your work). Clicking the text on the top right will turn it to simple mode</p>\n<p>David: think of David like old man consequences in UCN, David has a meter at the top (similar to Undertale's attack meter) if you press Enter while the slider is hovering on the green, you will murder him, if not he will be a nuisance for a while.</p>\n<p>Laptop (cameras): The text in the bottom right corner shows your laptop heat when it reaches 0 you won't be able to see the cameras until it reaches 20 (it cools down on its own)</p>\n<p>Keybinds:\u00a0 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 takes you to 1, 2a, 3a, 4a, and 5a. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 takes you to 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, and the teachers room (bleh).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T09:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5733fd18c66609c24ac633ed161905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["LeDogeK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
