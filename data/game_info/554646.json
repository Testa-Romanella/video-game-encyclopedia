The theme was \"Lost and Found\".</p>\n<p> Bernie has lost his mittens and his kittens and he needs you to find them again. Use your go kart to go around the track and collect the missing mittens and kittens, so you have extra time to stay warm. Watch out for chickens and dogs as they will only just get in your way. Finish the track before you succumb to the cold weather. Good Luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>#globalgamejam #ggj #ggj2021 #gamejam #indiedev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036a2f48a9463bcd7f69e250d175f2db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greg Squire"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
