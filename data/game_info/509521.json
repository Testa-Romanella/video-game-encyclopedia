Although it's not as easy as it seems, as touching anything can result with your death.</p>\n<p>There's a couple gameplay mechanics you should know:</p>\n<p>The Square: Follows player, and randomly drops an orb.</p>\n<p>The Circle: Bounces around the screen like a ping pong ball. Gets faster with time, and detonates orbs when it touches them.</p>\n<p>Making both enemies collide will increase gradually increase your multiplier and change The Circle's direction, thus allowing it to hit more orbs- so more points for you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7ecb78061319a10233ed889c3fed35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tEEvy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
