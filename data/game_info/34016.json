You collect different colored particles, steadily growing your trail - in size and in color. No goal, no aim, just floating and relaxing and enjoying the view.<br/><br/><strong>stardust</strong> is influenced by sci fi books like The Martian Chronicles by Bradbury or Foundation by Isaac Asimov. It is made to reflect the atmosphere of eternal loneliness - instilling a feeling of silent terror, beauty and awe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7afe7d63e73b6cdadc92d456aa9eec24_zjHLUYP.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Housemarque", "Bloodhouse", "PocketJoy", "Pidibidi Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bloodhouse", "Pidibidi Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
