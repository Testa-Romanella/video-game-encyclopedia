One day you fall asleep on the job and you get accidentally locked in the mine. You think this isn't that bad other than the fact of being hungry and thirsty. But it worst. At night in the mine, monsters come out. So, you must go through four levels and collect key cards that are around the four levels to escape the mine alive. So good luck!<br/><br/>Oh another thing, there is something hidden in a room that is empty. Good luck!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Caverns and I hope you look forward to my future games!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/><br/>Arrow Keys: To Move<br/><br/>X: To Start The Game</p>\n\n<p>Links To My Social Media:<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.create-games.com/profile.asp?id=36304</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/nicholas.walton.355?ref=bookmarks</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Nichola59358734</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/monadoboy64/</p><p>Originally Released on June 15, 2018.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a37822eba00cd2f94a428587d68cc57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonadoBoy64"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
