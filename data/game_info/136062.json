But the Space Slugs and Propeller Beasts find his Flowers and Stems a tasty treat! Space Plant's only protection is his Green Mushroom Shields! Can you help Space Plant collect the matching light particles and protect him from Space Monsters? </p><p>The Controls are pretty simple, considering the challenge. Left Arrow or A rotates him Counter-Clockwise, Right Arrow or D rotates him Clockwise. Use the flowers to collect matching light particles, use the green mushroom to block enemies (Stems don't count!). If all your flowers die, or a monster hits your Root Ball, you lose! <br/></p><p><strong>(PLEASE NOTE, TWITCH.TV Integration is OPTIONAL!)</strong></p><p>A big feature of this game is something I've wanted to build into a game for a while, Twitch.tv integration. Once you set up the game to connect to your twitch channel, viewers will be able to type commands into chat to spawn monsters or light particles.
