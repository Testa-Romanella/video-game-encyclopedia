I was really grateful for the feedback I received last week and felt like I should give something else a shot. The goal for this week was to not spend as much time on the game and spend more time learning the why's? There were some cons to this plan however. My game is very bare and has no images. I\u00a0only had time to learn the scripting with Unity tutorials \u00a0and found the font on 1001 free fonts. This project has been very helpful in learning new aspects of C# scripting that I didn't know before such as scriptable objects and going outside the MonoBehavior base class. I'm someone that likes to learn a lot, but doesn't always do it effectively and I feel like I really focused in on my scripting this time. I hope you like my game and I am sorry once again there isn't more of it, but I didn't have the time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My hope is to keep the architecture of this project to build a bigger 'choose you own adventure' text game that contains animation and sound design such as creaking doors and footsteps, and maybe some interactive music. I wrote the music again though and am very pleased with the outcome. Although I\u00a0am dying to use FMOD with one of my projects I\u00a0haven't had time lately and will get around to it soon. Thank you and I hope you enjoy the game and concept.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/6512b06a6bc4f0e81ca335716874ba25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skrumf"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
