Tim and I decided on a cellular automata style simulation for creating dust and lava. It was our first time trying this type of simulation and are quite happy with the result from one weeks worth of work.\u00a0 The game was built using Godot with all simulation code living in the inbuilt GDScript language.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We halved the pixel density for the browser version to make it run fast enough. However we've include the windows exe version with the normal dust resolution. Please try that version if possible.</p>\n<p>Tim and I both had a lot of fun putting this together, and we hope you enjoy playing!!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>All programming by Tim 'BronxTaco' Day and Dom Lawlor<br/><strong>Tims Gamedev Discord<br/></strong>Dom's Github</p>\n<p>Music and voices\u00a0by Tim Day<br/><strong>Bandcamp</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ASSETS</strong></p>\n<p>Most art assets from\u00a0<strong>craftpix</strong>Control button\u00a0graphics from\u00a0<strong>astralpixel</strong><br/>Sound effects are from\u00a0<strong>freesound</strong>CC-BY-4.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T08:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4a0d217c33376fa7922b79936dc60f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["bronxtaco", "dom-lawlor"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
