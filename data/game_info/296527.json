Will probably keep working on this as time goes on because I think the base mechanics actually came out pretty cool.</p>\n<p>Software used: Aesprite, GameMaker 8.1</p>\n<p>V1.0 is the version that was uploaded before the cutoff time of 11:00AM, but has bugs in almost every aspect of the enemy mechanics due to the enemy movement system not matching up with how I had previously coded the status effects system. These problems are fixed in V1.2, but V1.0 is still available for download for the sake of transparency. V1.2.1 fixes some other minor bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T03:55:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4dde587a718bff5329b8dc80d58cdb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nanite9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
