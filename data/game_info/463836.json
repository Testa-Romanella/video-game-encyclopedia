You can accelerate or slow the speed a little or\u00a0 move left and right. Use the \"SpaceBar\" to fly a little (Yes, i know, it's cool).You can only return home after charging the time energy to 419, no time to fix that before the end of the Jam.\u00a0 After that use \"alt\" + \"F4\" on your Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Les Fran\u00e7ais peuvent utiliser les touches \"z\" \"q\" \"s\" \"d\" pour bouger ,ralentir un peu, ou acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer ou les touche fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es a la place .\"Barre espace\" pour voler au dessus du sol un moment. \"alt\"+\"F4\" en m\u00eame temps pour quitter la machine temporelle quand vous avez fini.\r\n</p>\n<p>Why\u00a0the Time Travel Machine\u00a0can\u00a0only\u00a0travel\u00a0one\u00a0time?\r\n</p>\n<p>True Story. I didn't make my time machine in 2 weeks like the other mad scientists of the Full Moon Jam, but only in 3 days, because i was busy. I repaired and launched my Time Travel Machine just before midnight the 12 july 2020, just few seconds before the deadline. But unfortunatly you can only travel one time and come back . You can travel time\u00a0 by charging the time energy to 140. Unfortunatly i made a mistake and i thought i was lost in time but i came back and you can come back too.\u00a0 You can return to your time only with time energy at 419, and after that my time machine is broken.Sorry but you will need to quit the Broken Time Travel Machine by pusching the \"Alt\"\u00a0 +\" F4\" Keys at the same Time. </p>\n<p>Good Luck. I know that you will not like to beeing lost in space time 3 minutes on my broken machine but you will return Home and i will repair it.</p>\n<p>Graphic assets \"Polygon\" by \"Synthy Studio\".
