For every round, you are presented with a level, a number, and a time limit. Your job is to figure out, before you play the level, whether or not the smallest possible number of moves needed to complete it is represented by the number. If it is, you solve. If not, you skip the level and roll again.<br/></p>\n<p>As you play the timer will get faster and faster. There are also 3 different difficulties with additional level mechanics. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Note: The first few screens are just a tutorial so you understand how the game mechanics work<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys - Select where you want to move</li><li>Space - Make a movement</li><li>F11 - Full screen</li><li>Hold Esc on title\u00a0- Quit game</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Everyone who contributed:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Serponge, Lumpy</strong> - Lead Game Designers and Programming</li><li><strong>Novedeht, Alterran, Spu7nix</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Additional Programmers</li><li><strong>Thomartin</strong> - Lead Artist</li><li><strong>Mbed, Darwin, Mels</strong> - Lead Level Designers</li><li><strong>Vermillion, Dysbelief</strong>\u00a0- Additional Level Designers</li><li><strong>Novedeht</strong> - Lead Composer &amp; Sound Designer</li><li><strong>Dominus</strong> - Additional Composer</li><li><strong>Micc, DavJT</strong> - Additional Sound Designers</li><li><em>Main Character - Alterran</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:00:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/1522bed888ddd27742603bf2d7af56d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["serponge"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
