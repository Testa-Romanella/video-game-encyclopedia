It's a mystery story in which you can examine things and talk to people. Unfortunately the case remains unsolved due to time constraints but maybe you can imagine a solution with the few clues hidden in this first part. Maybe I'll continue it someday or maybe not, think of it as a pilot episode for a new\u00a0 tv show: who knows if it will be finished!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/778a7867c19fa0ac31f7c45a90b91e3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wandering Artist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
