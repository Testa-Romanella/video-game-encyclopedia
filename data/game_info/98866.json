Use your keyboard (WASD) or the controller's analogue stick to point into the direction you want your ship to go: The ship will then steer towards that direction.<br/></p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Getting rid of moored mines gives you more space to outmaneuver incoming mines: Try to get as many with your torpedoes as you can.</li><li>Before and between waves, there will be some dialogue which you can skip. New enemies will not spawn until they have finished talking, however. You can use this extra time to take care of moored mines!</li><li>You can also shoot mines that are still out of sight</li><li>Don't collect health pick-ups when you don't need them, yet: They may come in handy later on!</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game has been my spare time project for about a year now.
