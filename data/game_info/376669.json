There were other things to be implemented as the bonus bug you can cath and earn more point, or the the hazzard of the turtles diving into water. But because I have no more time for this project I need to leave behind these features.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this mini game project and if you like leave me feedback of your experience with it.</p>\n<p>;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/09403845211ec70044143a96af0e930a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ancaria Nova"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
