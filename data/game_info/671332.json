The theme of the BHE event was to get two characters with little to no relation between themselves and create a boss fight for them. I personally also created a stage and other things to accompany it.</p>\n<p>Together with this file, I bundled three other things. The game, a redistribution package of Visual C++ runtime programs, \r\nand a Credits file. \r\nIf your game crashes when loading, please try installing said runtime program.\r\n  </p>\n<p>How to run the game: \r\nFirst, you must get LuaSTG Ex Plus 0.82b, you can download it in this link: http://en.luastg.shoutwiki.com/wiki/LuaSTG_Downloads \r\nAfter you download it, please put the \"Ashes of Jeweled  Treasures.zip\" archive that is right beside this file that you're  reading inside of the folder \"mod\" inside the folder \"game\" of the  &gt;LuaSTG package&lt; you downloaded. Simply open \"LuaSTGPlus.exe\"  inside the \"game\" folder (before \"mod\"), select your settings and  username, then play the game. <br/></p>\n<p>Original page: https://www.bulletforge.org/u/ryann1908/p/dong-fang-yin-ta-de-ashes-of-jeweled-t...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ecb958d5e8ae9c5a5a36a2d377d3ac8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryann1908"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
