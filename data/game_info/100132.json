In order to survive, and not dehydrate, you must drink from the pond that is in the middle of the island, but there is a catch. The time in between rain falls grows every time it rains, and eventually, you will dehydrate faster than the rain will occur. Lucky for you, there is a magical table that is on the island that, when given two items, will either give you a special item, or a clock to speed up the time it takes for it to rain. How long can you survive on this island in the sky?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/928/928fa75a0ae142d871bd4459f6aa99ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Old School Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
