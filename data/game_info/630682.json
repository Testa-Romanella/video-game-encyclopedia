Every creep reaching the middle of the platform will spawn a heavy particle beam, making parts of the platform unusable. Once you lost 50% of the platform, the game is lost.<br/><br/>Use different types of towers with different ranges to build a maze. The longer the creeps need to reach the middle, the longer you can shoot at them. Survive the waves of creeps and progress through the levels - with each level your platform will grow bigger and will spawn more creeps, which get more powerful as well.<h3>Engaging Tower Defense</h3><br/>DeHexTD will keep you engaged during the waves. Keep expanding the maze, upgrade towers and find a good balance to survive as long as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/633/6336d78f7c046bd9c74647529cd581d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["reiti.net"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["reiti.net"], "esrb_rating": null}
