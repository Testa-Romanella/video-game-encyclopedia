{"id": 439939, "slug": "the-gunslinger-2-alpha", "name": "The Gunslinger 2 (ALPHA)", "name_original": "The Gunslinger 2 (ALPHA)", "description": "<p>This is an alpha for my next game The gunslinger 2. 10 levels with 1 boss and one secret boss. <br/></p>\n<p>The biggest difference is that the player doesn't have a gun but can use the cursor to move and control certain objects around in the level to their advantage. Right now the player only has access to five different objects to interact with (enemy bullets, certain walls, sword, pistol, and bear traps). They all have different mechanics right now. Only one main enemy type (other than boss and secret boss) and I massively improved enemy AI to make them smarter so they can use pathfinding so they can try to dodge objects the player is using and some other obstacles. I also experimented with some shaders to make the game look better and feel better while playing it. <br/></p>\n<p>I would really like feedback. I need to figure out what I need to fix if there is any bugs with this early alpha prototype. <br/></p>\n<p>Anyways I hope you enjoy<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e24/e249e0efcb768d97cef3953b7b79bf80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evilous"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
