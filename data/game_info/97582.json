The poor DRUDGEBOT machine finds that the power station it was commissioned to service has not seen any maintenance in... a long time. As F155L3 \"Fizzle\", make your way around the power plant, gather the energy cores, and reestablish power.</p>\n<p>The system is running in Backup Power Mode, so you will have to manually power the doors using local emergency switches. Use your Gravity Manipulation Tool to actuate the emergency switch pads and move supplies around the plant. </p>\n<p>You have limited battery reserves so make every moment count. Drain all of your energy and you will shut down permanently. There are charging terminals scattered around the facility, however, they are only running on limited Auxiliary power. It is doubtful that they can support more than once charge.</p>\n<p>Local scans indicate unknown biodiversity in the vicinity. Mind your steps, for there may be more than just rust and dust in this forsaken place....</p>\n<p>F155L3, restore power to the main reactor. Follow protocol.
