Beside general game design elements and design, I made pixel art assets for the game and made parts of the UI.\u00a0 The game is supposed to be an satire/serious game about selfie culture. Each year more and more people gets killed or injured because they tried to take a selfie in a dangerous situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a bit buggy, so it might decide that you have been hit by the train before you have actually been hit by the train, and therefore end the game prematurely. We also implemented a system where when a selfie is taken the game was supposed to calculate a score based on certain points in its viewport. However, This is not working in this version, </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/886161f927a3414464eff64677c8562a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZenGame"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
