Earn credits by doing an odd job or two, commissioned by your friendly neighborhood bartender for an undisclosed third party. Or perhaps you're a more of a do-it-yourself kind of captain? First acquire blueprints and then with a bit of raw ore mining and some creative haggling with the traders, assemble the parts into something that can get you rich! ... or at least cover your bar-tab. Almost all items found in the game can be combined with other items to create new ones, ranging from composite materials to entire weapon systems. Or you can keep it simple and sell the stuff to the highest bidder.PIMP YOUR RIDESwapping entire ships is nice and all, but what if you really liked the chassis of one and the engine of another? Why not combine the two? Yes, my dear captain, you're no longer confined to the bare metal shapes that form spaceships. Mix and match individual parts to form something special, something new, something that speaks to you. Incidentally, if it actually does start speaking to you, we advise seeking medical attention.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKEY FEATURES:<ul><li>The largest game universe in the Starpoint Gemini series spanning three different planetary systems\n<br/>\n</li><li>Adrenaline-pumping, action-packed space combat that allows distinct play-styles and on-the-fly weapon switching\n<br/>\n</li><li>A complete set of RPG skills to boost the player's capabilities\n<br/>\n</li><li>Modular ship upgrading system\n<br/>\n</li><li>Crafting system that allows the player to create new items and weapons to sell or use\n<br/>\n</li><li>A variety of available activities including mining valuable materials and exploring the vast universe\n<br/>\n</li><li>A unique chance to explore the shocking truth about the other imperial colonies and the fate of alien races\n<br/>\n</li><li>A large variety of characters with unique personalities, different questlines and factions\n<br/>\n</li><li>An engaging storyline written by Darko Macan, an official writer for numerous Star Wars and Marvel comics\n<br/>\n</li><li>A unique digital companion, ADAH, that assist the player in uncovering Bold's shady origins\n<br/>\n</li><li>Detailed interiors on different planets; visit them all!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T02:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2a0100ff2a8d7d95b1e2cb77490bc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Little Green Men Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Little Green Men Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
