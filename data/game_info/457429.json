But it's been years since anyone reached the temple, and these days terrible storms plague the ocean. Leaving is not an option. And yet, here comes young Lloyd, dreaming of adventure and itching to follow in the footsteps of his missing parents. Monsters, puzzles and dungeons await!<br/></p>\n<p>If The Lightkeeper was my tribute to <em>Metroid</em>, this game is a love letter to classic 2D <em>Zelda</em>, especially the GameBoy episodes like <em>Link's Awakening</em>. Many traditional items and enemies make an appearance as you explore the overworld or the dungeons.  The quest is complete, with 2 to 3 hours of gameplay, but updates and improvements may come later, so stay tuned!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy it. Let me know in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T04:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/3881390e08d9fcd396924b4104f3266e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atelier Dreamnoid"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
