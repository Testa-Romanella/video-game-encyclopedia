It's a little bit Maltese Falcon, a little bit CSI, and a little bit Naked Gun. The story follows detective Nick Bounty and his quest to be taken seriously as a real detective. As the case unfolds, he becomes entangled in an absurd mystery that threatens to end his life... and his newly hired partner's too!<br/><br/>The Dame with the Blue Chewed Shoe is the third game to feature Nick Bounty as the down-on-his-luck detective, but you don't need to have played either of the first two games to enjoy this one.  Each game is a stand alone story to be enjoyed on its own.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Choose 1 of 3 sidekicks to help you solve the crime and customize your experience!<br/></li><li>Fully 3D characters and environments to explore.<br/></li><li>Built from the ground up in Unity.<br/></li><li>New evidence gathering/analyzing game play.<br/></li><li>Fully Voiced by talented voice artists.<br/></li><li>Jokes out the wazoo!<br/></li><li>*Wazoo not included.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95ecf3eecdebaa461420c8a30696085.jpg", "website": "http://www.pinheadgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pinhead Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Pinhead Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
