After defeating almost every hostile unit, the remaining units will change sides and fight under your command. If you defeat a castle it will reset whenever you re-enter the Battlefield. Collect as many units, gold and XP as you can while daytime, get upgrades in your castle and get ready for the night!</p>\n<p>At nighttime you must remain in your castle and prepare for opposing waves of units in a good old-fashioned Tower Defense. Build, upgrade and fight with your towers within the castle to protect your precious gold vault they are coming for! In this version of the game you have unlimited time to explore every game mechanic.</p>\n<p><strong>Features I'm working on right now<br/></strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>finish Upgrades</li><li>more Towertypes</li><li>better Balancing</li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>Animated Unit-Sprites</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Support<br/></strong></p>\n<p>E-Mail</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/ccc7c5ef55a8065132fd0594b2477886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Immortal Virtue Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
