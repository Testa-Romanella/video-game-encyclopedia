GB", "description": "<p>A Flash classic - now in 4 Colors!<br />\nIn 2007 I released a simple Flash game series that went on to have well over 50 million downloads and destroyed productivity in countless school classrooms.<br />\nNow that Adobe have decided to pull the plug on Flash, I discovered\u00a0after much market research that\u00a0the kids of today are more interested in mobile gaming...\u00a0So I\u00a0decided to port the game to\u00a0a more viable platform -\u00a0the original GameBoy!<br />\nFaithful to the original<br />\nThis isn&#39;t\u00a0however\u00a0a cut down version - everything from the original is present -\u00a0fast action, fun physics and tonnes of on screen ships.\u00a0 Also included is the Boom-Bar, a feature added to &#39;Indestruc2Tank!&#39; to make the game feel even better.<br />\nFinally on console...kinda!<br />\nPlayable via emulator in the web browser, but also on real GameBoy hardware! The ROM file can be put onto a flash cartridge (how ironic!) or programmed to an empty cart and runs perfectly on Gameboy and Gameboy Advance!<br />\nIf this does well I also plan on doing\u00a0a limited run of original boxed cartridges produced for collectors of homebrew.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T03:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/306d8bd75bf4e4acd13e4a2bd4979437.jpg", "website": "https://incube8games.com/products/indestructotank-gb", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Antony Lavelle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
