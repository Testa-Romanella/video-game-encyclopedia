{"id": 898502, "slug": "wigmund", "name": "Wigmund", "name_original": "Wigmund", "description": "\n<br/>\nTwo twin brothers. A fellowship of warriors. And only one true King.\n<br/>\nWigmund is a story-driven RPG set up in a medieval fantasy world inspired by those cultures - Anglo-Saxon and Celtic - which also inspired J.R.R. Tolkien. Build your fellowship and explore an open-world, rich with outlaw camps, ruined castles, dangerous caverns and forgotten ruins. You are not limited by classes. Develop your knight in favor of speed, health, damage or preternatural abilities.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnique game-play for swordsmen\n<br/>\nControl Wigmund's sword with gestures, your mouse becoming an extension of his weapon. It is really different and it might take practice before you can master it. That is not all, getting out of trouble with dodges and rolls is also required! No boss fight can be a simple stand-still hack &amp; slash but an opportunity to prove your sword mastery.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMove with WASD, attack once with a left click. Swipe the mouse to your left and your hero will slash to the left, swipe the mouse to your right and your hero will slash to the right.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArchery\n<br/>\nThe archery build offers the opportunity to engage enemies form a safe(r) distance. As you might expect, this is easier to learn and use than the way of the sword.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessions\n<br/>\nWe have included three professions: Medicine, Crafting and Survival. With Medicine one will be able to craft potions for healing and elixirs that will increase stats for a longer duration. Collecting herbs will play a crucial role in this profession. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Crafting one can create some auxiliary armor pieces, item upgrades and jewels for enhancing items and weapons. Collecting animal hides and mining will be very important in crafting. And finally with Survival one will be able to fish, hunt and create different gastronomic experiences. And yes... with the proper dwarven fishing pole, one might even fish some treasure.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDetailed equipment\n<br/>\nIn addition to standard equipment items various other character equipment pieces were added, like tomes, knee-guards and arm-guards. Invest the reagents and rewards you collect along the journey in equipment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalents\n<br/>\nThere are available perks with four specializations: two handed sword (\"Sword\"), sword &amp; shield (\"Shield\"), bow (\"Ranger\") and Exorcist for a melee-caster type of build. Vendors will provide re-specialization runes that will reset all points invested in any talents and attributes for a quick in-game re-specialization for players that would like to try out more than one build.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbilities\n<br/>\nMany abilities are available. Some of them reflect the Talent/Perk system. They include (but are not limited to): a holy shield for Exorcists, a Dagger Storm for Rangers and a Shield Wall for Sword &amp; Shield warriors.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial attacks\n<br/>\nCrush your foes with devastating special attacks that will give you the upper hand in a battle.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPreternatural skills\n<br/>\nUnleash various up-gradable preternatural abilities that will aid you in battle, either defensively or offensively.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T06:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fefec305b8a6a6e40347afb9f70d7e06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 591, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Scholastics"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["The Scholastics"], "esrb_rating": null}
