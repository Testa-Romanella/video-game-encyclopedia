Push it, capture it, split it, throw it.<br/></li><li>Create amazing psychedelic liquids.<br/></li><li>Watch the fantastic patterns as surface tension and real physics forces transmogrify these amorphous masses.<br/></li><li>Watch as it collides with the walls and space station equipment.</li></ul><br/>Liquid Space is a fun simple simulation experience.  Great for learning and teaching about space, or just tinkering with for fun.<br/><br/>In the past you could only achieve this level of interactive fluid realism using a super computer.  Now you can experience this fantastic interactivity in virtual reality like never before!<br/><br/>We are thinking to include something similar into a new level in our Apollo 17 Moonbuggy VR app - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1060460/Apollo_17__Moonbuggy_VR/<br/><br/>There is no specific goal currently, this is just a simple sandbox for free play.  Have fun and give us some feedback and ideas for challenges with the liquids.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T03:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e404ec2f7aee9ab8a7673b38dd6aa28.jpg", "website": "https://www.vrxcyberspace.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VRX"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["VRX"], "esrb_rating": null}
