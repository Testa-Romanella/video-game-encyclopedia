We believe that your imagination is a weak spot. <br/><br/><ul><li>Game mechanics</li></ul> Your Breath and fear are your main weapons : There are a lot of ways to defend yourself in Dreadful but Controlling your breath and fear are your main weapons ,we have set up an AI system that will make the entity &amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot; smells and detects your fear so she will know your position if you can't control your breath so always keep an eye on your breath and heart speed .If you managed to hide or escape Mary ,the only remaining obstacle is reaching a high level of stress ,if you did then you will have a heart attack and death is certain at that point.<br/>and yes there is an INVENTORY SYSTEM ,Every object you collect helps you to solve a puzzle that's why we created an inventory system so you can check this child drawing or that picture you took with your camera. We think that the inventory is essential so you can manage your stuff and not get confused when you find something and then you have to remember it so you can use it in the next level or puzzle.<br/><br/><ul><li>Realistic Sounds</li></ul> We think that high quality sounds has a big impact on the game ,especially in a horror game ,with the power of unity 5 we've reached realistic sounds that will create an atmospheric environment and make you feel like you are there.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901b525c16cd6b93a27bcde857773699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Green Eye Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Green Eye Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
