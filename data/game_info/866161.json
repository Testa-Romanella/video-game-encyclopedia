Suddenly, your eyes darkened, as if falling into an abyss.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\"It's not saved yet!\" The sudden darkness frightened you. After confirming that it was only a power failure and not your own sudden death, you breathed a sigh of relief and went to the power distribution room to check the situation.\r\n  </p>\n<p>However, before taking a few steps, something under your feet almost made you stumble. By the light outside the window, you found that the top ten employee of the month, Mike, was dying in a pool of blood. Mike struggled to tell you that there is a killer, and you must protect company's secrets. After explaining to you the content of the work handover and the work plan for the next year, Mike died heroically. You were deeply moved by his professionalism and you decided to run away immediately.\r\n</p>\r\nControl\r\nMoveW A S DLookMouseFlashlightFInteractEMenuEsc\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Pre-made assets:</p>\n<p>POLYGON - Office Pack\u00a0 by Synty Store</p>\n<p>POLYGON - City Zombies Pack\u00a0 by Synty Store</p>\n<p>POLYGON - Icons Pack\u00a0 by Synty Store</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T13:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b304d10dbf1b5169a42120e8fb4c8d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pamisu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
