We\u00a0decided to make a game that\u00a0is\u00a0<strong>really\u00a0</strong>too big for us or this jam. This is the reason why pretty much nothing happens in the demo and why there's no autumn at all.\u00a0But we've made something (hard to call this a demo even), and we're pretty determined to continue developing it. So if you've liked the art style or characters and the story - check out this page from time to time, we will (hopefully) release updates!</p><p>Interact on Up Arrow, move left and right on Left Arrow and Right Arrow accordingly. For best experience enter the FullScreen Mode.</p><p>Art by blobasaur, programming by ezhopets, story by E.
