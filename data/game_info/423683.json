They are weak and will die after a while, but they will hurt you. Use the\u00a0<strong>health\u00a0</strong>effect to weaken entities. However, as you venture, you will find some platforms to be hidden. Switch colors to find them, however, remember that when you switch colors, you inverse effects. Now, instead of\u00a0<strong>health\u00a0</strong>weakening entities, they will be strengthened. Use this to strengthen yourself, but don't strengthen any enemies. WIth the speed effect, you can speed up or slow down entities. Survive for as long as you can!</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move - W is up, A is left, S does nothing, and D goes right.</p>\n<p>Left Click - Swap colors.</p>\n<p>Right Click - Deploy selected effect.</p>\n<p>Key 1 - Select Health Effect.</p>\n<p>Key 2 - Select Speed Effect.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming and Art - BreMea</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects - SilentDrumr (Mario Acero)</p><p>If you'd like to download the game's song, you can do so here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/393ef8c1339fc8d34f3faba9793a3d41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BreMea"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
