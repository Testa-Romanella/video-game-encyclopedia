In most cases, this sequence will win the game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1- SWORD,\u00a0 2- SWORD,\u00a0\u00a03- SHIELD,\u00a0 4- FOOD,\u00a0\u00a0 5- SHIELD,\u00a0 6- SWORD,\u00a0 7- SHIELD,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08- FOOD,\u00a0 9- SHIELD,\u00a0 10 - SWORD,\u00a0 11- SWORD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Link always attacks first and deals at least 75 damage so the game can be beaten earlier with a bit of luck and if Ganondorf has less than 75 HP. This will beat the game. To lose the game, simply attack 3 times, Ganondorf's 3rd attack will always be a 150 damaging move that the player is forced to SHIELD on. Not doing so will instantly lose you the game.</p>\n\n<p>DESIGN GOALS AND PROCESS:</p>\n\n<p>This project has taken a toll on me. I\u2019m proud though. I\u2019ve spent so long googling and researching the Twine manual for how to implement several of the game\u2019s functions. I decided on Twine because I made a game on it before, so I figured it was more of a hassle to learn how to implement something in p5 than it was to make it in Twine. I later regretted this decision because I was going for a boss fight scenario and p5 just seems much better for that than Twine. Oh well.\r\n</p>\n<p>I went into my game knowing that I needed to put Ganondorf, the Legend of Zelda villain, in there somehow. It was either some sort of story with branching paths with Ganondorf at the end or a Ganondorf boss fight. I first went for the branching paths method, but I wasn\u2019t happy with what I was making so I scrapped the project and went for the boss fight idea. I like coding a lot more than writing a story, so I had more fun with this. I originally wanted Link to go and fight lesser enemies to gain money and spend them on items in order to prepare for the Ganondorf fight, much like the games. The problem with this was that it got repetitive very quickly, playing the game for longer than 3 minutes quickly became boring. So I scrapped the lesser enemies and shop idea and sent the player to Ganondorf immediately. This worked a lot better as the game can be finished in 1-2 minutes instead.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is basically two main passages, the first is an introduction passage and the second is the actual fight. The Ganondorf fight has several passages, but it feels like it\u2019s one. I wanted to implement a strategy component to my game so I gave the player 3 options for fighting. Attacking when Ganondorf\u2019s next attack is weak, shielding when the attack is too strong, and eating food when Link\u2019s HP is too low. This is the simple pattern that is used to win. The game cannot be beaten by spamming attacks, all three fight options need to be used to beat the game.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tThe code for Twine was pretty simple but frustrating as some aspects of design are harder to implement. For example, adding a text class that when called adds a colored box around the text. The music and sound effects were definitely the most frustrating as you need the mp3 files to be hosted on some site. I was researching for practically a whole day when I discovered that itch.io helps with hosting. That was a huge relief as I really really wanted music in my game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:54:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueWalrus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
