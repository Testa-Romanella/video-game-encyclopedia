It says that in any plane surface with regions in it (people think of them as maps), the regions can be colored with no more than four colors. Two regions that have a common border must not get the same color. They are called adjacent (next to each other) if they share a segment of the border, not just a point.\" (Four color theorem.\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopaedia.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T04:40:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5eb/5ebddb4bd3e4417a05ef4ee5e9c578f2_5CvAlZr.jpg", "website": "http://color4game.weebly.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Harry Patsis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Harry Patsis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
