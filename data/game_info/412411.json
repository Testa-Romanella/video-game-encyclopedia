It wasn't just random data corruption. The Board doesn't make a mistake like that. This was a burglary.</p>\n<p>SlowAction:\u00a0Then who could have...<br/></p>\n<p>ChamberedJustice:\u00a0 Not even worth asking. The only people\u00a0 that even have remote\u00a0access to proxy\u00a0code are our own GKCorp proxy users. This wasn't a low profile operation. They took remote control of Tired_Blade, duplicated it,\u00a0and spread copies all throughout the internet using our OWN SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. ChamberedJustice:\u00a0 Here's the kicker... I checked the logs. The Board knew something was up before the proxy user even touched the blade's code. It tried to stop them-- but it was held back.</p>\n<p>SlowAction:\u00a0As it should be.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>ChamberedJustice:\u00a0\u00a0If the Board had permission to act on its own it could have STOPPED THIS. It can't do anything if it has to wait for some slow monkey to verify every move it makes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SlowAction:\u00a0 That's enough, Alex.\u00a0What does the Board think the intruder wants to do with these proxies?</p>\n<p>ChamberedJustice:\u00a0\u00a0I could'a told you that.\u00a0 It's just\u00a0a distribution of weapons to a group of terrorists.<br/></p>\n<p>ChamberedJustice:\u00a0\u00a0Why... why is it always my...</p>\n<p>SlowAction:\u00a0 Oh, duh, I suppose this is the more important part.

I'm proud of what I accomplished and learned.</p>\n<p>The game's puzzles get increasingly difficult, and get pretty unreasonable near the end. This is because I ran out of time to make well-thought out puzzles, so I put some together and played until I\u00a0could find a solution. Next time, I need to allocate more time to level-building.</p>\n<p>But I love this game idea and will probably make more levels for it in the future. I've tried for years to make a game that evokes the \"simple puzzle flash games\" that I\u00a0grew up on, and\u00a0I think I finally cracked the code; all because the limitations of a game jam forced me to keep it simple.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b348be8885719a22af1be038d3776ac6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrayWingII"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
