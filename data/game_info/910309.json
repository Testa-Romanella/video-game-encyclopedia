I decided to post the unfinished version here, however I do not plan to finish it, but I\u00a0<em>may\u00a0</em>work on it in my free time. This was purely a passion project so if\u00a0I do end up finishing it, I won't charge money.\u00a0<em>I mean, look at how bad this game is- I'd be a monster making you pay for it!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions: Move your mouse around to look around, and to move your hand.
