Two souls must pay the toll and journeytogether. One in darkness, one in light, shall forge the way ahead. Alone, they shall fail. Only together they'll be free.</em></p>\n<p>A maze game where one to two players may control a pair of souls that move independently, connected by a chain that keeps them tethered to each other. If they can reach the end of each maze, they may find their way out, or are condemned to roam forever, souls bound.</p><p><em>Music:</em></p><p><em>Ether Vox</em> by Kevin MacLeod<br/>\r\nLink: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/7014-ether-vox<br/>\r\nLicense: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/8100609205121a5123c9d1d270b21c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BrazMogu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
