For how early in the development cycle it was (it never made it out of Alpha, sadly), it was jam packed full of features: functional party system, guilds, several hundreds of items, quests, and a lot more. Sure, it wasn't the prettiest to look at, but that's what made it so charming. From an outsider's perspective, you may not see the appeal, but I assure you that playing it, especially with other people, may have you change your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Why host a server?</strong></p>\n<p>If I'm being completely honest, it's purely nostalgic for me. I spent countless hours rushing home from school and hanging with one of my best friends playing this game non-stop. I'm not sure why it was so appealing to me... I just enjoyed it. It's hard to explain. I know it seems crazy, but I'd love to see all of the old players I remember come back and play, if for nothing else than to reconnect with everyone again. A lot has changed in nearly 20 years. My love for this game has not.</p>\n<p><strong>Where is it hosted? How often will the server be on?</strong></p>\n<p>It's hosted on Amazon Web Services. The beauty of this game being so old is that it will run on just about anything as long as the prerequisites are available. I picked up a super tiny server (1 CPU, 1 GB of RAM, 30 GB of SSD), and am running with it. I honestly don't see a need for more unless more players show up and it shows signs of slowing down, but for now, that's all that's required for a seamless experience. The beauty of it? Since it's on a cloud host, I can run it 24/7. This server will always be on (as long as it doesn't crash).</p>\n<p>Take a look at the screenshots or download the client and tinker around. It's free, after all. It may not suit your fancy as it did my little 16-year-old heart back in the day, but the game was charming, ambitious, and a ton of fun to play with friends. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/95830bd7763b55a7653806c0ceaecfa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeaTeaSix"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
