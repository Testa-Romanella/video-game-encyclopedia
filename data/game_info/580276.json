Cycle through three types of weapons and fight waves of enemies off with varying effects based on the weapon in your hand!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made during the SGDA UTD game jam by Dylan Moss, Tryston Minsquero, Jonica Brooks, and Silvano Gallegos in 7 days. This was most of\u00a0our team's first game jam submission, and we had an amazing time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Github Repository :\u00a0TrystonMinsquero/SDGA-Spring-Game-Jam-2021: Game for SDGA Spring game jam 2021 (github.com)</p>\n<p>On one dreary night, hundreds of experimental creatures broke out of their confinement within a deep, underground laboratory.\u00a0 As the priests mourn and pray to the Gods for salvation, they collectively decided to not directly interfere with their believer's problems. Until one brave horn fellow stuck a deal with the three Gods. Our hero convinced the Gods of Moon, Sun, and Star that if the Gods present the brave traveler with three powerful weapons to fight against the abominations, then the entire world will become safe once again. The three gods all agreed to these terms. Thus, our adventure begins for our young hero.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Szadi art for the tileset.\u00a0https://szadiart.itch.io/2d-magic-lands-dung1</p>\n<p>Programming: Tryston, Dylan</p>\n<p>Art: Joni</p>\n<p>Map: Silvano</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315e68e2e8b7c3fd4520a6b607321154.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tryston", "J0N1", "Egos_Vanosaur", "dylantmoss"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
