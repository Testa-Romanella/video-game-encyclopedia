To fit the theme, I ditched ammo pick ups and instead you generate ammo by jumping and dashing. The combat is bullet-hell-ish so I wanted movement to not only be fun and keep you alive, but to also fuel your weapon. Platforming challenges in-between fights help keep the player's weapon fueled as well.</p>\n\n<p>M0VEMENT is fast paced and fun. Give it a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62e2a9320fa2984ddc70faeff65609c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joeganaut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
