{"id": 530520, "slug": "drugs-and-crime-idle", "name": "Drugs and Crime Idle", "name_original": "Drugs and Crime Idle", "description": "You start with $0. It's up to you to earn some money first, before you buy your first pack of weed or any other drug from the dealer and start selling it to earn some cash slowly. Rob a store to buy drugs, sell drugs, buy an apartment to hire more dealers, sell more drugs. Watch the money rise in a classic idler fashion. Don't get too comfortable tho, since the game has some fail conditions too. If the police heat gets too high and they catch you, you loose almost everything. Rivaling gangs might kill your dealers if you sell in their city too much. Hire some lawyers and thugs to keep the heat down. Later hire some chemists to cook some meth for you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is a mix between a classical idle game and a tycoon/strategy game. You cannot really just let it run in the background or you will fail, meaning that it will be somewhat more engaging than the average idle game. The average idle game gets boring after a short amount of time. I tried to make a game in the genre that is (hopefully) a bit more engaging and that actually has a fail condition. There is also no % increase as seen in most idle games. Instead, the game focuses on realism somewhat. Your first apartment will cost as much as your last one. 10 grams of weed will cost always the same amount, no matter how much you buy or sell.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI did some research on drug prices around the world to add that little bit of realism into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't expect too much from the game. It's a free to play game, meant to entertain you for a few hours, maybe a few days if you are really into it. You click buttons and watch numbers go up and down. Some of us find that kind of thing really fun. It's free so try it out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T02:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13e9b78fd46e27821a8e0d88ebb72faa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drugs and Crime Idle Dev."], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Drugs and Crime Idle Dev."], "esrb_rating": null}
