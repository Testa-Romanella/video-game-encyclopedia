You're challenged to a dual to the death. \u00a0An invitation to the Thieve's Roulette! \u00a0<br/><br/>You come to the table, unaware of the challenge you are about to face. \u00a0The sign said \"Thieve's Roultte\" but you soon realize that it was misspelled on purpose to lure in unassuming travelers. \u00a0It was mean't to say \"Roulette\" but the graphic designer must have done this on purpose!<br/><br/>The way to play is simple. \u00a0Wait for a bag to drop on the table and then press the big red button to \"SWIPE\" the bag before your opponent . \u00a0Red does damage to you, so it would probably be best to let the enemy grab those. Green heals and blue steals life from the opponent. \u00a0When the bag drops and it is one of these, GRAB IT QUICK! \u00a0These are the route to victory. \u00a0<br/><br/>Take the opponent's health to zero to win the game before they can do the same to you. \u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Credits:</p>\n<p>Raccoon_JS:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Programming\u00a0</li><li>Game Design\u00a0</li><li>Game's Original\u00a0Concept\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Joe:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Art Asset Creation</li><li>Sound Design</li></ul>\n<p>One Sound effect was used from \"SoundBible\". \u00a0Sound effect used is \"Coin_Drop\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03df9e4fc40af0171e93d0302f73ed37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Raccoon_JS", "JoeG_LTE"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
