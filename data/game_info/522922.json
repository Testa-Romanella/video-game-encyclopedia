{"id": 522922, "slug": "i-wanna-make-a-game", "name": "I Wanna Make A Game", "name_original": "I Wanna Make A Game", "description": "<p>Nightmarishly difficult platformer that pays homage to popular games.</p>\n\n<p>According to the MATLAB wiki page, \"MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\" While that may be true, what this introduction fails to convey is that MATLAB is a truly devilish program. It is user-hostile, the interface is counterintuitive, and the arbitrary changes to standard syntax conventions will leave any experienced coder irredeemably lost. Unfortunately, it is an industry-standard IDE, so the vast majority of engineering students will come face-to-face with at least one MATLAB project, and many will even come to use it in their career.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this point, a normie might be thinking to themselves,\u00a0<em>'Dame, how can I\u00a0begin to appreciate the intricacy of the\u00a0torment brought about by this progeniture of human suffering despite only being a lowly liberal arts major?'\u00a0</em>Well, luckily, I have captured the experience of learning MATLAB in this brain-dead platforming game. That's right, with little to no thought whatsoever on your part, you too can understand the pain. You can feel the same feelings, think the same violent thoughts, and wake up in the same cold sweats as the average engineering student.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T07:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bc/6bc7ef1c04b7e99a07f9b1e664d9b350.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NecroseN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
