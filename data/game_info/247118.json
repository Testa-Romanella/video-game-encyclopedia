Instead of square bricks you are dealing with water tubes. Manipulate the falling tubes to connect any two wall hoses. The rules are simple, yet the game can get very challenging on more advanced levels. The tubes don't need to fill the same horizontal line, so the whole playing field is in use which makes the game more interesting. More bonus scores for longer pipe combinations. <br/><br/><br/>FEATURES <br/><br/>- Online scores using Game Center. <br/>- Listen to game soundtracks or your own music library while playing. <br/><br/><br/>CONTROLS: <br/><br/>- Use your mouse or keyword to control the tubes<br/>- Left and Right Arrow keys to move the tubes<br/>- Up Arrow to rotate the tube<br/>- F - to freeze, B - to use bombs, H - to hold the current tube.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/9159f743c77a63ad06eaec3d0f06e72f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["LokiTap"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["LokiTap"], "esrb_rating": null}
