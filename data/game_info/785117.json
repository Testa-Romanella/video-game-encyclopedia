Most of the playtesters enjoy the dialogue with the NPCs. They Describe the dialogue to be very comedic. Some of them who are usually serious could have been heard chuckling.\u00a0 They also enjoy that I created most of the environment myself. They enjoy my audio in the game.</p>\n<p>What work did I enjoy doing? : I would say working with the audio for the game. The reason for that is that I wanted to test using audio to be used to assist the player. An example of this is the folders. I had a certain track that is always playing and that track would stop at the moment when I collected the folders. It becomes more useful the more folders you collect. Another reason why I enjoy working with the audio was that it brings out more life in a scene. Throughout the game, I had a simple ambiance of people talking but there's a selection in the mall where it's like a mini-park. In that park, I have a jukebox and a tree. Both release their own sounds. The jukebox has a song playing and the tree has birds chirping.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T16:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/590f117a7105480eecf77a23b3181d21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cristian Salazar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
