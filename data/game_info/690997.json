Investigate a political murder and bring justice to the last kingdom in the galaxy! The CYBERJUSTICE demo features a deep and rewarding turn-based battle system, character customization, shops and other miscellaneous features like save-loading, configuration options, and a glossary. This demo strips away the story and exploration elements in favor of a basic survival mode.</p>\n<p>In combat, there are two active time bars that determine when you can issue commands and when the selected action is performed. Knowing how to interrupt and outsmart your enemies, and adapting your combat strategy on the fly, is vital to success. There is also a Kill/Arrest system where players can nonviolently dispose of human opponents. It alters the rewards for combat, and the story will change based on how good or bad of a cop you are.</p>\n<p><strong>CYBERJUSTICE is still in pre-alpha development, and art assets and UI are placeholder. We'd like to use this demo to gain feedback on the combat mechanics and UI. Please let us know what you think!</strong></p>\n<p>-Team The Big Guys, 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:45:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/606/606c0f53f27977f68b3bab3ba08df9af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ithiro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
