It laps away at my consciousness, until I melt away into its embrace. Time stretches and expands, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s been minutes or days or months. </em><strong><em>I can't remember anything.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Memoria Castaway is a point-and-click visual novel with fishing minigames. Follow our protagonist as they fish their way through their\u00a0memories and, for better or worse, remember why they forgot them in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Click, Space, or Enter to interact.<br/></p>\n<p>Created for Game Off 2021.\u00a0This game may not seem like it follows the theme but I swear it will become more clear in the future. Or maybe, you've simply forgotten how it relates...<br/></p>\n<p>This is a prototype, and is not the whole game. Stay tuned for when we release the completed game! Please don't yell at us for bugs, they were intentionally added to make this prototype still meet the game jam's theme and also this was made in under a month.</p>\n<p>Known bugs: It's possible to get stuck on the fishing stage, due to fish no longer noticing the bob. If this happens, please restart the game, as it should be relatively quick to get back to the fishing stage. When back on the fishing game, try to only aim for larger fish.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game programming, background / character art, SFX by Froggo <em>(shuttlefrog @ itch / twitter)</em></p>\n<p>Narrative writing, concept / level / character design, UI programming by Kain\u00a0<em>(ethverie @ itch / twitter)</em></p>\n<p>Open source music by: MusMus, TAM Music, Purrple Cat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85aef4a1a23e1f0282d6759a25367db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ethverie", "shuttlefrog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
