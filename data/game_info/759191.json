Dash can be performed mid-air to extend air time. Has a small cooldown between uses.</li><li>Spacebar to jump. How long the Spacebar is pressed changes how high the character will jump. The character can perform a wall-jump by running towards a wall and pressing Spacebar again. Only one wall-jump can be performed while airborne. Wall-jump replenishes once the character touches the ground.</li><li>The character can also jump on other characters' heads. (Stars)</li><li>Ball can be picked up by pressing Right-click. This can only be performed within a certain range of the balll.</li><li>Pressing Left-click lauches the ball in a certain direction indicated by the arrow. Holding down Left-click instead charges the power. Releasing Left-click launches the ball, its velocity depends on how long Left-click was charged. There is a power limit, going over it will not affect velocity of the ball.</li><li>Pressing Mouse Button 4 or 5 will launch an object towards the indicator arrow. If this object collides with the ball, it will reel in the ball towards the player.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T09:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c20dc7ca80e14bffa6a63c0602545ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CatfishnChips"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
