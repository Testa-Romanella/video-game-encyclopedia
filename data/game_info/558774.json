Especially when you don't have a single clue how you got there to begin with. <br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's what Alec has to deal with tonight. It's cold, the wind's bitter, and he simply can't remember what happened earlier in the night. It must have been something big.</p>\n<p>At least he finds a bus stop for shelter, but given it's a bus stop, he's not the only one there waiting.</p>\n\n<p>Alec has two choices before him. Ignore the stranger's attempts to converse (he could be a serial killer, after all) and wait for the bus, or engage him (what else is there to do stranded at a bus stop) and see what happens. </p>\n<p>The choice is yours.</p>\n\r\n\r\nCharacters\r\n<strong><em>Alec </em></strong>\u2014 a reserved young man of few words.
