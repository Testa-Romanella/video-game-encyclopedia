The climate catastrophe has happened. Life on earth has become too hot, so humanity has had to move underground. The robots have become autonomous and sentient, and ever since, all work for humans is exclusively provided by the robots' anonymous organization \u201cCinorq\u201d. The few human rebels that exist don't stand a chance against the robot's superiority.<br/></p>\n<p>Meet Ian, a human that is actively collaborating with the robots and helping them to increase their technological advantage. <strong>Very shortly</strong>, he's going to change his mind about the robots being on his side. And a tomato incident is going to play an important role.</p>\n<p><strong>Ian needs your help.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a typical Point &amp; Click adventure game in that it sets hard puzzles to solve. <strong>A casual game this is not.</strong></p>\n<p>Ian will need to to stop the police bots from entering through his front door, and then he needs to find a different way than that door to leave the flat. Both tasks will take ingenuity, a good eye for visual clues, perseverance,and logical thinking \u201cout of the box\u201d (and yes, boxes of sorts play a role in this adventure, too!). <br/></p>\n<p>Without your determined struggle, Ian won't get out of his plight. Can you help him?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've tried to avoid the \u201cmoon logic\u201d that \u00a0Point &amp; Click adventures are infamous for, but of course, you might still get stuck. Ask in the comments, and I'll try to provide hints that don't spoil too much. <br/></p>\n<p>My first comment will give you hints to get you going. It contains some spoilers, so only read it when you're stuck at the get-go.</p>\n<p><strong>Interface</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Click on things with the left mouse button to interact with  them, e.g., to pick them up. (Ian can drop whatever he's holding onto  the table in front.)\r\n</li><li>Click on things with the right mouse button to examine them, i.e., to scrutinize them. <strong>You do need this mouse button.\r\n</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>There's a \"hamburger\" button in the top-left corner; use this for loading or saving game states or quitting the game. \r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This has in essence be a lone ride: all graphic assets, coding, music were created by me. The game is built with Adventure Game Studio written by Chris Jones and later contributors. I've used Inkscape 0.92 (inkscape.org), Synfig (synfig.org), Audacity (audacityteam.org), and a Yamaha keyboard to produce the assets. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58d0144697d165507a587512dd77995b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter G.
