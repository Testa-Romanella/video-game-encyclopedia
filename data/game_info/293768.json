It requires two (2) six-sided dice and something to write down information with. Players one and two play as two young \"Executors\" fighting on opposites sides of a war spanning the solar quadrant. These two Executors can both psychically connect\u00a0with a Proxy: mysterious, shapeshifting techno-organic constructs discovered and weaponized by both warring factions independently. Players 3 and 4 (optionally) play as the these Proxies.</p>\n<p>As the game opens, the Executors discover that they don't just share a connection with their Proxies--they're connected with each other, as well.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Game by Harry Mackin (@Shiitakeharry), art by Charlie Mackin (@Charliemander13).
