It's my first game jam, though I have been making games for years. It is, of course,\u00a0 rough around the edges, and ugly to look at, but he is my ugly son, and I\u00a0am still proud of him.</p>\n<p>I want to thank Digital Mantis's 'Yon paradox' - my inspiration.</p>\n<p>Also thanks to Slef for the name, and by S.O. for being the best!</p>\n<p>\"You wake up on the floor of your laboratory. Lab coat burnt, eyebrows missing but.. What this? Your time machine is finished?\u00a0And it's on?! Oh no!\u00a0In only a few moments I will be coming out of that chamber - and I didn't see myself so that means. I have to get out of here! I know what i have to do - unlock all of the security puzzles in my lab to get my ray gun - then end this nightmare by killing all my past selves!\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to a current bug in Unity (2020.1.0-2020.1.7), this could not be uploaded as a web app - which means I have done my best to provide Windows, Mac and Linux, builds, so I\u00a0hope they work for yall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, I'm on hour 17 of straight coding -what a rush- lets wrap this up.
