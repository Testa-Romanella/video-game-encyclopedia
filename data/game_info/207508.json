Its unfinished and pretty terrible.<br/></p>\n<p>Puzzle platformer. Control different bodies to get the key and reach the door (you are some kind of evil top hat organism).</p>\n<p>Arrows: Move<br/>Z: Jump<br/>C: Shoot hat. Press up to shoot upwards.<br/>R: Reset level.<br/><br/>Small gentlemen jump higher and fit in small places. Fat gentlemen break some blocks, push other blocks, and are bigger, and can be used as a way to reach higher places.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Kudos to Chevyray, for the awesome flashpunk, and Noel Berry, for the Advanced Platforming Engine I used in this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/71975f58a30d7ac281857e7185da9d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maikel Ortega"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
