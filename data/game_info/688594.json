The color of the ball on the top menu will tell you what color will be the balls that you have to remove. When you finish eliminating all the balls of that color, the menu ball will indicate another color for you to eliminate those balls as well. You must eliminate all the balls before time runs out.<br/>To delete them you just have to click on them. But beware! If you remove a ball of a color other than the ball from the menu, you will have a penalty. If you are penalized three times, you will lose the game.<br/><br/>In the game there are four worlds and within each world you have five levels. You will have to go through each level for the next to be unlocked. In each level you can get stars. The first star indicates that you have passed the level without making any mistakes. The second star indicates that you have beaten the level within a specified time and the third star indicates that you have beaten the level with a minimum number of scores.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/><br/>Sometimes special balls can appear. There are three types:<br/>- The incognito ball: represented by a question mark removes all the balls of the same color.<br/>- The time ball: stops the timer for three seconds.<br/>- The freezer ball: freezes all the balls for a short period of time.<br/>The \"black ball\" may also appear. You should not eliminate it because if you do, all the balls will start to shake for five seconds and it will be difficult for you to eliminate them.<br/><br/>Will you be able to overcome all the levels getting all the stars?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:00:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/061345074fce84998e16f343b152a5fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLEsoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
