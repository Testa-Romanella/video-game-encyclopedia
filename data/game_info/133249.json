You who dare release the very power of creation which they jealously maintained as their sole domain.<br/><br/>You who cannot escape.<br/><br/>Although your fate is sealed, your victory, too, is assured, for what you let loose can not so easily be regathered.<br/><br/>And so, before your liver is eaten by birds forever, spread chaos far and wide. As your ship is punctured, chaos will slip loose and return to the power of creation to the universe. The further you fly, the further and faster it can spread, and the harder it will be for the Corporation to recover.<br/><br/>But, beware!<br/><br/>Although chaos is a powerful tool, it is also a dangerous ally.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Mouse - Aim/Steer</p><p>Mouse Button - Shoot</p><p>M - Mute</p><p>Esc - Exit to Menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2aa02999863708fccc890e03a822cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tales of the Renegade Sector"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
