{"id": 851223, "slug": "jjs-ubermon-journey", "name": "JJ's Ubermon Journey", "name_original": "JJ's Ubermon Journey", "description": "<p>Welcome to Ubermon Island! The place where you can find these creatures known as Ubermon which can be used for battling to help you become the top Ubermon master! Here you play as a young girl named JJ on a journey to explore the island and discover all kinds of Ubermon. You are there with another individual named Asher who is currently the top Ubermon master and has claimed the best Ubermon for himself! He's always been a jerk to everybody and likes to show off his Ubermon collection, and he doesn't like it when people get in his way. What a brat! Can you find all the Ubermon and beat Asher at Ubermon training?</p>\n<p>What's that? Are you saying this game is very similar to an already existing game that has been available on the marketplace for many generations? NAH!!! You must be mistaken! This is clearly original work, and resembles nothing else. What's wrong with you?</p>\n<p>All jokes aside, this was actually a birthday gift I made for my girlfriend since she loves Pok\u00e9mon so much. We've been together for a long while now, so I felt like making something special for her. This also took me two months to make, by the way. :P</p>\n<p>Your party:\r\n</p>\n<p>You will always be carrying four carrier Uberballs with you which you can fill with any Ubermon you desire for your team. To do this, simply Left-click on an Uberball from the inventory, then Right-click on one of the four carrier Uberballs on the top-right corner of your screen to put it in. Once the carrier Uberballs are equipped, you can Left-click on them to preview the current Ubermon that it's holding. To reset your carrier Uberballs, just Left-click the \"reset\" button. When you start playing for the first time, you will begin with two randomly chosen starter Ubermon.</p>\n<p>Catching an Ubermon:\r\n</p>\n<p>When an enemy Ubermon reaches about 25% of its initial HP, a command option will appear which will give you the opportunity to capture it. However, it is a 1 to 4 random chance to capture it. If you capture an Ubermon that you already have, then that Ubermon will just level up.</p>\n<p>Pro tip:\r\n</p>\n<p>Each area has a certain number of unique spots where you might find a rare Ubermon. Once you find these spots, just walk around it to find a rare Ubermon and fight it.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Click stuff<br/>(If you're not comfortable using WASD, you can press Ctrl+Y, then click on the check mark on keyboard for player 1 to change the movement controls to your liking.)</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following.
