But, I think when I tried to expend this idea with the reanimated bodies I think I wasn't able to create interesting mechanics with it (during the jam time) to justify this mechanic, and was already too late for me to throw it away and just use the core mechanic of the lampion shoots its own soul, because I didn't have any kind of danger or element in the game to create the level design beyond the reanimated bodies...</p>\n<p>So I decided to let for you guys to judge if this mechanics was good or not, I really liked the core concept of the lampion and I think I will implement it in a future game!</p>\n<p><strong>BROWSER NOTES:</strong>\u00a0There is still some bugs in the browser version that I'm looking into solve them, when you die in the water drops the game may crash, this can be mitigate if you stay a little time in the level each life. The downloadable versions runs better in this aspects and doesn't have this bug. <strong>[THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED, IF THE ERROR PERSISTS PLEASE TELL ME]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-------------SOFTWARES USED-----------</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding: Visual Studio (C#)\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Procreate, Photoshop\r\n</p>\n<p>Music: Garage Band for Mac (using apple loops)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: I reused some effects of the game Censer Eminence in this game</p>\n<p>Font: Iloopfont (made by me for the game Iloopnati\u00a0)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06c1047caec44252cd304f2a743a0aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Gat Car"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
