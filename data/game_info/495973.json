When an argument with another classmate spurs the hot-tempered Sage to run off alone into the woods, Olive follows her, hoping to lift her spirits and make sure she\u2019s safe. But the bubbly and energetic Heather has the same idea, and tensions between her and Sage threaten to turn the trip into even more of a disaster than it is already. Olive just wants her classmates to get along, but they seem to disagree on everything\u2014and to make things even worse, they\u2019ve lost track of how to get back to their campsite! Follow three stressed-out teens on a journey full of bickering, mosquitoes, and self-discovery.</p>\n<p><em>Take A Hike! </em>takes approximately 30-45 minutes to read, and includes audio captioning and adjustable textbox opacity for accessibility (available in the preferences menu). It<em> </em> also contains some strong language, brief references to drug use, mildly sexist remarks, and characters generally being grumpy and rude to each other a lot.</p>\n<p>All character sprites used in Take A Hike! are available for purchase from DejiNyucu! You can get them and use them in your own game!
