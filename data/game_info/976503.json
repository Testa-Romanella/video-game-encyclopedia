Sensual Slots offer you a classic game of slots with an adult twist. Line up three or more symbols from left to right to win cash or even a bonus game. Match the featured symbols to view each of the games characters in their natural beauty. Based on the now classic slot machines of the 2014 era!<h3>New To Slots?</h3><br/>The goal of slots is to match 3 or more of the same symbol to win. The first reel is the most important because you must match symbols from left to right starting with the first reel. <br/><br/>There are four main symbols that win big amounts, some basic symbols based on a deck of cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten) that can win medium amounts and there are also three special symbols which we will explain below.<br/><br/><strong>Wild:</strong> The Wild symbol can match any other symbol in the game (except other special symbols)<br/><br/><br/><strong>Scatter:</strong> The Scatter symbol is special because you can win just by having three or more of them on the screen in any position (hence the name scatter because they can be scattered about the reels).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you get three bonus symbols you enter a bonus game where you win free spins and keep all the winnings from enjoying those spins.<br/><h3>Other Options</h3><br/><strong>Lines:</strong> There are three obvious lines you can match symbols on across the play area, but you can also match symbols on lines that aren't as obvious. By clicking the lines button you can see the lines being checked for matching symbols.<br/><br/><strong>Denominations:</strong> You can choose to play a penny per line or $10 per line each spin.<br/><br/><strong>Bet:</strong> The bet multiplier is how many coins based on your denomination you want to bet on each line per spin.<br/><br/>Example: If your denomination is set to 1 cent, your bet multiplier is set to 1 and you are playing 20 lines per spin, each spin will cost 20 cents a spin [1x1x20].<h3>SPECIAL FEATURES - Slot Cabinet Owners</h3> <strong> CONTROLLER SUPPORT</strong><br/><br/>Being a slots enthusiasts with real slot machines we have noticed that there is no software out there designed to work in a slot cabinet (or PC for that matter) that feel like the real slot machines (they always have extra user interface stuff on the screen that ruins the real feel of the slot game). So we made this software to fill that gap and intend to make many more (adult and non-adult) based slot games.<br/><br/>We have a special feature for slot cabinet builders / owners. We've included the ability to use a USB joypad encoder to play the games using a real slot machines buttons. The games fit a Ceronix type monitor at 1280x 1024 perfectly and feel like a real sot machine. 4:3 and 19:9 screen modes supported. We plan to add move cabinet features in future updates. If you have an old non-working slot machine or even a working slot machine with a multiple input monitor (many are, you should check) You can put a cheap computer into your slot cabinet and have the best of both worlds!<br/><br/>If you are playing on your PC, in a real Slot Cabinet, or building your own slot machine.. we have you covered and want to help make it a simple and fun project!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T13:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b8f6e1715c67e0522ea42eb1518d41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Depiction Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dragom"], "esrb_rating": null}
