The left paddle is a CPU which the player will play against.<br/> <em>Multiplayer:</em><br/> Two players control the right and left paddles.<br/> The left paddle is controled by the 'w' and 's' keys while the right paddle is controlled by the up and down arrow keys.<br/> The goal of the game is to score goals against your opponent. This is done by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.<br/> The first player to get 5 goals wins the match.</p>\r\n Additional Features:\r\n<p> The ball speeds up after every paddle hit. Once a goal is scored, the paddle resets to its initial speed.<br/> Powerups will spawn every 10-30 seconds.<br/> They are activated immediately when the ball makes contact with them.<br/> Three powerups are available which affect speed, direction, and quantity.</p>\r\nArt Aspects:\r\n<p>\u00a0We went for a simplistic, Neon design. We changed the color of the paddles, text, and\u00a0<br/> balls to a blueish teal and made the menu buttons a darker blue. The background was also changed to black.<br/> We slimmed up the paddles and ball to make for a more modern gaming experiance and created new icons to represent the\u00a0<br/> various powerups.\u00a0</p>\r\nSound:\r\n<p> All sounds were created using the BeepBox online sound editor.<br/> Sound was implemented in a variety of locations throughout the game to give the players a more emmersive experience.\u00a0<br/> Background music was created. This music speeds slightly up when playing to represent the increasing speed of the ball.<br/> The music also resets to its standard speed after each goal is made.<br/> A countdown timer noise was created for the begining of each round.<br/> A extra beed along with some audiance cheering occurs after each goal is scored.<br/> A small beep occurs after a power up is picked up.<br/> Different clicks are made when the ball hits the wall and paddle.</p>\r\nData tracking:\r\n<p> The Score and game counter are constantly displayed throughout the game.<br/> Additional statistics can be displayed by pressing 'i'.<br/> These include thew number of hits in the round, the total number of hits, the total number of hits for each person,\u00a0<br/> The time elapsed for the entire match, the longest round, each players current win streak(one will always be zero),<br/> and the longest win streak.\u00a0<br/> These statistics are reset after each match, but can be reset sooner by clicking the reset statistic button within the\u00a0<br/> extra statistics menu. Note: this does not reset the toal round timer or the game score.</p>\r\nGame Control:\r\n<p> A new game can be started by either clicking the home button (top left) and starting a new game or by\u00a0<br/> clicking the restart button (top right).<br/> The player(s) may reset the statistics by either starting a new game or clicking the 'reset statistics' button\u00a0<br/> within the extra statistics menu.<br/> The player can quit the game by clicking the home button to go back to the main menu or the 'x' on the top right of the\u00a0<br/> window to exit the game entirely.<br/> There is also an 'X' in the main menu which can be used to quit the application.<br/> When the match has ended additional buttons appear allowing the player(s) to rematch or return to the main menu.</p>\r\nGame Twists:\r\n<p> Added main menu.<br/> Added solo option.<br/> Added automated playing of paddles when in the main menu.<br/> Added powerups.<br/> Added countdown before each ball is launched.<br/> Ball speeds up over time in each round.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T04:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/037a52debecf24e37854a70829fdb37a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kianweimer"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
