Expect QTE to survive traps, a lot of exploration and some riddles to solve.</p>\n<p>Being a tribute to the old Dungeon Crawlers, <strong>it will be better for you to arm yourself with squared paper and pen, they will be useful</strong>, especially in the final part... hint hint...</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made in 2015 for a Labyrinth Contest, so it's a relatively short project that I created in about 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>As usual, I wanted to try something different than the standards of RPGMaker 2003, creating an engine to have a first person dungeon crawler.</p>\n<p>A few years has passed since then, and today I have finally decided to correct a few things, add a more personal touch and, above all, translate it into English, with the help of my friend OldPat, whom I thank very much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d3c6851f3975426cfa5ad8d5db4bd06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Testament"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
