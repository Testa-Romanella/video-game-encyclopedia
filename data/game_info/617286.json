The satellite gains intelligence by harvesting asteroids and enhancing its technology. Eventually, the AI invents warp tech, but it costs the mass of a star to fuel a warp. In pursuit of the AI's goal, it consumes entire solar systems while being very successful in its purpose.\r\n\r\nHow To Play:\r\n* Send out probes to connect to planets and collect their resources.\r\n* Collect materials from reachable planets to use in the upgrade menu to upgrade your satellite.\r\n* Once you feel the time is right, mine the sun to fuel your warp.\r\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\n\r\nLeft click on a planet to send out probes (multiple can be sent depending on your upgrades).\r\nRight click on a planet to retrieve all probes connected to it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2940e7a5ffc6241c6346901968f059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["OVERTIME"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
