Whether she actually likes you or not, there's no denying that you work well together, forming an easy routine in and outside of the workplace. She's a tough one to get to know, keeping you at a distance, as though there is a secret she's concealing from anyone who might get too close. You can sympathize. One thing is certain, she always knows more than she lets on. Or, at least, that's the impression she gives off.\r\n</p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p>A waiter by night and [REDACTED] by day. Though never caught with his hands dirty, he's suspected of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] as well as extortion. Though he appears perfectly friendly, the easy demeanor doesn't last long after his facade crumbles. The few people who got to see his true face describe him as superficial and cunning, though personally, Reed has always preferred the term 'adaptable'.\r\n</p>\n<p>Team Sigma's Commanding Officer.\u00a0Around the office, Laurent has been called cold and unpleasant.
