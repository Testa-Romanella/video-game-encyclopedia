Godot is truly awesome.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You have a single bullet, which you can fire by clicking. It will ricochet off walls and enemies, but you need to pick it up to use again. You get points per hit, and hitting multiple enemies with a single bullet gives you combos and increases your points.</p>\n<p>The longer you survive, the more different enemies will appear. There are 4 different types: basic (red), tough (purple), fast (green), and... highly combustible (yellow).</p>\n<p>The highest score I've been able to achieve is only 1800 (which is a little depressing...)</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:36:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a1e557640f3fb59bc5940bab887d26e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Robotham"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
