You can purchase it here\n<br/><br/>\nExperience the four individual stories of characters knee-deep in madness. Being completely different people, they have their own burdens to overcome in order to be able to see the greater picture and play their part in this tragedy. The gangster, the nun, scholar, and a bookworm: how could they be connected when they've never even met each other? Just pull one thread and watch the whole web come into action.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will have to kill a lot of strange and terrible creatures in your way. They are here to consume you so there is not much of a choice really. The comfort of turn-based combat allows for a tactical approach: take your time, find the enemy's weakness and strike. Except you\u2019ll never face the same enemy twice, so make sure to utilize all the abilities of your party members if you wish to prevail.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the city of Gris which contains many secrets too dangerous to be left alone. It\u2019s up to you to save the realm and guide the heroes to a fulfilling life they are looking for. Or succumb to the void and watch them perish.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T06:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/1798b8f80ca27b302ee1a9c844690796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sezhes"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ravenage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
