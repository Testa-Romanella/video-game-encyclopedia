And although gameplay was not a part of it, I felt like adding a souls-like flare for the fun of it.\r\n</p>\r\nFromSoftware Inspirations\r\n\r\n<p>Decypress takes heavy inspiration from the Dark Souls and Bloodborne games by FromSoftware, and while not polished- fans will see some similarities to entertain themselves for a short while.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n<p>Decypress is a game by Scott Warren (Sayincraft Studios), and TongYe 'Haztyr' Zhang.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game Design, Level Design, Game Direction, Programming, characters, and all things visual was made by Scott Warren (Sayincraft Studios).\r\n</p>\n<p>Narrative dialogue, story, characters, and game music by TongYe 'Haztyr' Zhang.\r\n</p>\r\nGame Tech Info\r\n\r\n<p>This game is designed to be run on a 64 bit Windows PC.

Controllers have very minor partial support.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game does not have any save features, so be wary about quitting the game.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p>W.A.S.D to move.
