{"id": 414007, "slug": "before-the-war", "name": "Before The War", "name_original": "Before The War", "description": "<p>Before The War is a 3D FPS where the player is immersed in the skin of a soldier deployed on an island just before the war. The player will have to find an NPC that will give him quests to complete in order to win gold. It is with this gold that the player will be able to equip himself with weapons and protections. But beware, players can also kill each other.<br/>At the start, the player is equipped with a Glock 18. This is the basic weapon. The map is an island divided into 6 zones. During the first 5 minutes, each player will have to loot himself as best as possible, because this is the only time when invisible barriers protect you.<br/>This FPS differs by its loot system, where you have to manage your time, the choices you make with the NPC, and also remain discreet.<br/>The damage is very extensive localized damage.<br/>The game will be played solo, against 5 players: 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1</p>\n<p>As the game community grows, we will add trio mode. The best player of his team from the previous game will be able to choose his two other teammates.</p>\n<p>As the community is small, it is possible that you will be alone on the map. So I advise you to play against your friends, or to join our discord server to be able to meet other players: https://discord.gg/dZaQD7J.</p>\n<p>************************************************************************************</p>\r\nVersion 0.1.a1<br/>Sunday, February 23rd<br/><strong>Release of the alpha version on PC</strong><br/>- Adding the lobby<br/>- Creation of a matchmaking system<br/>- Creating a map\r\n<br/>- Creation of widespread damage<br/>- Movement creation<br/>- Creation of the 6-player multiplayer<br/>- Creation of a player prototype<br/><br/><br/><p>Twitter :\u00a0@Before_The_War<br/></p>\n<p>Discord : https://discord.gg/dZaQD7J.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c16dcd8d0786ff600bcb2944e0b155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AdriFid"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
