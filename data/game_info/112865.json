{"id": 112865, "slug": "forerunner", "name": "Forerunner", "name_original": "Forerunner", "description": "<p>This 30-day RPGMaker contest remake of a Ludum Dare entry puts you in the role of the <strong>Forerunner</strong>, a trick flyer turned military courier who takes dangerous routes to ensure his cargo's secrecy.</p><p><strong>Forerunner </strong>is best described as a rhythm-based rail-flyer; Starfox meets Bit.Trip Runner. Narrowly avoid obstacles to build boost power, then race for your best time through multiple environments synced to original music tracks.</p><p>This game is designed to be used with a controller, but can be used with the keyboard as well. WASD/Arrow keys to move/select and Space to confirm/boost. Controller bindings may vary by system (only one was tested), but generally movement is the Left Stick/D-Pad, boosting is the Left Trigger, and selection is Start.</p><p>While this game was based on a Ludum Dare game, they share no resources or code base whatsoever. This was my first exploration into using the Unreal engine, while the game jam entry was made with Unity.</p><p>This project was designed and programmed primarily by Piers Excell-Rehm, with environmental assets, UI, and SFX created by Joel Arbuckle. Special thanks to Jon Bash for his 2 original tracks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21bf569c39b960f0579e709e637b41bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piers Mana"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
