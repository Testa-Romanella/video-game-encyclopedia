For example, to pierce the face of your opponent. But not directly - in the process of playing baseball.</p>\n<p>You can play six characters on seven rings.</p>\n<p>Anti-gravity ball with each stroke accelerates from the speed of the turtle to supersonic speed. Every fifth hit allows you to use a special trick. Each character in the reserve has a pair of very peculiar ways to drive the ball right into the opponent&#39;s face. For example, such techniques as acceleration or deceleration of the ball. As a result of using these techniques, the game can obviously become much shorter or stretch in time.</p>\n<p>There are three game modes. Online, estra and versus.</p>\n<p>Network mode tracks players with a legal copy of LL. This mode allows you to find an opponent with geolocation. Knowing the location of the proposed enemy, you can choose for the fight those whom you know.</p>\n<p>The second option &quot;extra&quot; allows you to compete with the computer, improve your playing skills and the speed of reaction to the ball flying towards the face. Also this option allows you to pump your team, opening new skill levels and increasing the palette of skins.</p>\n<p>The third option makes it possible to form teams for the game &quot;two vs two&quot;, which gives dynamics to a murderous match.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2014-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T16:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65b9b6c96f093df897d14844e7b60819_bcrhbi4.jpg", "website": "http://lethalleague.team-reptile.com/", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1909, "beaten": 66, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 90, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 185, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 185, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Team Reptile", "Reptile Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Reptile"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
