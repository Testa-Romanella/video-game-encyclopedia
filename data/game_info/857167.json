In particular, the puzzles are loosely based on the IAD Word of the Year from 2014-2021: Assumptions, Communication, Curiosity, Database, Quality, Security, Resilience and Evidence.<br/></p>\n<p>This experience is single-player, but lends itself to being tackled collaboratively. The puzzles are entirely self-contained, requiring no outside knowledge. Googling is allowed, but not required to solve any puzzle. A pen and paper may be handy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T10:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b5da25e39e2620739e5e327a647e2c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dane Perry Svendsen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
