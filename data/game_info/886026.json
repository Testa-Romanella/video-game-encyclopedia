Hell, there's many commercial games which are far more punishing than what Mighty Jill Off asks you to overcome - but the point isn't about just that 'games players are masochists'. It's that 'games designers are sadists', in the sense of a Master/Slave relationship. In that, it's a question of trying to punish your slave in a way which makes it a relationship. True sadism would just involve offing the little shit. The point is to make them suffer in a way which they can endure and - by tickling those desires -\u00a0</em>enjoy.<em>\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2014Kieron Gillen, Rock Paper Shotgun</em></p>\n<p><strong>Mighty Jill Off\u00a0</strong>is an indie platform game from 2008.
