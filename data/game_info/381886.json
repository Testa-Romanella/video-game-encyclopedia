SAM has already programmed the moves it\u2019s going to take to get to the POWER FLOPPY and it\u2019ll be your job to build the level! You will start with nothing on the board, and SAM will only start it\u2019s movement protocol once there\u2019s nothing left to be placed on the board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You will need to strategically plan and take care with where you place the tiles! If your placement isn't quite where you want it, simply RIGHT CLICK on any tile to remove it. SAM will execute it\u2019s pre-programmed movement sequence even if it sends it flying off into the void of space or into a hazardous laser beam. On top of this, SAM will only pick up the POWER FLOPPY once it\u2019s completely finished it\u2019s movement protocol.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Levels 1-1 to 1-3 are designed to teach you the basics of the game as well as what each tile can do. Levels 2-1 to 2-3 are designed to challenge you and push you to the very limits. The CHAOS level is only for those with the courage to face the unknown. This game mode randomly generates levels ranging from very easy to nightmarishly unfair!\u00a0If you ever find yourself completely lost, press the Escape key to restart the map or go back to the main menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:57:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9adb573c4e8a660983b31dfcb54052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Inflatable Cactus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
