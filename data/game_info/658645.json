The weather had not been kind to them on this day and his boots were soaked clean through. He swatted a mosquito away from his pale grey skin and looked up towards the roiling, clouded sky. They still had three more days on the road and only enough food to last for two of them if they really stretched it. Farsel handed over her waterskin from her waist and knelt down beside him, patting his shoulder with a smile. He took a hearty slug of the cool liquid and nodded to her. He rose, slinging the heavy sack back across his broad shoulders. Just three more days.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>- Twisy Gingerbread,\u00a0What the Others Did\r\n</p>\n<p>Campfire is an elegant travel system created for D&amp;D Fifth Edition.
