The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.\r\n\r\nGame Description\r\nUp We Go!\r\nis a local Multiplayer Platformer. <br/>One player has to survive the rising lava by jumping on objects which the second player places.<br/>You have to work as a team to get the highest score!\r\nAre you capable of working as a team and fighting agains the physics system? \r\n\r\n<em><strong>Controles:</strong></em>\n<em>_______________________________Player 1________________________________</em>\n<em>Move Mouse\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -&gt; Move Player<br/>Left Mouse Click -&gt; Let Objects Fall<br/><br/></em>\n<em>_______________________________Player2_________________________________</em>\n<em>Spacebar -&gt; Jump<br/>A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; Move Left<br/>D\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; Move Right</em>\n\r\nRepository Link\r\n<p>Up We Go!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>This prototype was created at the\u00a0GameDesign//UE\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Applied Sciences Europe.
