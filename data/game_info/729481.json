If you've enjoyed playing it, you can vote for it here! (I am also two-timing this by submitting it in the Finally Finish Something jam too, because I haven't finished a project in a while)</p>\n\n<p>They say you have been on board the longest. How long? You are not quite sure, not anymore. You do not remember a time before the <em>SPS Iron Hammer</em>. You don't know how you even ended up on this spaceship to begin with. You just seemed to have appeared one day onboard, as many have before you and many more have after. You were give a suit, <strong>#8019</strong>, and some menial tasks to complete every day.</p>\n<p>Ensure that these are done in a timely manner and avoid causing any trouble, and you will spend your life content and taken care of. Failure to comply, <em>and well...</em> You are no quite sure, but you'd rather not find out yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Until now, your life onboard of the <em>SPS Iron Hammer </em>has been quite pleasurable. Since you've set foot on this ship, you had need for nothing, nor wanted anything. Sure, not remembering a single thing prior to your arrival is peculiar, but no one else on the ship remembers their life either. To be honest, you are not sure you would want to remember either. You would rather not want to learn anything negative about your past life... or yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>For a long time, all of this was sufficient to you. You were quite happy with your life onboard the <em>SPS Iron Hammer</em>. Until this new crew member appeared, Jake he called himself. A loner peculiar young man who will confide in you, if you allow him to. A secret that will change your life.\r\n</p>\n<p>Between choosing to live your life in peaceful bliss and finding the truth, how will you reconcile your place on the <em>SPS Iron Hammer</em>?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> some animation (timed text, blinking text), foul language and swearing, mention of violence, mention of death, mention of bodily harm.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T03:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0070abe62b9f191304faeb0c0faf144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manonamora"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
