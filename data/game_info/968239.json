You are a front gate security officer on their first day of the job at the Kurzmann Laboratory, a research center focusing on medical innovations and pharmaceuticals through their discoveries in the meat pit. Oh yeah there's a giant meat pit, in case you didn't notice. Your first day turns into a nightmare when you are told to do the one thing you're not supposed to do: jump into the pit! From then on it is a grueling battle to destroy the pit. It won't be easy as there are creatures down there, none of them friendly.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Six Meat Under (6MU) is a first-person, medium-pace, horror, shooter. At the start of the game you get a flashlight and a pistol (with unlimited ammo of course). As you progress through the game, you will encounter many enemies, puzzles, and even some lore. You also will find additional weapons to assist you on the enemies ahead. Your goal: to destroy the pit, a huge task for just one person, but not impossible.<br/><br/>Non-English translation were provided by Google Translate and may be very incorrect.<br/>6MU was inspired by the Mystery Flesh Pit National Park internet archive by Trevor Roberts, so huge thanks to him!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T05:02:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb3ddb60d4081c7a5513c762a6c61ddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Clockwork Oblivion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Clockwork Oblivion"], "esrb_rating": null}
