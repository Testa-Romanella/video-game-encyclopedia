P to pause.\u00a0M to mute background audio track if you don't want it to play, after game is started.</p>\n<p>I made this game as both a tribute to my love of 80s Atari arcade games, and to learn the raylib library in C++, using raylib 4.5 release. This version is as close to the orginal as I've ever gotten. I played the game for hours while making it. I also found more information on the orginal making of the game. I have a new handheld with the Arcade ROM so that helped too. No pixels were hurt during the making of this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T09:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/0254c70a267748746bd3c1064ff0b550.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purple Knightmare Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
