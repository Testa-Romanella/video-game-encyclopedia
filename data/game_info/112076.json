Sometimes the player will no longer be able to shoot while grinding. When this bug occurs, attempting to shoot while grinding will launch the player off of the pillar instead of shooting. If this issue occurs, pause the game and restart from checkpoint.</p>\n<p>2. While aiming with your guns sometimes the target in your crosshair will sometimes not take damage which is indicated by a lack of a bullet impact sound (Targets which can be damaged are enemy ships and boss weakspots). If this happens try to shoot the target from a different angle or alter your character's angle on the currently grinded pillar using Q or E (LEFT and RIGHT SHOULDER on controller).</p>\n<p>3.
