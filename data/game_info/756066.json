She waits, in stasis, feeling the call of that\u00a0<em>something</em> but being unable to act on it. But when she meets a sketchy talking dog in the woods one day offering her magical powers, she might just get the chance to break free of that stagnation.<br/></p>\n<p>Now Chloe must work to learn and grow into her powers, while doing her best to use them to help the people around her. And there's no shortage of people to help, now that the town has been overrun with strange monsters. Chloe leaps into action to save whoever she can -- and though capturing hearts at the same time isn't her\u00a0<em>primary</em>\u00a0aim, she certainly won't say no if it happens along the way!<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Magic Unlocked: Chloe is a platformer / dating sim made for the 5th Magical Girl Game Jam, and is the first installment in the overarching Magic Unlocked series. Hop through various levels to fight monsters and other magical girls, save your friends, and slowly get the impression that fourteen year old girls maybe aren't the most reliable narrators.</p>\n<p>The current Jam version contains one story level and two character routes. Happy endings not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<ul><li>Music done by\u00a0Zeffen.</li><li>Game made in GameMaker Studio, dialogue system courtesy of Friendly Cosmonaut.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/561b4cd1e5833f1e2c95ee5dfe5b8c73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lime"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
