I'm David, and I am currently conducting a research project on game design. As part of this project, I\u00a0am writing this game,\u00a0<em>Prism</em>, as part of an effort to assist and inspire aspiring game developers by heavily documenting its development journey and design process, as well as fully releasing its files. As such,\u00a0this demo of\u00a0<em>Prism</em> as well as all future builds will be completely free and open-source, for anyone to use for whatever they want. The goal of this demo is simply to show off potential game mechanics that will be in the final release, and to solidify the general artistic style. GunTurtle will be helping me out with art in the future! Stay tuned for more releases.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<ul><li>Press Z to start.</li><li>Move with the arrow keys.</li><li>When you're standing over a laser, press Z or X to adjust the laser angle. The goal is to get a pink laser to the pink target in the lower right.</li></ul>\n<p>FEEDBACK / BUGS:</p>\n<p>Please post to the community tab if you have any feedback or bugfinds! Please remember that this is only a demo, but I will be improving on this build for several months. Thanks!</p><p>SOURCE:</p><p>https://bit.ly/3nCrT0x<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dcd0685eaf89af6ad2ea4f229b0a700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Retrisma"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
