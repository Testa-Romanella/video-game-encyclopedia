We're calling it \"Stranger Things Tiger Edition.\"\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe're not affiliated with Netflix in any way; we're just tremendous fans of the show and the world they've so meticulously created. Once we saw Mike's design we knew we needed to make it playable, and at last our labor has paid off!<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe really hope you enjoy playing and please let us know what you think! Also, don't forget to check out Mike who you can find on Twitter &amp; Dribbble.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Concept</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tControl Eleven as she tries to rescue all of the boys and keep them safe. Avoid the government agent and Demogorgon at all costs. Eat waffles for energy, and use your telekinetic powers to throw the enemies back against the walls (but be careful, this takes a toll on Eleven).\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Arrow keys to move</li>\n<li>X to use a key</li>\n<li>C to use telekinesis</li>\n<li>On-screen buttons fully work as well</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><ul><li>Design - Mike Donovan<ul><li>Web</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Dribbble</li></ul></li><li>Development and Sound - Alex Porter<ul><li>Web</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Instagram</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e54ec630477b835b36cffc49067e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Curiosity Motive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
