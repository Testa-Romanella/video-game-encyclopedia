Difficult to beat as I ran out of time to get a proper system for finding the exit location, although it's still possible.</p>\n<p>trello if you want to see how I did / didn't do:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/PSZIS1uh/acumen-scorespace-10</p>\n<p>\u00a0very unfinished - missing tons of features that I wanted initially.</p>\n\n<p>also kinda hard sorry about that :)</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>E - open inventory (left click to move items, left click outside of the inventory to drop items, c to rotate current item, 1, 2 to equip items)</p>\n<p>Q - open crafting menu (w / s, scroll, up / down arrow to navigate, c to craft)</p>\n<p>WASD - move character</p>\n<p>Left shift - sprint</p>\n\n<p>Info:</p>\n<p>The monster will track you down after a while. Find a compass and map on a dead corpse and work your way towards the door icon on the map. Your current position will not be displayed on the map, but your spawn location is represented by a red X.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teas can be crafted in the crafting menu. Aloe tea will boost your energy, and your sanity slightly. Flower tea will boost your sanity, and your energy slightly.</p>\n<p>Campfires can be crafted, which prevent you from losing sanity whilst on.</p>\n<p>Sleeping bags can also be crafted, which allow you to sleep and recharge your energy and stamina.</p>\n\n<p>Once your sanity and energy are depleted, the monster can kill you.</p>\n<p>The shotgun can stun the monster temporarily and allow you to escape.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, this game is really unfinished but I figured I'd still submit what I had to the jam. Might remake it later down the line, so stay tuned for that :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f56961f7ad6bf7b5717bba41f50ac6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlickRamen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
