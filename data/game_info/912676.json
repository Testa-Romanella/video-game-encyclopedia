The speed dating event is almost over, and there are only 3 participants left. There isn\u2019t a lot of time left, and the host wants to close up for the night. You are going to have to get to know these participants in 10 seconds before making your choice.

These were two separate games, made in two separate weeks. Extreme Speed Dating was made in the 1st\u00a0week of the course, following the theme \u201810 Seconds or Less\u2019, whereas Extreme Speed Dating: AfterStory was made in the 10th\u00a0week, following the theme \u2018Sequel\u2019.\r\n </p>\n<p>In Extreme Speed Dating, players are tasked with going on 3, 10 second dates, and then picking an option at the end of the dates. A very simple idea, but I was very happy with how it turned out. I really wanted to explore these characters more, so when I got to make Extreme Speed Dating: AfterStory, I wanted to flesh out these characters, while also making a contrast between the first game and this one. Players are forced to take their time and wait in AfterStory, compared to rushing through in Extreme Speed Dating.\r\n </p>\n<p>All the artwork seen in game is made by myself.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba635ee068c1f98a5de37ce65cbb75f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holzycookie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
