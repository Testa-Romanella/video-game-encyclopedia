Humanity has discovered a new method for quick space travel. The player assumes the role of the pilot on the latest prototype vessel. A series of recent incidents code-named \"Anomalies\" have been recorded throughout the solar system. The player must visit each location of these anomalies, at varying locations.</p>\n<p>During the trip, the player must manage the ship\u2019s fuel and sleep, be aware of cosmic radiation, mechanical failures, and damage to the ship's hull. The micro-management of these features will constitute important part of the game, encompassed by an overarching story with several plot-twists. </p>\n<p>The second most important part of a game will be solving puzzles and fighting enemies.</p>\n<p>In some respects the game is similar to Elite Dangerous (mainly due to the appearance of the cockpit of the ship), but offers an interesting role-playing mission and many more activities to do. </p>\n<p>This version of the game has very limited functionality, customized for testing purposes.</p>\n<p>Please provide feedback here: https://www.reddit.com/r/LonelyAdventure/\r\n</p>\n<p>For more info about final game please visit\u00a0http://lonelyadventure.com \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d4/5d417a4c9ce2c4d414b2310df8f1585f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ingraw"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
