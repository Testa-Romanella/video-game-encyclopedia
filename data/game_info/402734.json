Currently it is just a tutorial level for testing and feedback purposes and will be expanded into the full game as development continues. If you understand this, then please play and give us some feedback. Thanks for your support.</em></p>\n<p><em>Corrupted Boundary</em> is a third-person beat'em'up/hack\u2019n\u2019slash that finds a player trapped inside a full-dive virtual world called the Boundary. The Boundary is being corrupted and the many game worlds it contains are being transformed into digital abominations. To unplug, the player will have to fight their way to the source of the corruption and discover a way to reverse it.</p>\r\nFull Game Outline\r\n<p><em><strong>This is what we are aiming for when this game is finished. (Features and content may change)</strong></em></p>\n<p>The player becomes someone who is trapped within the Boundary whilst playing one of the myriad games available there. The Boundary is a full-dive VR(Virtual Reality) gaming nexus available to everyone in the near future, the player will gain access to new game worlds as the story progresses. With each game world comes new equipable parts and abilities to customise their character, becoming stronger and more powerful to fight against Corruption and other threats.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <strong>Everything the player collects can be used in any of the game worlds.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Corruption causes normal game data to become corrupted, distorting and eventually overriding NPCs and whole worlds completely. Distortions are digital horrors which do not play by the rules of their programming or original game world and spread corruption wherever they go. The player must reverse the spread of Corruption, delete the Distorted and restart the Boundary so they can finally unplug and return to the real world.</p>\n<ul><li>Collect parts and abilities from each world and use them anywhere in the Boundary.</li><li>Explore an open-world virtual reality nexus where the Boundary between game worlds has been corrupted.</li><li>Use your parts and abilities to build your custom loadout and fight against the Corruption!</li><li>Experience eye-catching visuals and an epic, dynamic soundtrack in multiple virtual worlds brought to life with Unreal Engine 4!</li></ul>\n\r\nControl Scheme\r\nKeyboard/Mouse\r\n<ul><li>Move the\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0to control the camera.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Press<strong>\u00a0Left Mouse Button</strong>\u00a0to do a light attack.</li><li>Press the <strong>Q</strong><strong>\u00a0key</strong>\u00a0to do a special attack.</li><li>Press\u00a0<strong>Caps Lock</strong>\u00a0to lock onto the closest enemy.</li><li>Press\u00a0<strong>Tab</strong>\u00a0to switch to the next closest enemy.</li><li>Press<strong>\u00a0Spacebar</strong>\u00a0to jump.</li><li>Press\u00a0<strong>Left Shift</strong>\u00a0to dash/dodge in any direction.
