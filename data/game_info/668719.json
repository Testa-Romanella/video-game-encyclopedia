I made the sprite sheet myself using Gimp\u00a0and coded a new behavior so that the enemy move to specific position. It wakes up when you fire at it, and speed up as it takes damage (30 of health). I used the particle system for the snores and recorded the explosion sound effect using garage band (and my mouth XD ).</li><li>I also remade the menu completely to try the textmesh pro text with a simple gradient. I also use a dropdown to launch levels from the selection.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Created by Simon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba44b8e3603181f7771304bfcdeb428e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dutsi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
