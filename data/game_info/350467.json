Here you are:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA young succubus who despises all types of violence, trickery, and deceit, adventures off in search of an ancient artifact. An artifact, that will allow her to live on without the need for lust, without the need to trick, drain, and kill humans to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpon coming close to her goal, she collapsed due to overexertion and starvation. The poor succubus then began to fade away, until, she was discovered by a human. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis, is where the beginning of the story partakes.
