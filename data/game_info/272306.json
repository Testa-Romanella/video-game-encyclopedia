While still in very early stages, it gives a glimpse of things to come, and introduces you to the world. The game currently progresses along a general storyline with some randomly generated elements. There is an asynchronous online battle system so you can fight against other players. Explore as much of the world that is available to you, there are some secrets hidden about that may make things easier if you're having a tough time!</p>\n<p>While it is only a prototype created in 1 month and I have a laundry list of things to add and improve, please leave any comments you have about the game, positive or negative! I'd love to hear feedback, as well as any ideas for improvements people may have. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1de6dd88a732d266eb019fd9e4a9e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LockeCole88"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
