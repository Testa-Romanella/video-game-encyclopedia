Experiment! Try things out! Also, don't forget that each and every item has about 6 randomized quotes each, so remember that it doesn't hurt to try things multiple times!</p><p>Objects are randomized from a pool, so remember that what the screenshots show do not reflect the sheer amount of items added in.</p><p>Escape will immediately kick you out of the game, so be careful please.</p><p>This game was completed in under 12 hours as a part of the remake challenge we established the day before while looking back at some of my old/terrible games.</p><p>We wanted to try and evoke something like the original game, Hungry Boy but also add some more effects, polish and detail to it. Hopefully, you'll enjoy this little experience!</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>Yung Venus (Y.V) is owned by Vlambeer.
