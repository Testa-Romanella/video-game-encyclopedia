It's a sandbox game with no objectives other than to build your world and settlement, experimenting with resources to do so.</p>\n<p>There's some things I planned that didn't make it into the game. Such as citizens that travel the roads help boost your production. Achievements and help are also missing in the jam version, though I do plan on adding these in later.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to select tiles and items and place them into the world. Use WASD to scroll around the world. You can save items to use later by placing them into your inventory at the bottom of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c1e779af0c9451ec50599facdda2c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JackOatley", "Isaac S.
