As well as progressing the story at your own pace, you will discover different races, acquire better equipment and meet new characters.<br />\nYou are free to move within the area and choose your destinations: it&#39;s up to you to decide whether to go to the nearest city or to look around in the current location, to complete some quests (and which ones) or to test your strength in a difficult dungeon. After completing all the plot-related quests, you leave the area to the next and never come back.<br />\nUnique residents with rich history inhabit each area you visit.

Of course, when the stakes are this high, conflict is unavoidable, so prepare for battle by choosing the right tools for the job - find, trade for, or craft a wide range of equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable.<br />\nCombat system<br />\nWe spent a lot of time and effort developing our unique approach to battles and making them as interesting and exciting as possible. Any unexpected turn of events can get you into a fight. The world is also inhabited by a lot of hostile creatures that you will have to defeat in the course of events.<br />\nAt the start, you will have to pick a squad from your character&#39;s team including up to 4 members. The battle takes place on a stage consisting of two opposite fields, where characters and enemies are located on their respective sides. Characters move and act in a specific order according to their initiative.<br />\nWe developed a unique scenario for each battle. Each new enemy has their own features diversifying the fights and making you experiment and seek new approaches to succeed in the combat encounters. Naturally, each new battle requires more skill than the previous one.<br />\nWe have not forgotten about the tactical battles lovers. Some locations in Grimshade include special missions - hostile dungeons of a higher level of complexity. Here, every encounter with the boss turns into a mortal game of wits. Think over your strategy and prepare a squad that will be able to go through the dungeon in one go. In the end, you&#39;ll get a well-deserved reward!<br />\nHeroes<br />\nAlthough Grimshade is a single-player game, you won&#39;t be traveling alone. Advancing through the story, you&#39;ll get acquainted with seven heroes. Their personalities, focus, and backgrounds are pre-set, but you can control their skills and develop the relationship between the party members.<br />\nWe hope to add another hero soon after reaching one of the goals, and the script of the game suggests twelve of them.<br />\nStory<br />\nAfter the Great Flood, being torn apart by the heirs of Amon Darvish the Great and long-running civil war, the Kingdom of Easeon split into three states. Ree&#39;Fah witnessed the dark age for both livs and eleores. Nevertheless, after years of wandering, each group of people still managed to find a haven from the dreadful lands of the Hardfore continent, inhabited by monsters. Amazing technologies, the legacy of ancestors, secret knowledge of the world&#39;s nature, great and splendid objectives of the future were lost forever during battles for survival and hard work on settling the new society on the ruins of ancient cities, hostile wastelands, and dangerous mountain highlands.<br />\nEighty years have passed. When old wounds almost healed and people just embarked on the road to prosperity, new enemy forces gained the power to enter the scene, threatening the fragile stability of every living creature&#39;s life in the world.<br />\nArt<br />\nDuring one and a half years of development, the visual component of Grimshade has changed a lot. From a stylized watercolor environment with 2D characters, we moved on to adding 3D models of characters to the 2D world, creating our own shader, and a detailed environment.<br />\nOur artists drew the whole game by hand and carefully put it together, that&#39;s why the world of Ree&#39;Fah is full of life even in the most secluded corners. Hope you can feel this!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T14:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2cdf0b0ebb32ab0b1e3892ec579873a.jpg", "website": "http://grimshade.co.uk/", "rating": 2.89, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 43, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 559, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["TALEROCK"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Asterion Games", "UTC ASTERION"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
