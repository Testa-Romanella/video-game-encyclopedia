It features <strong>24</strong> seconds of soundtrack. Furthermore it features an incredibly impulsive computer player which only relies on the <em>rand()</em> function for thinking. It was made in one week (and one day) for a challenge. As if that was not enough there are <strong>hundreds</strong> of nearly identical players too choose from.</p>\n<p><strong>Known problems</strong><br/>It does sometimes crash when one player kills the other. On the windows version of the game sounds do not seem to work properly.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tested hardware</strong><br/>It has been tested on a 64 bit windows system and a mac running osx yosemite.<br/></p>\n<p>It is best enjoyed with a friend, enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6903ac71b5b19f24a50f5447a651e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["poffe22"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
