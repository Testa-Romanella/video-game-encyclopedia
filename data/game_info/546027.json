{"id": 546027, "slug": "the-dead-awakens", "name": "THE DEAD AWAKENS", "name_original": "THE DEAD AWAKENS", "description": "<p><em>The Dead Awakens</em> is an interactive story experience created on Twine. Following the selected character of your choice, players can navigate through the immersive narrative set during the post-apocalyptic world, after an airborne virus has infected people, turning them into undead husks. Players must fight the undead, scavenge for resources and begin to rebuild society in order to survive the nightmarish world. But, the surviving remains of society may be humanity's last hope, for some are immune.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong>\u00a0 Read the text on each page. If a video is available, you can press play to watch it, but it is not necessary for the experience. \u00a0To proceed to a new page, press the blue text - these are sometimes multiple options on the page, so you will have to choose the one you want for your story. You can click the return arrow on the left-hand side of the screen if you want to undo a choice.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> Play in landscape format on mobile and tablet - physically orientate your screen to do this. Also, optimise the experience by enlarging the screen if you are playing on a laptop or PC - this should be available at the bottom right corner of the screen.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://chazzsv123.wixsite.com/thedeadawakens\u00a0- VISIT THE WEBSITE!<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/thedeadawakens\u00a0- FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK<br/></p>\n\n<p>Please provide any feedback or queries in the comment section!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c1be6c3b6e0bb8d6b9ff30bb3803984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Charlie Vickers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
