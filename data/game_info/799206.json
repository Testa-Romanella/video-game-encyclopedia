The game is 50 MB (if that bothers you or you would like to know) and has two distributions. Windows, and PC (Windows, Mac, Linux). Please download the files accordingly!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Realm Bender</strong> is a short Visual Novel consisting of around 3 characters. Aaron, Matt, and Natalie. You wake up in a place you're unfamiliar with after attempting to shift the world around you. Aaron approaches you and soon enough you get along. He helps you on your quest to go back home to Earth. In the end...you find out something you may not have wanted to..</p>\n<p>The art style is very poorly made on purpose, but it gets a little better as you play. This started out as a small joke-y project I did that had a twist, but I ended up liking the idea. This game, however, will never be something entirely serious in my history. I just did this to test out Ren'Py, and satisfy my want to make a game that I've had all these years. However, I appreciate it if you enjoy the game!\u00a0:D</p>\n<p>There will be no donations available for a long time, or perhaps never. That also includes socials. This is a solo project that was experimental and I do not plan on taking it to a professional level, I don't really wanna take any of my work to that sort of level. I doubt this will gain that much traction anywho, so it doesn't really matter. Again, just a fun thing I made.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0<em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . .\u00a0</em></em></strong></em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0<em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . .\u00a0</em></em></strong></em></strong></p>\n<p>Today! You can play it right now, but it's not polished and it doesn't have music or good backgrounds. Again, this was my first project, and very experimental. I didn't like how the game was going either, which is why it's so fast paced and poorly structured.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0<em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . .\u00a0</em></em></strong></em></strong></p>\n<p><em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00a0</em><strong>Credits\u00a0</strong><em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0<em>. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . . . . . .\u00a0. . . . . .\u00a0</em></em></strong></em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thank you to my siblings for play testing and encouraging me to finish the game. Your kind words helped a lot :)</p>\n<p>Thank you to the tutorials on YouTube and the Ren'Py Documentation. As of now I have not put much of the tutorials to use besides the one premade in Ren'Py, but I'm sure later on I'll use some. So, thank you!</p>\n<p>And lastly, thank YOU for reading! If you're seeing this in the future and have played the game, thank you for playing!
