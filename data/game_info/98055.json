Most of the stuff is randomly generated or affected by RNG (random number generator) in some way. From not so unusual randomly generated rooms to quite extraordinary randomly generated items like weapons, spells and armor.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDungeon of Randomness has a lot to offer to those who like RPG games with four completely different classes (and more to come after Beta version), unique combat style, boss fights, character upgrades, passive and active abilities to help you in combat and many items like food, potions or even magical items. This game has also a lot to offer to those who like turn-based games and the thinking involved in them. In conclusion this game is no brainless enemy smasher, but while playing the game you'll find yourself making hard decisions that will effect your future character development and success of your mission to collect all of the boss keys.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHowever all of these upgrades, abilities and potions don't mean that the dungeons will be a walk in the park. Dungeons are hostile place full of monsters, deadly enemies and traps and you will be praying to find a village just to get a few moments to catch a breath.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Reminder:</strong> Currently Dungeon of Randomness is in <strong>Beta</strong> stage of development.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>NOTICE:</strong> The game is yet not optimized for all screen resolutions. Minimal recommended resolution is 1600x900, but preferred is 1920x1080.<br/>\r\n\tGame was also tested only on Windows and Java is required.</p><p><strong>Current version:</strong> Beta 1.0.02</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf860f6e59c9420cbd2c7c7540c87bd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixcom studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
