The game is composed of six left-to-right side-scrolling stages in which Riki faces different types of underlings (depending on the stage), facing the occasional sub-boss at midpoints of certain stages. Keeping true to the original source material Hokuto no Ken , underlings violently explode upon being punched or kicked. At the end of each stage, Riki must confront the stage&#39;s boss, each being susceptible to only one type of attack. The player must exploit their opponent&#39;s weakness and use it to finish the boss off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T11:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e05/e05ba58ff7b2cd3d7023c626c068fe1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Atari 5200"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
