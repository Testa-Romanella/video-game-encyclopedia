This was my first game jam, so it is largely incomplete. I was not able to get as much done as I had hoped, but the core concept is there. One grid of hexes with one color.</p>\n<p>Click on the white, empty hexes to place a colored dot within them. Create a connection between the hexes containing an X!</p>\n<p>Future additions may include more puzzles with more colors and bigger grids, background music, menus, and an editor to create your own levels.</p>\n<p>As part of OpenJam, participants were encouraged to use open source tools.\u00a0I used Godot and Aseprite in the making of this prototype.</p>\n<p>GitHub Repository:\u00a0https://github.com/AlexABallWebDev/xXconneXx</p>\n<p>License (also present in the repository):</p>\n<p>MIT License</p>\n\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br/>of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal<br/>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br/>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br/>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br/>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all<br/>copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
