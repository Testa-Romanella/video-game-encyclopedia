You started purchased small building and used your remaining funds to make it into a small\u00a0factory that develops robot parts. Your intent is to sell them off as potential collector's items, after all collector's love toys. And what better way to make it big than by taking a little and making a lot. That's right you have modular robot pieces! Your 9 pieces can create a total of 24 distinct robots.!<br/><br/>The problem, workers cost money so you have to put the robots together yourself. Make it big or fall deeper into debt? It's all up to you!<br/></p><p><strong>DEV TEAM</strong></p><p>Audio &amp; Art : Jose Munguia</p><p>Programming &amp; Art : Daniel \"Sekunri\" Urizar</p><p><strong>DEV NOTES</strong></p><p>Unfortunately due to circumstances we were not able to put as much time into this as we would have wanted. We had planned for more mini games, parts and even a shop. Heck there is a story planned but we didn't get to it.\u00a0It's obvious when you play it that this game is a bare bones concept of what we wanted but we hope you enjoy the little we have to offer and especially our soundtrack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8b/b8bded88b7f0d3df013412d64b75409d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sekunri"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
