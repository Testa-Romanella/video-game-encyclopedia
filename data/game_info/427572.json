For example if you get to build an hammock you might see Chico while taking some rest in your coffee time as soon as the screen saver starts ( or maybe not ).<br/><br/>The gameplay is very simple and intuitive because, as we\u2019ve already said, the game purpose is to give you the ability to customize your own screensaver and thus see how Chico enjoys himself doing exciting sports like throwing stones against condors and more; for the same reason we have also introduced a new sandbox mode.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Windows screensaver integration</li></ul><ul><li>In-game screensaver mode</li></ul><ul><li>AI ( just let the screensaver run and look at what happens )</li></ul><ul><li>Sandbox mode</li></ul><ul><li>Looting and crafting systems ( survival mode )</li></ul><ul><li>Day-night cycle</li></ul><ul><li>Customizable time speed ( time is set to your timezone )</li></ul><ul><li>Inventory manager</li></ul><br/><strong>Resources</strong><br/><ul><li>Wood</li></ul><ul><li>Stone</li></ul><ul><li>Water</li></ul><ul><li>Sandstone</li></ul><ul><li>Rope</li></ul><br/><strong>Useful tools and buildings</strong><br/><ul><li>Axe</li></ul><ul><li>Pickaxe</li></ul><ul><li>Shovel</li></ul><ul><li>Knife</li></ul><ul><li>Hammer</li></ul><ul><li>Workbench</li></ul><ul><li>Storage</li></ul><br/><strong>Free time ( used by Chico only when screensaver is running )</strong><br/><ul><li>Campfire</li></ul><ul><li>Hut</li></ul><ul><li>WC</li></ul><ul><li>Cauldron</li></ul><ul><li>Shave toilet...</li></ul><ul><li>\u2026..and much more</li></ul><br/>Our plan is to support the game with constant updates and thus releasing new tools and buildings to get Chico\u2019s free time more comfortable.<br/><br/>That\u2019s our idea, let us know what you think about it.<br/><br/>Greetings,<br/>1Monkey2Brains.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T06:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/78826950546eddf41561c86c2f807fb0.jpg", "website": "http://1monkey2brains.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1Monkey2Brains"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["1Monkey2Brains"], "esrb_rating": null}
