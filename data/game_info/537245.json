Solve simple puzzles and avoid dangerous obstacles using a simple touch UI. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS NOTE</strong><br/>This is a short mobile game (maybe 10-20 minutes) for Android that I built in my spare time. If you enjoyed it, please consider leaving a comment and/or sharing. Thanks you!</p><p><strong>Browser Bug</strong><br/>Also note that the \"Exit Game\" button does not work properly in the browser. On mobile it quits the application but it freezes the\u00a0 game if pressed in a browser. This shouldn't affect the game plat at all though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389c548a5b3247c1f7869403d4f109c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AntaresStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
