{"id": 242714, "slug": "palette-spectrum-of-shadows", "name": "Palette ~Spectrum of Shadows~", "name_original": "Palette ~Spectrum of Shadows~", "description": "<p>Hey there, this is my entry for the 2018 TyranoJam! :3</p>\n<p>Phia is a young woman who loves to read and her favourite tale by far is that of the heroic saviour of Tsukiria, Wren. When she is magically transported to the world of her beloved story, a realm plagued by the dreaded Gloom,\u00a0will Phia manage to learn how to live like the locals by suppressing her emotions in order to stay safe? Or will she fight against the darkness of the Gloom in an attempt to save Tsukiria and it's people from misery? The choice is yours in this short Jam entry with 3 possible endings! I hope that someone gets some enjoyment from this project :3</p>\n<p>It's not to a standard that I'm particularly happy with, but I didn't get that much time to work on this, still, I tried my best with the time I had, haha.</p>\n<p>I would like to think that my link to the Jam theme \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" is clear enough, but just in case it isn't, the story is about the effect an outsider can have in a foreign\u00a0 land. The way Phia chooses to act directly impacts the world around her and it's the players choice whether Phia \"does as the Romans do\" and attempts to blend in in her new environment, or decides to go against that and face the consequences.</p>\n<p>Side note: To anyone who is following me with interest in my other projects, I am so sorry for being silent for such a long time and for my severe lack of updates! I didn't intend to leave it so long to say this but I am still working on both Solipsism Reigns and Clarity in Qualia :3 I've just been very busy with personal stuff lately and so have lost track of time. I've not made that much progress as a result, but I definitely won't be giving up on those projects! I will try to post some form of log update sometime in October. I hope you understand and thank you so much for your support ^_^/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd7b6de5c2915de55f4edc5f9426409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IkariKali"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
