This early version is still very simple and may be improved on in the near future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>The only controls you have to worry about are clicking on the traffic light to make the train go or stop. Easy, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Objective: Pick up cargo at any of the four stations and deliver it to any other station. A station won't accept its own cargo back. Each successfully delivered crate is worth 25 points during the first four minutes of a round and 50 points during the last sixty seconds. Can you score over 1,000?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Future roadmap:</p>\n<ul><li>The game needs sound</li><li>Different camera views, both optional onboard camera and cutaways at the stations</li><li>Textured materials</li><li>Terrain features\u00a0</li><li>Additional levels</li><li>Revised controls, a slow reverse speed will be challenge enough</li><li>Mid-round events like extra valuable crates or orders for crates from specific stations</li><li>Mid-round train upgrades like additional cargo space</li><li>and more!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:30:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55a/55a26b2902b4e69b08977cfb7778cafc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Todd Mitchell"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
