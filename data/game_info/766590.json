{"id": 766590, "slug": "lava-tactics", "name": "Lava Tactics", "name_original": "Lava Tactics", "description": "<p>A submission for Ludum Dare 50 - \"Delay the Inevitable\" Jam event.</p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>In Lava Tactics, you take command of a team of firefighters who are attempting to belay the onslaught of an erupting volcano for as long as possible. The map will be populated with lava sources and animals. Your objective is to keep the animals from dying for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>When you click play you will be in the game configuration screen. Hover over buttons to learn more about them. Each team member needs to have 3 items equipped to be able to start the game. Please note that at this time the preview in the map generation screen is only an example, your map will not be identical.<br/></p>\n<p>In game, each firefighter (normally) gets 1 action per turn, whether that's moving or using an item. Once you end the turn, the lava and animals will simulate. Animals tend to run away from lava, but if they get caught in it, they will take damage and probably die.</p>\n<p>There are three UI windows in game: the terrain and lava height information for the hovered tile, the unit status for the selected tile, and the actions window. Use mouse 2 to pan the camera, mouse wheel to zoom, and spacebar to center the camera. Use left click to select tiles or units. Use tab to select the next available unit. Commit an action by clicking in a valid (highlighted green) tile with that action selected. Cancel an action by selecting it again or right clicking.</p>\n<p>There is no win condition for this game. Stave off the lava until it consumes everything, and enjoy your time with the wildlife. Experiment with the systems and try to last as long as you can!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>- Mouse1: Select button or tile</li><li>- Mouse2: Pan Camera</li><li>- Mouse Wheel: Zoom Camera</li><li>- 1-7: Toggle view options</li><li>- QWERAS: Select unit action</li><li>- Tab: Select next unit with available actions</li><li>- Space: Center Camera</li><li>- Enter: End Turn</li><li>- Escape: Pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T17:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/128064f4e9a399e347fff733a9ef3234.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Caius"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
