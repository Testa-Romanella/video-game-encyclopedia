I was particularly interested in the idea of having a map that you could explore and having more free-form controls than just pinball flippers. Unfortunately, the physics game framework that I was using--Phaser 3's Matter--was very temperamental. I ended up spending most of my time working around missing functionality in Phaser's tiled map support, working around bugs in Matter's handling of concave shapes, and working through a lot of under-documented interfacing APIs. As a result, I\u00a0was only able to make a very basic and minimal prototype of my ideas.</p>\n<p>Source code for the game is available on github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T07:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/673a8becd70c816be3dad3012f0f4f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["my2iu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
