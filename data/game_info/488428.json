It\u2019s a fast paced clicker with 5 levels, all with unique buttons (except \u00a0for the final level). It starts of easy but gets hard really quickly (I couldn\u2019t beat the final level).\u00a0All the programming, (bad) art and music made by me during the jam.\u00a0Originally, a collab with TudyPie. The game was made for the RageFest game jam but, I may expend on it later.\u00a0Had a lot of fun while making\u00a0it but, I ran into lots of problems in the development stage (I overscoped). Any Way, Loved this jam and I hope you will like my little project.
