You can have 3 cubes placed at once. These cubes disappear after 5 seconds, or if the robot hits them twice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:47:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/643a391089449b136f23a677090467c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geri3"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
