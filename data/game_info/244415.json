What happened to Martin? Curious and worried, Andre decided to find that hidden land and search for an answer.</p>\n<p>Martin's Legacy is a <strong>2D pixel-art</strong> <strong>adventure and puzzle</strong>\u00a0game focusing on <strong>a</strong> <strong>fantasy story</strong>. It was inspired when I went to see the film <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> last year. I wanted to create some fascinating creatures too, so here comes the game.</p>\r\nBackground Information\r\n<p>I developed the game in the first half of this year, with my roommate and other friends from different schools at Sichuan University. The team disbanded after we completed the first chapter of this game because other members got jobs. I want to continue my study and apply for a graduate program, so I still have some time to carry on developing this game. If you like it, then I'll try my best to create new chapters.</p>\n<p>If you get stuck in the puzzles or want the full walkthrough guide, check out the\u00a0wiki page of this game :-D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45bdf560bfa3d1f9cb5999d08c2223de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jingyi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
