To survive, you'll have to prepare during the day for the cold night and the days to come.\u00a0There's limited resources, but you should be able to last until rescue arrives.</p>\n<p>Make sure you start a fire for warmth everyday, and catch some food too. If you go to sleep hungry you'll be tired the next day. Every day that goes by wears you down, it'll be harder and harder to survive.</p>\n<p>Collect rocks and fill up the S.O.S sign so the rescue crew can find you!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move. <strong>E</strong> to ignite a fire, and to place rocks. <strong>R</strong> to lay down a crab trap.</p>\n<p>Use up your energy to end the day. Ending the day without fire will damage you. Ending the day without food will deplete your energy. Eating food raw (not having a fire) will damage you, but won't reduce your energy as much. Running out of health or energy ends the game. Finish the S.O.S sign to win.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This project was made for the Ludum Dare 47 compo. All code, art, audio, etc were made by me during the jam. Unfortunately a game breaking bug delayed my submission, so this will be submitted to the jam rather than the compo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e285d8c46f6a3873f4d4a6bb7a187a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["versooo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
