But don't forget to gather some gold and allies on your way down.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>- Arrow keys or WASD to move.</p>\n<p>There are also four different AI protocols to select from for your allies using the on-screen buttons:<br/>- <em>Follow</em>: your allies will attempt to follow you. Those that cannot currently see you will look for you in the last location they saw you at.<br/>- <em>Assault</em>: your allies will attack any enemies on sight.<br/>- <em>Mine</em>: your allies will mine and collect gold from nearby veins that they have located.<br/>- <em>Escape</em>: your allies will try to make their way to the stairs leading further down, provided that they have seen them.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><em>If you liked the concept of this game but wished it didn't slow down so soon and was overall less buggy, keep an eye on this space. I intend to release an updated version with bug fixes and general improvements once the Ludum Dare rating period ends.</em><br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Powered by the DragonRuby Game Toolkit.
