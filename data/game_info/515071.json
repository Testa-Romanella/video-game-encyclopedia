A range indicator shows what this range is. A bar on the top left of the screen shows the current self-control.<br/>- At 80-1 self-control, 2B starts losing control of movement and twitches around randomly.<br/>- At 0 self-control, 2B can't be controlled anymore.<br/>- The characters can move with the left and right sticks of almost any controller. (2B with left, 9S with right)<br/>- The characters can interact with interactable objects with the left and right trigger. (left trigger 2B, right trigger 9S)<br/>- When interacting with something that includes text, a textbox will pop up. Pressing the interaction button again proceeds the interaction.<br/>- The player can make a choice, which has different consequences.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0!!NieR:\u00a0AUTOMATA SPOILERS!!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>2B is still infected with the virus that took her over in the main game and with a lack of technology in this new world, only 9S can keep her under control.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>NieR: Automata Story Summary:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>!!END OF\u00a0NieR:\u00a0AUTOMATA\u00a0SPOILERS!!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUG(S)</strong><br/>* The Self-Control bar does not hide when the game is finished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:32:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e68ad32c9fd781c5ea2b7fac20fe172c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["universo5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
