The number of cells vertically and their number horizontally are equal. So the block is a square (the cell is also a square). Each cell might be filled (blue color means a cell is filled with water) or be empty (grey color).The player's goal is to rotate the blocks clockwise to ensure it is possible to traverse the board from any filled cell in the first row (top row of board cells) to any filled cell in the last (bottom) row through the filled cells of the board in a given time (1.5 minutes). The path can not pass through the cells located diagonally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25c5f475556810d8de7927f53ae7e3ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seepcell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
