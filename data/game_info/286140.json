The possibilities of what we can do are limitless, as well as where we do them. Alternate universes can be similar to ours, or very, very different, or even both. Instead of having a meal at home, an alternate version of you could be having that same meal at an upscale restaurant. Instead of sitting in on a lecture at school, your alternate counterpart may be attending the same lecture in the middle of a raging volcano as if it were a normal thing to do. Similarly, two spaceships from parallel dimensions can have similar routines, but different contexts. One uses its array of weaponry to blast alien foes, while the other uses those same weapons to mine and navigate asteroids to collect resources. Although the two ships are part of different lives, their destinies, their\u00a0<em>twin fates</em>, are one and the same.</p>\n<p>Credits, controls, and additional information can be found on my website:\u00a0Twin Fates at Byzarru</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30da6ef52029700c65b7946d443ac4eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Byzarru"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
