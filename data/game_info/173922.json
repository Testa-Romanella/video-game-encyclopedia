Choose from between 3 species each with a unique ability and distinct traits to fill a different ecological niche. Try to survive as long as possible and produce as many offspring as you can.</p>\n<p>The theme for this Game Jam was to create a 2-button game. Your creature constantly moves forward in the game, and you can use [A] or [D] to turn left or right respectively. Pressing [A] + [D] together activates your unique ability. The same controls are used to navigate menus.</p>\n\n<p>Current Version: 1.0.2</p>\n<p>Release: 13.11.2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/0650cbaa27f00b5bd7233d0c0cd76cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Alioth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
