It is a very simple top-down shooter.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD / Arrow Keys</strong> to move around, <strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> to shoot.</p>\n<p>Regular bandits are worth 1 point, dashers are worth 2 and knights are worth 3.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game, made entirely in Godot in the span of a few weeks. It has no sound effects, and very little replaybility. It's more of a test than anything, really, but I'm still posting it as some of my friends were curious about it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:42:54", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anomalous Chicken"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
