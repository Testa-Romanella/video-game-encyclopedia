{"id": 376863, "slug": "lc-alredmarkliatro", "name": "LC (AlredMarkLiatro)", "name_original": "LC (AlredMarkLiatro)", "description": "[ENG_VER]\r\nLC tells the story of its multi-level and serene universe.\r\n\r\nYou will be immersed in the study of the world, because there are no planets and stars familiar to us, and objects do not consist of atoms at all, but of pieces of code. The main task in the game, however predictable, is the salvation of the whole world. However, the game does not predispose you to follow the script. Your actions are not limited, and if you want to continue the actions of the script, you just have to go back to the place where the story began, or use the function in game options. The project universe is divided into clusters consisting of one root mega-cluster. Their location structure is somewhat reminiscent of the location of objects in the galaxy, and therefore, the closer you are to the center of the mega cluster, the denser the clusters that contain other vast worlds. The clusters themselves are very different from each other not only by the type of graphics, but also by other elements. You have to explore LC, and prevent decay fabric of reality.\r\n<p>Attention!<br/><br/>Game in early access [alpha] state (raw).\u00a0\u00a0For now, there's small amount of playable locations.
