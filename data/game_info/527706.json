Finding yourself in a odd house, your goal is to escape the house so you can return to your friends.</p>\n\n<p>This was the idea a couple a friends and I came up with\u00a0for the Yogscast 48 hour game jam for December 2020. Yet again this year,\u00a0I worked on the project alone. The gameplay might be a little lacking, there aren't any sound effects or real animations, but I think I achieved a lot more this year than the previous year.\u00a0 Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>(I also couldn't really come up with a good name, sorry about that).<br/></p>\n<p>[Made with Unity]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde5937dac1bea62eb8492f4233c19e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Wouda"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
