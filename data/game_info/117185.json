You're welcome to check out the first attempt at bugfixing my jam code, or it in its original jammed unadulterated form. The OpenGL one was technically compiled after the seven days, but with (from memory) no code changes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0bf75097d7e85c71fc0c9a3abf39fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lachlan Kingsford"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
