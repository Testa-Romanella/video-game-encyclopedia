A split between them formed the world you are in now, the world where magic is a powerful\u2014and feared\u2014tool, where mages were chased off into a small city of Riante after their recent attempt to seize control over the continent by taking over the Sunken Court.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>But the mages shall prevail.

Born of a forced alliance, along with his mother's infamy, he has inherited the touch of the Fourth Sister: depraved magic that steals and grants life essence. That what makes him a vulturous healer has also earned him distasteful reputation. For whatever reason he is well-mannered, patient, few would even call him kind. Gale often says very little\u2014a habit of watching his every word at court and yet never being heard.\r\n</p>\r\nArthur van der Garde (m)\r\n<p>The margrave to the dukedom of Noyer, he is Gale's closest friend, and the only thing that has stopped it from turning him into a social pariah is his easy charm and, upon strict insistence of his father, rigorous mage hunter training. It is hardly possible to find a person willing to trust you less.\r\n</p>\r\nDarla Belrose (f)\r\n<p>A spirited and ambitious knight: no one else could be appointed to guard the scorned prince, let alone volunteer for such an assignment. As the oldest child, she is eager to restore the position of her house, so perhaps she sees the prince\u2019s journeys as the means to that end. Her cautious curiosity towards magic could be another reason...\r\n</p>\r\nYvette (f) / Yves (m) le Tellier\r\n<p>The current Gray Regent and the youngest child of Gideon le Tellier, whose earlier conquest on the city of Rimehall has earned him the title of Usurper. Now sitting at the top of the tower in Riante, they claim the high goal of mage restoration, but you cannot help but notice the way their jaw clenches whenever King Karon\u2019s name is brought up. That, and how often you seem to catch their gaze.\r\n</p>\r\nJax (nb)\r\n<p>Your handler and council. Although a mage themselves, their preferred trade is information and planning. Jax is seen by others as closed off and meticulous, though, you hear, they are the best one at the Gray Regent's disposal and easily have their ear. How you got the cream of the crop to assist you is anyone's guess, Jax certainly isn't willing to have such a conversation.\r\n</p>\r\nIanthe (f)\r\n<p>Not every mage is bound to the tower of Riante and some choose the remote corners of the continent to further their pursuits. Ianthe is one of such mages, and rather than appearing on your target list, she seeks you out herself. She claims to have interest in your magic and offers to solve the mystery that envelops it, but to do that she would need your cooperation and, going by the company you keep, secrecy, either of which you may not be as eager to provide. <br/></p>\r\nExtra content\r\n<p>Development blog<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T16:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a7a4e517e8d2e66cbabd5018bf85732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grayascendancy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
