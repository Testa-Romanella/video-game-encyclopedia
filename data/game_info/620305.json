You must use magnets to propel you off platforms to simulate jumps. Aim to traverse the environment using magnetic forces to repulse off and attract to variously charged iron platforms.</p>\n<p>Game Jam Theme: <em>Joined Together<br/></em><br/></p>\n<p>My Interpretation:</p>\n<p>Using magnets as inspiration, I decided to design the entire project around duality. 2 specific events must be performed to simulate an action.  For example:</p>\n<ul><li>You must aim in a specific direction and use the magnet key to move. </li><li>North and South poles must both be used to traverse the enviornment</li><li>Using magnets, you can Push away from or Pull towards platforms</li><li>Success is measured using Total Play Time and Death Count</li><li>and more..</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aafdf69106c5c93b79f6efb0f758b5c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jamjes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
