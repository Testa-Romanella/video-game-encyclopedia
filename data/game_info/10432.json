The groundbreaking physics of Virtual Sports transfers the energy from the player to the angular momentum and force on the ball with a precision to match the Vive's sub-millimeter controller input. Combined with the Vive's haptics and great audio, the illusion is stunning. For new players, we can adjust the ball response such that it still feels real, and the laws of physics are still observed, but the ball stays in play much more often. Even master players find Fun Mode enjoyable, with its longer, almost meditative rallies.<br/><br/>Free Range Games has a mission to bring great gameplay to multiplayer VR. Using networking techniques perfected for competitive action video games, the latency when playing Virtual Sports online is hidden from the player in such a way that both players will see the ball hit at the same time even if they are playing from far apart.<br/><br/>If you have have been waiting for a sports game in VR that is big on fun and truly realistic, then Virtual Sports is just what you\u2019ve been waiting for!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb9d47e7523316cf173d314024c6f29f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Free Range Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Vive Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
