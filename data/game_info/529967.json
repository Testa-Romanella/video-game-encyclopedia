Play as two school aged kids desperate to skip school and watch movies at the theater. Disguised with an old oversized coat with matching hat the kids first need to leave their house without being seen. Then they must dodge the prying eyes of adults as they make the long walk to the theater. This already wasn\u2019t an easy stroll, but it's about to get harder as you have no money and tickets cost $3. Luckily, there seem to be neglected coins strewn about the neighborhood. So collect enough money, stay out of sight, and reach the theater.\u00a0</p><p>To run the game open Top down movement Test.exe</p><p>Warning!</p><p>- In the first level if you enter battle feel free to check out each option but you will need to \"alt +f4\" and restart the game. This is a bug due to missing scripts.</p><p>- The ticket booth gate blocking the way to the movie theater that requires all 20 coins to pass is unavailable at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2aa/2aa706c85cae057f11c310fb762d5699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rpglink", "LogNog"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
