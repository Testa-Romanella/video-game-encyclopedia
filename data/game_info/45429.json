Defend it by night. Stay alive as long as you can.<br />\nYet Another Zombie Defense HD is all about defending yourself against hordes of darkness attacking you every night. However, when you&#39;re the only survivor struggling against waves of enemies who are getting stronger and stronger, your end is inevitable. The only important question is how long can YOU survive?<br />\nThe game is a top-down arcade zombie shooter with strategy elements. You&#39;re able to choose from variety of weapons to mount them onto auto turrets and set up defensive barricades to stay alive as long as you can. It&#39;s for gamers who like to put their skills to the test, find optimal strategy, and reach the highest spot on leaderboards! It also features both online and local co-op mode, where you can blast zombies with up to three friends as well as player vs player deathmatch mode!<br />\nWe have some great news who everyone who wanted more from Yet Another Zombie Defense. The upgraded version is coming to Steam in just two weeks and it&#39;s going to bring a lot of awesome improvements, including frequently requested Steam Workshop integration!<br />\nFirst of all, the HD version was entirely rebuilt with Unity3D engine, which is an awesome tool for indie developers and drastically decreases time needed to make any changes. The tech that the old version was build with called Microsoft XNA was abandoned by Microsoft in 2010 and it&#39;s been a burden to work with. This is why last year we&#39;ve decided to drop XNA and switch to Unity3D. It&#39;s been a lot of frustrating and painful work to port an entire game from one engine to another, but now it&#39;s clear it was well worth it - it looks much better now and we&#39;re able to add new features and content in no time.<br />\nThe use of Unity3D engine also allows us to integrate Steam Workshop, so hopefully we&#39;ll see some great stuff that the game&#39;s community will make! Other improvements already made are better rendering and physics, new zombie characters and animation, as well as the addition of new enemies trying to get you killed. And the fourth playable character, finally. There&#39;s also features like localization including non-English chat, cloud saves, non-Xbox controller support with full controls remapping, overall better stability and performance, as well as many other minor improvements.<br />\nAnother great news is that everyone who owns the base version will be granted a 75% off coupon at the game&#39;s launch, and will be able to cut its price from $3.99 to just $0.99! It&#39;s as low as we could get in order to justify the cost of porting to Unity3D, upgrading the content and keeping the game updated after launch. We really believe that you won&#39;t be disappointed by what you&#39;re going to get for the one buck!</p>", "metacritic": 46, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T16:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3fab0d941e730831407f5b816a26fdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 381, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 13, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 110, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Awesome Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awesome Games Studio", "Awesome Games", "Awesome Games Studio Sp"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
