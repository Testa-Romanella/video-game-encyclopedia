You can also find an awesome but heavily guarded power-up. The controlls are a bit untraditional, but you'll get used to them. You press the left and right arrow keys to rotate and the up and down ones to move forward and backward. I\u00a0appreciate all the support and it really helps, so keep playing our games and donate if you can!</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Broken Wire Dev</p>\n<p>If you want to donate, click the button below the game that says \"support this\u00a0game\".
