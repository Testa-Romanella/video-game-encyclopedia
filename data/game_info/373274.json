I chose to go a slightly obscure route, by building a game about the on-going destruction of our oceans from all the plastic and trash. I know, riveting. Play as a piece of trash floating through the ocean and avoid being eaten by fish. Complete with peppy music, poorly drawn sprites, and snarky comments.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!
