As a very small child I saw the arcade machine in a university cafeteria\u00a0and it set me on a life-long path of loving video games and, eventually, making them for a living. (That might or might not be a good thing in the long run, but either way I'm stuck with it now.) At any rate, I've made a tribute to one of the greatest games ever made. Please enjoy <em>Cruise Elroy</em>!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gameplay features:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay, AI, graphics, and sound shockingly similar to\u00a0the original arcade game.</li><li>21 different mazes to play through, including mazes based on spinoff games and bootlegs and four original stages.</li><li>Remix mode plays with randomized stages and fruit.</li><li>Timed modes challenge you to get as far as you can with unlimited lives.</li><li>Adjust difficulty levels and play as Ms. Pac-Man.</li><li>Is there a kill screen? Yes, of course there's a kill screen.</li><li>Create your own stages easily by\u00a0modding the game's files.</li></ul>\n<p>It's a good time. You should try it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fea/feae311605c868aa4a3468440cf4fb22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mayfly Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
