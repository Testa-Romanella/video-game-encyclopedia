I started messing with Unity seriously a couple weeks ago. After watching some videos on the game-jams, I\u00a0decided to challenge myself to actually make a full game this weekend. Instead of \"putzing\" around trying to build things that are beyond my current abilities. So here it is. I would love to hear feedback on this.\u00a0And now, on to the game.<br/><br/>In the Style of \"Where's Waldo\" you are assigned a target to find in the crowd,, and\u00a0\u00a0shoot them.\u00a0Why?\u00a0 Who cares. <br/><br/>You start with 30 seconds. Every \"assigned\" target you kill, gives you an additional 5 seconds. Every person you shoot that isn't your target has a penalty of 5 seconds. Meaning, you lose 5 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The more targets you kill the harder it gets. Can you make it to the end?\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>This was a hoot to make, and my brother threw down with trying his hand at pixel art. (He did a great job!)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>Fire: Left Mouse or Left Conrtrol<br/></p>\n<p>Menu:\u00a0Esc or M</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:54:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/00377a2d9b9e710ac1668d3ac66684dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["fcarentz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
