The mines are stagnant initially but as soon as something collides with them they get triggered and a count down starts. When the count down reaches 0 they explode and damage everything around them.</p>\n<p>You can also find different types of mines hiding in the yellow blocks.</p>\n<p>I have only used the default graphics you get with Unity (Square, Circle, Hexagon), used photoshop for the banner and icon.</p>\n<p>I generated the music with Store and fine-tuned it with Adobe Audition.</p>\n<p>For SFX, i have used some base sounds from my previous games and \"remade\" them using Adobe Audition to match this game.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think and be honest :)</p>\n<p>Follow me on:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/appoxgames</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/</p>\n<p>And if you are interested, check out my published solo developed mobile game:</p>\n<p>https://www.fishroyale.io/</p>\n<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appox.fish&amp;hl=en_US</p>\n<p>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fish-royale-ocean-adventure/id1504305327<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:45:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3d/f3d0f313ea1a37d422d9f11693f1848d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Appox"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
