The theme was <em>Versatile Verbs</em>, so, in that spirit, <strong>AL</strong> (the player character) can usually do multiple things with only a few controls. This is an open source game. The repository can be found here if interested.<br/></p>\n<p>While <strong>AL</strong> has \"life\" and a \"score\" value, I did not have time to display them on the screen. <strong>AL </strong>will die if taking too much damage.</p>\n<p>The game works with both keyboard and gamepad (I tested on a PS4 controller, but an XBox One controller should work just as well)</p>\n<p>Couple small hints that didn't make it into game...</p>\n<ul><li>Double tapping left or right will cause <strong>AL</strong> to dash. While dashing, <strong>AL</strong> is invincible and not effected by gravity</li><li><strong>AL</strong> can jump a little higher if jumping from crouch.</li><li>Look for blocks with a very subtle pulsing effect. If <strong>AL </strong>dashes into them while in Ball form (holding down crouch), <strong>AL</strong> can break them, revealing secret areas.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This prototype was created using the Godot 3.0.2 engine over one weeks time. All code and graphics are made by me. All music and sound effects were obtained from creative common sources. Please check the <strong><em>CREDITS</em></strong> file for attributions!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Camera offset has been significantly reduced.</p><p><strong>POST JAM UPDATE: </strong>Released a version 1.01 which fixes a small bug with trying to morph from ball to AL while on spikes. <em>ALSO</em>, adjusted (down) the delay time between directional button presses needed to initiate a dash... seeing as a few people had issues with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec992cfe0d3c2bdb8373183ac8539e40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
