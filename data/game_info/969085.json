Testing, testing.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cMy sensors really need a clean!\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cOh wait, there you are.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWelcome test subject to our human radiation colour ...or is that color? Hmm I\u2019m not sure, my programming has more than a hint of the transatlantic in it\u2026Where was I\u2026 Oh yes.,, Welcome test subject to our human radiation colour perception challenge. My name is Finley 808 and I'm your AI companion for your short foreseeable future.\u201d<br/><br/><strong>Pit your wits against the maniacal artificial intelligence Finley in this reimagining of the unknown and very secret 1960\u2019s human perception tests carried out in top secret hidden bunker laboratories.</strong><br/><br/>\u201cDid you know there\u2019s a Prize to be found deep in the Laboratory at the end of this test?\u201d<br/><br/><strong>As the test subject, the deeper you go into the facility, the harder the puzzles become to most. </strong><br/><br/>\u201cThanks to a lucky find near Roswell, New Mexico we have built this facility to experiment on some new forms of matter\u201d<br/><br/><strong>The objective of each test is simple. Drag and drop the available laser manipulation devices to split, redirect and absorb the laser death ray and eliminate the alien blob like waste product artefacts.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cThe death ray\u2026 I mean focused radiation beam\u2026 is quite powerful. Should it touch the sides I will have no choice but to activate sterilisation protocols!\u201d<br/><br/><strong>It is possible for the light beam to touch the sides of the test laboratory. If you do, it will activate a countdown (limiting the time you have to pass the test). Should the countdown reach zero (all containment suppression fuses in the lab are blown), you will fail the test. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cOh I do hope you aren\u2019t one of the mediocre ones. You know your colours right? Oh I do hope so, whilst this alien waste product is messy, recycling substandard humans is really messy!\u201d<br/><br/><strong>The alien artefacts have a distinct hue. Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and White. The white light of the laser will neutralise any of these. However you can split the white light (and combine of course) into these colours to remove corresponding Alien waste products. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m always amazed just how many supposedly bright humans don\u2019t understand how primary colours are mixed to make other colours. As a species you boast about the likes of Newton and Einstein, but really. The number of test subjects I see that didn\u2019t know Red and Green makes Yellow, Red and Blue makes Magenta and, get this, Blue and Green makes Cyan. I mean please, over 80 billion neurons and not one helping\u2026 I will understand this species one day\u201d.<br/><br/><strong>A report card is produced for each test level completed. The grading is typical of the 1960\u2019s where a \u201cF\u201d is an out and out fail through to an A (a top pass). Finley will award three star ticks for the best \u201cA\u201d class students! You are welcome to retake a level test again and again to improve your rating and score.</strong><br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s good to reward good effort don\u2019t you think?\u201d <br/><br/><strong>You can increase your score (and report card attainment of course) by completing levels quickly, matching laser beam colour to Alien blob and minimising the number of device moves.  </strong><br/><br/>\u201cOh dear, that was a failure. Where will I get the next test subject from?\u201d <br/><br/><strong>Do share your report with friends. Perhaps they will be better or worse than you when they face Finley\u2019s Colour of Radiation challenge? Either way, it\u2019s a game that will improve your cognitive and problem solving skills - Those secret 1960\u2019s experiments have to have proved something right?</strong><br/><br/>\u201cWe like humans, they will do whatever you ask of them, if you ask in the right way. Only last week I said to a test subject that managed to get to the Prize\u2026 I got into a fight with 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. \u2013 The odds were against me. Soon after, 19 and 20 had a fight. Twenty one.         ....They laughed!\u201d<br/><br/><strong>Still not sure if you want to give this game a go? Well, we can offer you hearsay and hyperbole regarding the experience of this game. Here are some of the totally fictitious characters that helped develop it\u2026</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cMan. This game is far out. The colours dude, they like blend you know.\u201d (Comic reader guy, Long Beach, CA)<br/><br/>\u201cMy uncle did a lot of deep water filming in the 1960\u2019s, but this game takes you deeper.\u201d (Jake Coostoe, Monaco )<br/><br/>\u201cOne doesn\u2019t simply play the game, one becomes the game, doesn\u2019t one?\u201d (MP, London)<br/><br/>\u201cYou know\u2026 When I was stuck in the game, I did manage to get by with a little help from my friends.\u201d (Musician, Liverpool)<br/><br/>\u201cFloot-rig-noota-garf-garf-yipa-enata-solinty-bim.\u201d (A caretaker, Altair V)<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy this game! <br/><br/><strong>Duckocide Games</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T02:03:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b3cadee6a1a0fc5f03e730c445f6538.jpg", "website": "https://www.duckocide.games/finleys-the-colour-of-radiation", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Duckocide Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rednova Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
