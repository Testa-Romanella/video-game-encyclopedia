Reports of eyewitnesses were used, but some parts were shortened, changed or added to improve the consistency of the story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game tells you the story of a young mother and her child escaping from persecution by the soldiers with red flags, suddenly forcing her to leave her home. During her escape, you have to make difficult decisions, leading either to disaster and death or to survival and a new life far from home.</p>\n<p>At the end of storyline, you will find a connection between the past and the present, linking your experience to real historical events and places that are still visible today. By connecting the past to the present, we want to highlight that the challenges of migration and the consequences of discrimination and persecution are timeless.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to connect the historic content of the game to the timeless topic of escape and migration, with the story itself but also with the additional content of the game. We believe that by learning from the past and seeing how the same things still happen in the present, we can work on preventing them in the future!</p>\n<p>Co-published by Friedrich Naumann Foundation:</p>\n<p>The Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF) is a German foundation devoted to the promotion of liberal principles and to political education.
