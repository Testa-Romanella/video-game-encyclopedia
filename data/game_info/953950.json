Her favorite food is tofu hamburger.<br/><br/><br/><strong>\u201cIf Sis says you're her enemy... Then you're my enemy too.\u201d</strong><br/>One half of the Ni-no-Kami of the Eight Swords, also known as Raijin of the Thunder.<br/>Despite being the youngest of the Swords, she and her twin sister Akane are together the strongest fighting force in Kanto.<br/>Even wilder than her sister Akane, Aoi is a berserker who finds the most satisfaction in battle.<br/>She does pick up some of the thinking that Akane prefers to skip, but loves her older sister so dearly that she leaves the decisions to her.<br/>Luckily, Aoi also enjoys the chaos that inevitably ensues. She's such an adorable agent of violence.<br/><br/><br/><strong>\u201cI want to see where you are going. The places you will reach.\u201d</strong><br/>Just an ordinary person. She's no one in particular.<br/>Assigned to guard and look after Shin, her only power is exceptional physical strength, which doesn't go very far in battle.<br/>Her primary purpose as far as Kanto is concerned is to serve Shin as a representative sample of the culture.<br/>Her honesty and inflexibility also tend to make her the butt of jokes.<br/>At first, she can barely stand Shin, but in time she becomes his greatest confidant.<br/><br/><br/><strong>\u201cLet's eat ricey balls. I agree with the coming together of rice into a neat shape.\u201d</strong><br/>Haruhime's elder sister and the hero of Kanto, now believed to be deceased.<br/>She had the power to command the world itself with her words, creating matter from nothing as the ultimate user of the power known as Kotodama.<br/>One hundred days before Shin awoke, she struck down one of the Kurokami that served as the lynchpins of humanity's oppression, freeing her people\u2014and being struck down herself in the process.<br/>She has not been seen or heard from since.<br/>The near-godlike abilities that she wielded made her into something else, inhuman, without the urges or emotions that drive her lesser brethren.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T13:47:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb5ecdbb55cd807c9226d7e3129a3be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purple Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
