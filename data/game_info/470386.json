But\u00a0cubes can also\u00a0appear too far... So you need to shift your keyboard on left/right to access to them.\u00a0This game is short, a bit difficult at the beginning, but we think it's very funny to play,\r\nSo, we hope you enjoy it too, and try to\u00a0make the best score ! ;)</p>\n<p>Informations :</p>\n<p>Music/Graphism :\u00a0@LapinLambda</p>\n<p>Code : Me !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5e47402085bc0d98f6d94670f1ccb79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JieKou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
