Thanks for checking this prototype\u00a0out! The hope is that the game can expand to include more levels and more ways to\u00a0<strong>protect the blue rectangle</strong>. Consider this a version 0.1 for the time being, so this is a very bare bones version of what I plan for this game. Still, I hope you have some fun with this prototype and look forward to the future.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty early in my game development journey as I'm learning all that I can, but I still wanted to create something to show for all the things I've been learning.</p>\n<p>This is an ongoing project, so please look forward to what's coming next!</p>\n<p>-R</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d234f00bc5af733634bc730f31b2296f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Duckling Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
