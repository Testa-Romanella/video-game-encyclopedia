This is a game about waiting for the future to arrive.<br/><br/>music inspired by Foreigner \"Waiting For A Girl Like You.\"<br/><br/>I will probably add at least a proper intro screen. I might add a desert bus type scoring mechanic and make it kind of a tamagotchi thing, but again this is a game about waiting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905fb9badefc3ff69277d2d56e01f714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BunnzoSteel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
