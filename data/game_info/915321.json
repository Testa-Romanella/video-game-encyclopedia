{"id": 915321, "slug": "ii-2-genesis-of-the-dark-crystals", "name": "II-2: Genesis of the Dark Crystals", "name_original": "II-2: Genesis of the Dark Crystals", "description": "<p>In a world healing from its wounds and coping with its scars, a cancer begins insidiously brewing beneath the surface. The crystals, a source of limitless life and energy, which pulled humanity back from the brink of extinction, now threaten the same. In a quest that will take them to the four corners of the world and even beyond, a band of young heroes will be tested to their limits. Beyond hope, faith, and doubt, they must learn to trust in a force both unseen and greater than themselves, yet that also interpenetrates with them and every fiber of their being. Discover the fate of Nelly, daughter of Josef, and Kain, heir of the Dragoons, joined by Paul the thief, each with their own scenario that unfolds in a similar fashion to Final Fantasy VI - in any order the player wishes.</p>\n<p>Began as a project to help the creator learn RPG Maker MV, \"II-2\" evolved to include numerous references and plot points spanning the entire FF series. Set three years after the original, \"Genesis of the Dark Crystals\" serves as a lead-in to the rest of the series using the established world and characters of Final Fantasy II as a basis. Dungeon layouts, enemies, and music are borrowed from the first six games, in addition to emulation of FF2's skill mastery system, with select modifications and enhancements for improved playability. Later series gameplay systems are adapted as well, including blue magic, relics and magicite. </p>\n<p>Featuring more than 20 hours of gameplay and 12 playable characters, \"II-2: Genesis of the Dark Crystals\" begins with the selection of three scenarios, followed by an expansion of the world characterized by free-roaming, that ultimately culminates in a mirrored, cooperative effort to resolve the conflict (a la \"Soul of Rebirth\"). Highly replayable due to the open-ended nature of the character progression, the game seeks to realize what was set out to be accomplished by the original team. It serves as a window into the \"what-if\" scenario of FF2 being the foundation for the future of the series. It is a love letter to the original game, and FF as a whole, penned by someone who cherished it greatly and wished to see its full potential come to fruition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T08:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a60f8f859ce87a47703a4d3a39f63b81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SC_Nikki"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
