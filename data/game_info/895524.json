You play as a dinosaur (Tyrone the T-rex)\u00a0and you jump to try to collect items that come in from the right side of the screen. There are two kinds of items, coins and fruit. The coins just give you points while the fruit fills up the meter in the top right corner. When it is full, you can press Q and your dinosaur will suddenly have a cape and the ability to fly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T14:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e5768e6be8c1a94a72b0cef7ac5921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmilyTerra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
