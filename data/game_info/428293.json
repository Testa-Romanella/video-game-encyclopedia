The list goes on and on, and the faster you perform, the higher your awarded score.<br/><br/>At the end of each game, there is one final obstacle players must face - the boss stage, which is a slightly bigger game worth a lot more points. The perfect opportunity to flip the tides of war.<br/><br/>MicroWorks is fast without pause - microgames will keep coming at you consecutively as they become increasingly faster with each one. Keep up with the tempo and outrun your opponents to win!<h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li> Over <strong>50</strong> microgames, each with different variations - totalling in over <strong>200</strong> ways to be tested on the battlefield!<br/></li><li> At least <strong>15</strong> boss stages.<br/></li><li> Multiple gamemodes such as <strong>Scorematch</strong>, where players compete to get the highest score, or <strong>Survival</strong>, where failure means death, and the last player standing wins.<br/></li><li> Up to <strong>20</strong> players in a server, as well as the ability to play alone.<br/></li><li> <strong>Mutators</strong> allowing you to change almost every setting of your game, including microgame probability!
