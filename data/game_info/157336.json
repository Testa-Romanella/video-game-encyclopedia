It's the middle of a zombie outbreak and you need to leave. The only problem is that the key to the teleporter pad is hidden somewhere in the city. Can you dodge the zombies and make it of the city alive?<br/>*Three Modes: Story, Survival, and Zombie. Story lets you play through a story. Survival lets you challenge the game with the random location. And Zombie gives you the chance to play as a zombie and experience an RPG twist to the game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59d1bd840847ac526e483d4bd22b9c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Negative Zero"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
