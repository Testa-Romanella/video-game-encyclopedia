You can craft tools and other items and use them to shape the world freely!</p>\n<p>Don't forget about hunger and thirst! Prepare nutritious meals and drink water regularly (try not to drown in it too). Don't try to jump from heights either.</p>\n\n<p>It's an alpha version of the game.\u00a0I've been working on it since around May 2019. The game will be developed for some\u00a0more time (hopefully).</p>\n<p>The next steps in the development that I intend to do is:<br/>- saving game state option<br/>- independent creatures<br/>- plant cultivation (with dynamic growing)<br/>-\u00a0extensive dungeons with traps and treasures to find<br/>- weather effects<br/>- seasons<br/>- diverse biomes with unique fauna and flora.<br/>I'm thinking about\u00a0making a mobile version in the near future.<br/>In the far future, I consider adding a multiplayer option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I encourage you to follow the project! Fell free to comment.\u00a0I will be very grateful for all suggestions and ideas. </strong><strong>Thanks :)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>Download the .zip archive. You'll find there a\u00a0<em>Unity </em>build for Windows. Start the game with\u00a0<em>Blocky Miner.exe</em>.<br/>Type the world width and height (optional seed) and start. Do not\u00a0exceed values like\u00a04096x256 or\u00a02048x512 because the\u00a0whole world is generated on start and can take a while.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Control buttons</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Moving:</strong><br/>A - left<br/>D - right<br/>Space - jump</p>\n<p><strong>EQ interaction:</strong><br/>Right mouse on item - use it (if is usable)<br/>Buttons from 1-9 - use\u00a0corresponding item in bottom panel (if is usable)<br/>Left shift + right mouse on item\u00a0- alternate use of item (if has)<br/>Left shift + buttons 1-9 - alternate use of corresponding item in bottom panel (if has)<br/>Left mouse - move items between inventory/crafting slots<br/>Left shift + left mouse -\u00a0halve the\u00a0stack and move\u00a0items between inventory/crafting slots<br/></p>\n<p><strong>World interaction:</strong><br/>Right mouse on world -\u00a0set\u00a0 currently used item/block on position<br/>Left mouse on world -\u00a0destroy block\u00a0on position with currently used tool</p>\n<p><strong>Items to craft</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br/>Shovel, Hammer, Axe, Pickaxe, Knife<br/><strong>Wood derivatives:</strong><br/>Planks, Sticks<br/><strong>Metallurgy:<br/></strong>Iron, Gold, Silver<br/><strong>Eatable:<br/></strong>Health Potion, Soup<br/><strong>Other</strong>:<br/>Empty Bucket, Torch, Boat</p>\n<p>The exact crafting recipes and abilities of each item\u00a0will be published soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f6086f7cc44fe1dd5d27d7131e1aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DawidAntczak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
