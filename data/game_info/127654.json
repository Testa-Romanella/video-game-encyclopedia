Our goal was to deliver a short, but fun and replayable experience, then submit it to indie game development sites to learn from the actual game industry. Now by this point, you're probably like \"Yeah yeah, I don't care about your team's background story, I came here for video games dangit!\" So let me get to the best part of this being a student-created project:</p><p>SYNCH is completely FREE!</p><p>If you enjoy the game, we would certainly appreciate it if you would share it with your friends and leave us feedback! Thanks for downloading SYNCH, and we hope you have fun playing it!</p><p><strong>Developers:</strong></p><ul><li>Travis Forkner</li><li>Will Nations</li><li>Hailee Ammons</li></ul><p><strong>Artists:</strong></p><ul><li>Amy Li - Robots/Environment: Amy's Portfolio</li><li>Joseph Dufault - Concept art/Music</li><li>Kathlyn Ramsey - Concept art</li><li>Travis Forkner - UI/Robots</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab781a1f44787210ba97150e58215f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaylorGameStudio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
