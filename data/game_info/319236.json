{"id": 319236, "slug": "glitch-arena", "name": "Glitch Arena", "name_original": "Glitch Arena", "description": "Glitch, a fast and minimal arena first person shooter.<br/>Influenced by Quake and Unreal Tournament, Glitch is designed to encapsulate what makes AFPS great, and leave out what doesn't.     <br/><br/>Gamemodes include duel, DM, TDM and the new CTB (capture the balls, an evolution of CTF). <br/><br/>The focus is on gameplay and content instead of high fidelity details. Movement is non-linear, with an initial flick-dodge, step jumping (aka double jumping) and speed building via 'glitching'\u2122. Air control is medium-high and autojumping is a thing. Weapons are the \"holy trinity\" plus a pulse starting weapon, and the ability to combo a rocket with rail. Maps are iconic archetypes of the genre. Hitsounds and hitmarkers on the way. Learn the game with HUD item timers.<br/><br/>Glitch is designed by competitive gamers for constant good games between players of similar experience. So if you've got a friend or two you love to shoot, it's for you. You don't need a thousand concurrent players for a good time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c54008a9ce82db685f18a810fe409bd.jpg", "website": "http://shockandrockets.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shock & Rockets Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shock & Rockets Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
