Up to 4 players can compete (or co-operate!) in this short, low-stress, musical platformer. Play as a bass swingin' monkey or guitar swingin' panda, collect bananas, smack away your fans, and try to top the high score leaderboards!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li> Select your character and adjust strength, agility, and health stats to prepare for battle!<br/></li><li> Attack with elegant combos and dodge enemy attacks.<br/></li><li> Race to collect bananas, because they're tasty (and add to your point score)!<br/></li><li> Progress through an instrumental pop album. Each song brings its own new challenges!<br/></li><li> Play solo, compete against friends (4 players), or cooperate as a band to achieve the highest score you can!</li></ul><br/>A note from the developer:<br/>I hope that this little game offers you a <strong>short yet pleasant experience</strong>! It\u2019s good to play with friends/family, because it makes for a fun party game and an easy introduction into video games (it features infinite \"continues\"). Or, if you\u2019re playing alone and you have a decent pair of headphones/speakers, it can be a chill musical experience where you can try to max out your score on the leaderboards. Either way, I hope it brings you some joy -- I sure enjoyed making it!<br/>Cheers, Jacob Weersing (YakobSoup)<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T04:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb4fe87d1e175a2288f0607b60ae4a3.jpg", "website": "https://www.bassmonkeygame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Weersing"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jacob Weersing"], "esrb_rating": null}
