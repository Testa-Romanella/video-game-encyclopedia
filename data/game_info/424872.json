Tenuous Survival had something to it that made it superior to my other games. Replayability and frequent updates contributed to its success.</p>\n<p>Flimsy Living offers the same opportunity for players like you. I will frequently update and continuously improve this game until it becomes a better (not to mention 3D) experience. The download of Flimsy Living includes all the following:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Saving and loading</strong> your world. Just hold ESC during a game to return to the menu, but keep your game intact.</p>\n<p>-<strong>4 different enemies</strong> with updates prepared to add a bunch more with more diverse behavior.</p>\n<p>-<strong>6 different resources</strong> which you can sell at contract stations for money.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Contract and Upgrade system</strong><strong>s</strong> add complexity to the game without complication.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Easy to use UI</strong> which makes it easy to play the game without confusion.</p>\n<p>-<strong>A ton more</strong> is going to be added in future updates, as well as artistic improvements. If you have any questions or ideas for updates please comment here and on my sneak peek video on youtube (<strong>MequonMan2</strong> channel).</p>\n<p>-<strong>Quality Music</strong> created by Kevin Macleod.
