It has no music because I still don't know how to add some. Plus I can't make any lol.</p>\n<p>I feel like the story is all over the place. I actually didn't write one before doing the game and then went with whatever I felt. I really just wanted to have fun making something :D</p>\n<p>I'm really sorry if there are some writing errors but it's late and I'm kind of tired. I tried to correct every mistake I noticed.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope this game will be able to make you smile a little, even if sometimes it can be a lil\u00a0serious\u00a0:p</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0e/c0ea41737b198f225bdfd8792e84402d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jeffrey_well_tf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
