{"id": 781167, "slug": "raise-your-civilization", "name": "Raise Your Civilization", "name_original": "Raise Your Civilization", "description": "<p>                     Raise Your Civilization is going to offer unique  game-play, where you will be challenged with planning, constructing and  managing the whole civilization.                     Single settlement located on a vast map will be a  starting point of each game.                     Resource location and travel distance is going to  limit growth possibilities of a single city.                     Therefore you will have to specialize cities. One  can deliver stones, marble other will perform better with food  production.                                  </p>\n<p>                     What is more, game is going to take you through  multiple eras of human civilization advancements.                     Stone era will be a starting point. Primitive tools  and no transport technology will be slowing you down to fulfill basic  needs of your people.                     When your settlement will get bigger and start  constructing better and more specialized tools, new technologies are  going to allow you to build advanced houses, bring agriculture and  provide better quality of life.                                  </p>\n<p>                     You can unleash your creativity in Raise Your Civilization as world will be vast.                     All maps are going to be procedurally generated.                     Player will have few terrain types to select from.                     In this game you are not limited by map boundaries, it gives you a feel of planet.                     Going all the way west or north you can get to the same point where you have started.                     Sea transport can be the easiest way to get from one coast to another.                     All this immense world awaits to give you unlimited possibility for raising your very own civilization. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Project demo description:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I would love to get feedback about your software/hardware  configuration (GPU, CPU, RAM, Monitor[16:10, 16:9, others]) to get idea  what I'm missing and what performance are you getting. This Demo has FPS  counter (UE4 one) enabled by default to make this task easier. You also  send me details on how it took to start a new map for you.\r\n </p>\n<p>There will be still a lot of work ahead to make this game work for  most platforms and with this demo I want to start this process so first  playable release will be clean of initial problems with  software/hardware setup.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you spot any problems or game crashes logs can be found in this folder : RYC_Demo v0.0.3\\RYC_Demo\\Saved\\\r\n </p>\n<p>Please send me it via email: raiseyourcivilization@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p>What is available in this release you may ask? Its initial game  setup. You can randomize your map, select size generate map ready for  game-play and move around. I think this is just enough to spot any  compatibility issues or problems with some setups. This should give me  also good idea of performance on different hardware.\r\n </p>\n<p>Plan for this year is to polish compatibility and release a version  with game-play enabled. I want to push this project forward with small  steps, this small one is a milestone. Next few months I will make sure  that following this are ready:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li> <p>Game-play crashes are resolved\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>Working tutorial integrated with game-play\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>More details to HUD about civilization statistics\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>Save/Load system works fine\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>Options menu has more entries and configuration options\r\n \r\n</p></li></ul>\n<p> Sadly I cannot point exact date when this all will be completed, but I'm going to push that as hard as possible so first playable release of Raise Your Civilization will be available.</p>\n\n<p>You can get more details about project progress on Twitter or Main Project Page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T16:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a841b706d87ab5b761ffd3bdb4cb82c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Czochcio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
