Communities are isolated, but communication has advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.</p>\n<p>In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained in both aspects and tallied per lap, so it\u2019s important -- and tricky -- to manage the space better than the opponent.</p>\n<p>_________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>**\u00a0LOCAL\u00a0MULTI-PLAYER ONLY **</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(Two XBOX controllers recommended,</p>\n<p>at least one is required for controller share)</p>\n<p><strong>*^*^*</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Four locations and 3 modes,\u00a0for a total of 9 Tracks \u00a0&lt;&lt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt; 8 different mysterious special abilities &lt;&lt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*^*^*</strong></p>\n<p><em>Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a \u2018witch ball\u2019 is a glass orb hung in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the darkness. Games won\u2019t solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A game as a ward, not an escape.</em></p>\n<p>_________________________________________</p>\n<p>made with GameMaker Studio 1.4</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;\u00a0http://twentycapitalletters.com/Witchball\u00a0&gt;</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>IGF 2018,\u00a0</strong>Honorable Mention\u00a0- Nuovo Award<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ludicious\u00a0 2018, WINNER\u00a0-</strong> Innovation in Game Award<br/></p>\n<p><strong>IndieCade 2017, </strong>Official Selection<br/></p>\n<p><strong>IGF 2017</strong>,\u00a0Honorable Mention\u00a0- Nuovo Award<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e0aa68b42ea4262d950936c7b051d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S.L.Clark"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
