An Arcade game in which you must use your old school skills of T9 texting to do well in, the numpad is how to control the game, Best with your monitor on it's side in portrait. 5 on the numpad will start the game, 4 5 and 6 of the numpad on the game over screen will allow you to select the right buttons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>~~TIP : If you look at the buttons on screen and watch which ones light up, it's easier as we have the buttons on the numpad match the buttons on the phone, so 7 on the numpad is actually 1 on screen. So it's best to keep that in mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Platforms:\u00a0<br/>MS Windows</p>\n<p>Tools And Technologies:\u00a0<br/>Unity (any product)</p>\n<p>Technology Notes:\u00a0<br/>Blender, Photoshop, and Maya also used.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmed\u00a0by Marc Beaujean</p>\n<p>Art by\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lewis Cooper</p>\n<p>Justin Dolan</p>\n<p>\u00a0Alicja Ukleja (modelled and animated the little Nokia character)</p>\n<p>Sound by\u00a0Jordon Crow</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f5/8f5b0e3ad4fb81c765c7d0d0d3d39fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlicjaUkleja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
