{"id": 581533, "slug": "the-humble-shopkeeper", "name": "The Humble Shopkeeper", "name_original": "The Humble Shopkeeper", "description": "Story\r\n<p>You are a humble shopkeeper who has many adventurers who comes and goes from your little home.\u00a0You see many different faces each day, and you have plenty of stock to offer them.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use WASD for moving around, and E to interact with objects.</p>\r\nComments\r\n<p>This was made for the AAU JAM game jam, where the theme was \"You don't play the main character\".\u00a0We took the theme in a direction of where the main characters are taken in the context of the story, where you yourself is just an NPC character who sells items to the main characters who visit your humble shop.</p>\n<p>There are a few missing features and a few glitch spots to get into, but you are able to get out with ease. If there are any bugs you come upon that we have not noticed, please leave them in the comment.</p>\n<p>We recommend playing the game at least twice as well as looking around for the\u00a03 hidden easter eggs in the game, two of which you have to utilize the buggy mechanics of the game in order to find. Happy hunting gamers!</p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>POLYGON - Fantasy Characters, by Synty Studios (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/polygon-fantasy-characters-97186)</p>\n<p>Low Poly Fruit Pickups, by Rem Storms (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/food/low-poly-fruit-pickups-98135)</p>\n<p>Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack, by JustCreate (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153)</p>\n<p>Low Poly Dungeons Lite, by JustCreate (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/low-poly-dungeons-lite-177937)</p>\n<p>RPG Poly Pack - Lite, by Gigel (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/rpg-poly-pack-lite-148410)</p>\n<p>Standard Assets (for Unity 2018.4), by Unity Technologies (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2018-4-32351)</p>\n<p>Ultimate Low Poly Dungeon, by Broken Vector (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/ultimate-low-poly-dungeon-143535)</p>\n<p>Fireplace Sound Effect | Royalty free Sound Effects, by BurghRecords (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG64aIasFiw)</p>\n<p>RPG Sound Pack, by artisticdude (https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-sound-pack)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spring Birds Chirping SFX, by VideoPlasty (https://videoplasty.com/sound-effects/spring-birds-chirping-sfx-310)</p>\n<p>Free HDR Sky, by ProAssets (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/free-hdr-sky-61217)</p>\n<p>Fantasy Music - The Savvy Merchant, by Hitctrl (https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-music-the-savvy-merchant)</p>\n<p>Dababy turns into a convertible, by BizarreDiego (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfGql6suU-c)</p>\n<p>Among Us Drip Theme Song Original (Among Us Trap Remix / Amogus Meme Music), Leonz (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grd-K33tOSM)<br/></p><p>Minecraft: Villager Sound Effect (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=561xYvjMbNk)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d83ba5f69dce0804a8ce44240a3c5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lukas Brede", "skipperlicious", "mushu8"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
