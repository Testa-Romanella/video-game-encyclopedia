You need 10 Kitty Coins to pass a stage. However, each coin will enable/disable a platform on the map, obstructing your path to victory. Once you have 10 Kitty Coins, an exit door will spawn on the map (up to you to find it). Each stage has multiple ways of winning, and multiple ways of losing! </p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>Movement: Left/Right arrow keys</p><p>Jump: \"C\" (hold down for higher jump, press again to double jump)</p><p>Run: Hold \"X\"</p><p>A WebGL version is available at http://kaminarigames.com/projects.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90a/90a41640a281269d04a76c9ff3618cc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaminari"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
