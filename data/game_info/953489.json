(DEMO)", "description": "<p>Six anthropomorphic objects dwelled in the\u00a0void for as long as they could remember... until they didn't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Catfood, Aloe, Triangle, Fossil, Shroom, and Hourglass wake up in a cold, rose-colored field\u00a0and meet a mysterious pair of twins looking for their memories. Catfood, the self-proclaimed leader, notices how much they like asking questions and convinces them to pass the time by\u00a0hosting a game show with them and their five roommates as contestants. Our hosts' curiousity grows stronger every day... at least, they feel like days... but they aren't the only one remembering. As Catfood's companions try to remind them, everyone is still horribly lost. How will they get home? In a visual novel heavily inspired by object shows, can they unearth the truth together? Or will the bud of their friendship rot?</p>\n<p>Soundtrack: https://on.soundcloud.com/rh4uGiwX2Uku6aBJ9</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/muDASt7pbf</p>\n<p>Thanks a bunch\u00a0for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T15:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2f/b2fb2d0049483f642f084088a4015db6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mintykiwi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
