I chose turn-based stealth game and after a day I realised that it\u2019s not really incompatible, but by this point I could\u2019t start working on something new.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t really have any big goals in this game. The main goal is to get to the door on the other side of the level and that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>This game was more like a challange to finish the game more than make the game super good with audio and good graphics. It\u2019s something that I can always look down to and tell my self let\u2019s do better this time\u2026</p>\n<p>Even though the game is quite small I still hope you\u2019re gonna enjoy my 3 level\u2019s filled of bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67ca7a2555829a4f8a045e33be6ab385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hizrok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
