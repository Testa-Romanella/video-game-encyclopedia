You have been given a dirty fork! There is only one appropriate way to respond to this insult: Food Fight! Try to chase all of the customers away before the restaurant staff stops you.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Pick up food from various place settings around the restaurant, and throw it at unsuspecting customers. If you connect, the customer will leave in disgust, and you will increasingly annoy the restaurant staff. First the maitre 'd will try to put you in your place. Soon, waiters, chefs, and managers will come out of the kitchen to throw food back at you.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Can you drive away all of the customers before the staff puts an end to your rampage?\r\n    </p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>Break glass for bonus points.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Waiters cannot throw food at you unless they pick it up from the table. Chefs and managers have their own supply of food.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The manager throws food twice as often as the chef.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The maitre'd is hoity-toity and thus is above throwing food, favoring a hard slap.\r\n    </p>\n<p>This game was created for Ludum Dare 32.
