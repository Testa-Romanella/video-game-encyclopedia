The VN will treat heavy subjects (depression, suicide) and will most likely contain NSFW material at some point.<br/>However, as of this moment, the story is heavily comedic.\u00a0<br/>In Crescendo, you'll take the role of Will, a young musician that won a scolarship to Amewdeus Institute, one of the most prestigious universities dedicated to musical talents.<br/>During your stay, you'll meet our main cast: Lawrence, the eccentric and loud lion, Oliver, the good giant bull, and Riley, a quite timid yet bold rabbit.<br/>However, something terrible is hiding in the shadows, and as such, you will have to free your friends from the shackles created by their guilt and regrets in order to save them.<br/><br/>The game is still under production. Thank you for your patience.<br/>If you'd like to support us, we have a Patreon!\u00a0<br/><br/>Also please, make sure to bash me in the comments\u00a0 for whatever writing mistake I did *bonk*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a37d5f51e540b1e92c4cf5d0431e5fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Googs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
