But something is off... you can smell a strange, rotting smell. Suddenly, hordes zombified rival players are rushing at you! To escape and get to the end zone, you must pick your path wisely, utilize boost zones and meals to increase your energy, and avoid mud pits and tackling zombie linebackers\u00a0that can slow you down. Once you lose all your energy, it's game over!</p>\n<p>Use WASD keys to move. Press ESC key to cycle through available levels (I made this for a game jam, so I did not have enough time to make a proper menu, but it will definitely be added later). There are three levels of powerup meals: watermelon gives +10% energy, hamburger gives +25% energy, and ham shank gives +50% energy. The player starts out with 50% energy and gradually loses energy while running. While running in mud pits, your speed is halved, but while running in boost zones (yellow arrows) your speed is doubled. Plan your routes wisely to make it safely to the end zone!</p>\n<p>I came up with this game for Bear Jams, a game dev competition at my university. I only had about a day so it is still very incomplete. I definitely plan on fleshing it out, and I will release the full game at a certain point that is more polished and contains so many more mechanics, levels, and features. Feel free to leave any feedback which I will definitely take into consideration as I continue developing this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/869fd5586ec449b587387d5ffe095488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["robertqiu"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
