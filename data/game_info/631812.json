Contra is my big favorite to this day, though I find it heavy, but its music and atmosphere are unparalleled. I didn\u2019t manage to achieve exactly the same gameplay, but that wasn\u2019t the goal either. A retro style side view skill action game where I make every item. The story won\u2019t be overstated, as this genre has never been about that. But there will be recordable notes for storytelling on the tracks so we know why we\u2019re fighting! :) For now, developing alone is quite stressful and I don't always have the mood for it. :( But the goal always stays and I've never dealt with anything in my life for so long. I hope there will be two people who see something in it and will appreciate my attempt! Later I wish you could see a full game of it. Then I would start newer projects .<br/><br/><strong>The resolution only works at 1280x720 for now.</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading. And I posted a video of the situation so far to see what it\u2019s all about. (This is not complete, even here there will be changes in several places.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d28b29b03708e326fadaf47fae140e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndEE777"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
