All comments are welcome and will be considered for the\u00a0development of the\u00a0game.</em>\n\r\nOVERVIEW\r\n<p><em>Saudade</em> is a Portuguese word for <em>\"a nostalgic longing for something or someone that is distant\"</em>. And that's what this game is all about: a personal journey of self-(re)discovery to find the missing feeling of what was once called home.</p>\n<p>You will relieve the memories of an estranged family member, by taking control of past memories and choosing which particular moments in them are the right ones (the outcomes are on the player's hands) that the character used to remember well, in order to re\"feel\" their <em>saudade</em> meter and eventually return \"home\".</p>\n<p>This is a\u00a0prototype of a\u00a0rough version of one of the memories/puzzles of the game. Since we couldn't develop our entire idea on time, we've included our GDD in the downloads so you can get a better understanding of the story and overall game.</p>\n\r\nTEAM\r\n<p><strong>Beatriz Cesaroni</strong> | <em>Story<br/></em><strong>Jo\u00e3o Caseiro</strong> | <em>Programming<br/></em><strong>Mafalda Claro</strong> | <em>Art<br/></em><strong>Margarida Afonso</strong> | <em>Programming<br/></em><strong>Ricardo Sousa</strong>\u00a0 | <em>Graphic &amp; Game Design</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:48:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95b/95b2e40d62674ef564b498efa212c749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Ricardo M.
