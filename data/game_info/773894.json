You can play as either the human or the cat, and must compete in real-time with an opponent playing the opposite role.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Players must try to outscore their opponents by performing unique actions that grant themselves points but contradict the goal of their opponent. The cat\u2019s goal is to steal food around and cause as much damage as it can to the furniture in the house, while the human\u2019s goal is to complete chores and keep the house nice and tidy.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this cycle of kid vs kitty, only one player can come out on top. Will it be the child, fulfilling their responsibilities and satisfying their parents, or will the cat\u2019s destructive tendencies be their downfall?\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purrpatrator</strong> was developed by Dapnye, a team of passionate student developers from UOW KDU with a love of Malaysian culture and queerness.\u00a0The team consists of:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Valis Teoh</strong><br/>Lead Artist, Designer</li><li><strong>Euan Ooi Zhanyuan<br/></strong>Lead Programmer</li><li><strong>Johann Tan<br/></strong>Lead Designer</li><li><strong>Hew Wan Juin<br/></strong>3D Environmental Artist</li><li><strong>\u00a0Chan Soon Yee, Zovy\u00a0</strong><br/>Character Modeller and Animator</li><li><strong>Ainun Nawwarah</strong><br/>\r\nGame Mechanics Programmer\u00a0</li><li><strong>Yeong Chu Yao<br/>\n</strong>Multiplayer and\u00a0Game Mechanics Programmer\r\n</li><li><strong>Ng Wei Yuen</strong>\n<br/>Multiplayer and\u00a0Game Mechanics Programmer\r\n</li><li><strong>Noor Adriana Putri Binti Noor Zainy<br/>\n</strong>Technical Artist and Programmer\r\n</li><li><strong>\u00a0Chan Kwok Chun<br/></strong>Audio Programmer<br/></li></ul>\n<p>With Special Thanks and Guest Starring\u00a0<strong>:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ainun's own little kitty out of 35, Jacques!</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong><br/>Install Instructions:\u00a0<br/></strong>1.
