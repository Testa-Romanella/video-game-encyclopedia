Run through a city generated by music and don\u2019t fall off! In this game, four composers of different genre bring you a groove that you just can\u2019t resist jumping to. </p>\n<p>Instructions: Look around with the Mouse and Jump with \u201cW\u201d key. </p>\n<p>Recommendation: If you fail the first few times, don\u2019t worry! It takes some time to get used to the jumps. You\u2019ve got to play through and listen to all four songs, I promise it\u2019ll truly be worth it.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! </p>\n<p>Music in the order of play:<br/>1. The Edge of Horizon - by Albert Paix\u00e3o<br/>2. Space Race - by Taylor Fortes<br/>3. Some Planets - RicharPK<br/>4.
