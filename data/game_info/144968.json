Put your index finger in front of your face. Focus on it. Now keep your finger there, and focus on something else in the background. You see two fingers now, right? STEREOJO takes that double vision effect and the player uses that to his advantage. Still don't understand? Play the game and you'll see what I mean.</p><p>Wish I could make more levels for the Compo! This is definitely a game I will continue development on.<br/></p><p>If you've streamed this game on Twitch already, let me know in the comments. <br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter: @ccolongames<br/><br/>Become a Patron: patreon.com/ccolongames<br/><br/>Check out my other LDs or some other games I've made, at: ccolongames.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/6135695a2533ffd3cf4e01dc8e4cc176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["c: Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
