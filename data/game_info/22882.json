There were books to sort, dust, and put away, important royal documents to transcribe. All this was swept away by the deadly plague that devastated the Kingdom of Ash. The plague killed quickly, so quickly that no one has the time to bury the dead, instead they are thrown, without ceremony, into the Pit. Azra, infected with the plague, is cast into the Pit. Soon, she finds herself in the Half-Way World, the place between life and death and learns of her true power--that of being able to bring anyone into the Half-Way World with her.
