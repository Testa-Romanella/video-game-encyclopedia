Mystic Quest, and the remake of Final Fantasy 3 on the DS. Oh, right, the story. Ok so you're name is Kade and you've come back from a long trip only to find out your home town has been taken over by a gang called \"The Mayors\"(cus y'know, they take over towns- ok I know its a dumb joke). You meet up with your friend, Melody, who is a Red Mage capable of using both Black and White magic. You and Melody beat the gang leader and then head on over to Falgabard to check up on it. You meet an Archer named Tidus, who agrees to join you to help out in some caves to the west of town. At the bottom of the cave, you meet the main bad guy(I'm not telling you his name. You gotta find out yourself), who just kicks your party's ass. That's basically it for the demo. It really only takes like, 10 or so minutes to beat.
