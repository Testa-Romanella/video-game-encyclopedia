He lives with his daughter Jessica, but they live far in the forest, just between the city and the plains were he can harvest evrerything and more efficiently. Since there are no schools on the forest, Thomas has to take Jessica\u00a0\u00a0to the city...where everyone lives. Normally, Thomas showed up at exactly 2:00 PM to take back Jessica to the house. But, a special ocassion showed up, Jessica made some friends which convinced Thomas to let Jessica go with them to the city for some hours. Skeptically, he accepted. The clock marked 6 o\u00b4clock...nothing. 7 o\u00b4clock, nothing, she didn\u00b4t return. So he called the family from the city, to ask them how Jessica was doing...The rest is up to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b34e9d8450bafff555132e15aa659a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iKnoware Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
