I have played a lot of firefighting games, and they never seem to get it right, so I decided to make it myself. I have been a Volunteer Firefighter at an urban department that runs a high volume of calls for about 9 years, and a Paid Firefighter/EMT for 4 years now. I wanted to make a game that was fun, yet engaging for everyone while stile sticking to the correct details.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to stop by the discord, check out the latest updates,\u00a0 screenshots, and say hello!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/gG8Nacg<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/IntoTheFlames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b57a629f473453cedf6668860029d419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FullyInvolvedGameStudios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
