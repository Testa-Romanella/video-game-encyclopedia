You will be awarded 750 pts for each diamond collected.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            When all diamonds have been picked up, an <em>exit</em> will open in one of the corners of the maze. Escape through this exit to reach the next level.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            One or two arrows will appear on screen to guide you to the currently closest off-screen diamond, or to the location of the maze exit.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            Some useful tools will appear at random locations in the maze:\r\n          </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick up a <em>tar barrel</em> to be able to create tar pits, which will slow down enemies passing through them.
