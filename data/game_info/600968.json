Each player may also arm traps that are laid out around the map that help delay or hinder the ability of the monster. To escape, the 3 survivors must complete a sequence of objectives while avoiding the monster before the time expires. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe monster must hunt and eliminate all 3 survivors, using their abilities to aid the hunt, while also avoiding traps armed by survivors. If a survivor is eliminated, they must continue to work as a ghost to light up torches and arm traps to aid the other survivors. The monster\u2019s objective is to eliminate all the survivor players before they finish all their objectives and escape from the castle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T02:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711ae0642d2455b4f1bd5886665f8b14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freethrow"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freethrow"], "esrb_rating": null}
