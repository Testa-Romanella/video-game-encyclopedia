It's a little rough but the two of us have worked towards this little visual novel game for the best part of a few months. Feel free to play this and give a little love to our social media pages so that we may be able to continue production and perhaps if there's enough engagement we can Kickstarter this project further to hopefully create the full game we planned on in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Find us on Twitter:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@lydsarts\u00a0 @Cowna247</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To The Divide Discord Server:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://discord.gg/Scckhw26QP</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Thank You!\u00a0</p><p><em>Instructions for Download:</em></p><p><em>1.
