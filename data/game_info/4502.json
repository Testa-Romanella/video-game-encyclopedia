Two kingdoms, Heaven and Hell, could never solve their disagreements and battled each other from the beginning of time. &quot;The Charred Council&quot; arose in between two sides forming the brotherhood of Four Horsemen - War, Death, Strife and Fury. With these for horsemen on the watch and all the conflicts end, humanity has been born - a &quot;Kingdom of Man&quot;. Council has created Seven Seals, that must be broken, when &quot;The Kingdom of Man&quot; will be ready for an Endwar. When our protagonist, War arrives on Earth, he sees that the final battle between Good and Evil already emerged without breaking Seven Seals. After fighting a demon called Straga, he is summoned by the council. It accuses him of destroying the balance, and that now the Apocalypse is unstoppable. Convincing the council in his innocence, War now has to stop the Endwar.</p>\n<p>Darksiders is a typical hack-and-slash game that lets you produce comboes with two primary weapons - Chaoseater and Scythe - and various gadgets. While defeating his enemies, War can execute them with brutality. The gameplay is undertoned with dark mythology bound with the present days.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2010-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T16:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8d4/8d46786ca86b1d95f3dc7e700e2dc4dd.jpg", "website": "http://www.darksiders.com", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 350, "owned": 5813, "beaten": 966, "toplay": 109, "dropped": 419, "playing": 28}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 199, "ratings_count": 1181, "suggestions_count": 667, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 1184, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["THQ", "Vigil Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
