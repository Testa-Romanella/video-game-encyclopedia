This game was born from the two prompts, 'Green' and '... Simulator'.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever wondered what it was like to be a plate of vegetables?</strong> Chances are, you haven\u2019t. But screw you, I made a simulator that has you playing as a <strong>plate of vegetables.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Four buttons.</strong> That\u2019s all you need. Oh, and four small ones. (<em>just in case you want to see a plate of vegetables eat someone</em>)</p>\n<p><strong>Just press a button to trigger an animation.</strong> It\u2019s as simple as that. There are also alt animations that you can trigger by pressing the small buttons above the regular ones. The animation will loop until you press a letter key, or when you click the background.</p>\n<p>The plate of vegetables will also say something random when you click on it. I guarantee you that it will <strong>not</strong> try to rickroll you(\u2e2e), because it's\u00a0<em>never gonna give you up,</em> plus I'm\u00a0<em>never gonna let you down</em>.</p>\n<p>Now including a non-working close button, because you're\u00a0<em>never gonna run around and desert it.</em></p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>A terrible game this is, because I have basically zero experience in game development and it was built on Scratch.</p>\n<p>This game has an HTML build (<em>works on every system.</em>) and of course, a Linux build (<em>for 64-bit x86 systems only. It won't work on ARM devices and Raspberry Pi devices</em>).</p>\n<p><em>I hope you enjoy playing my game :)</em></p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>This game was built using <strong>TurboWarp</strong> (<em><strong>Scratch</strong>, but harder, better, faster, and stronger. Both open-source</em>), packaged with <strong>TurboWarp Packager</strong> (<em>open-source</em>). Game was tested on <strong>Kubuntu</strong> (<em>open-source, of course</em>). This description was also written with an open-source Markdown editor called <strong>ghostwriter</strong> (<em>very good Markdown editor, I\u2019m currently using it to write a book</em>), and also <strong>Markor</strong> (<em>also a good Markdown editor. and it\u2019s for Android</em>).</p>\n<p>All images in the game are stock images unless mentioned here. Project banner, game background and animated scenes were created with <strong>Krita</strong> (<em>open-source</em>).</p>\n<p>Background music: <strong>Dandy and Swell</strong> by Cleod9 on McLeodGaming.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T09:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0e/f0e87eb0427b2af284b9eb3c539e2e40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sir-Ivysaur"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
