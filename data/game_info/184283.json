Of course feel free to give me feedback but don't be too harsh please :) Hopefully overtime I can polish this to make it as presentable as possible. I'm aware of current bugs in the UI and the MAJOR! lack of levels but I'm only one guy. My game was also intended to be played on mobile but there are even more problems with the android version because of compression issues. Its still...
