Set your car the way it fits for your driving skills and racing conditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Revhead is about to build and race with your dream car and while all of your racing skills will be required to beat others on a track, you also have to master mechanical skills to be able to fix, maintain or re-build your car.<br/>A real car is built up from thousands of components. Each connected to each-others and they are working together as a car. In this game, every car is built up from dozens of individual components, connected to each-other the same way as in reality. Each component can be removed, replaced and swapped between other cars. This way, you can not only customise your paint work and outlook, but the handling and performance of the car as well.<br/><br/><strong>Understand your car!</strong><br/><br/>Watch your car when driving, how is it handling, how smoky is it or what noise coming from the hood. All these can help you to identify the real problem.<br/>You need a 4x4 but you don\u2019t have the budget? Buy a wreck cheap car and transfer it to a 4x4 supercharged racing beast, using wrecked cars and used components from the newspaper.<br/>You engine is strong, but your car don\u2019t reach the speed you need? Make sure your gears and differential also matching with your goals!<br/><br/>Racing and what is behind it<br/><br/>In the reality, racing is about 80% mechanical work, 19% testing and 1% racing. In this game, we try to get closer to this, while we still wanted to keep the fun.
