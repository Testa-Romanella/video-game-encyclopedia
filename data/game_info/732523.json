Destroy entire worlds with terrifying new planet-killer weapons, fight against (or alongside) ruthless space pirates, and maybe discover a few non-violent game features as well. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nStellaris: Federations<br/>\nThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. With the Stellaris: Federations expansion, players can extend their diplomatic dominion over the galaxy like never before. Use every trick in the book to gain an edge on friend and foe alike, with a host of new options to influence, manipulate, and dominate without firing a shot. <br/>\n<br/>\nStellaris: MegaCorp<br/>\nStellaris: MegaCorp is the full expansion for Stellaris, which has players ushering in an era of prosperity and profit on a galactic scale. In this economy-focused expansion, players can become the CEO of a powerful corporate empire to expand operations across the stars.  <br/><br/>\nStellaris: Nemesis<br/>\nNemesis is an expansion to Stellaris in which the player will be able to determine the fate of a destabilizing galaxy. Adding espionage tools, a path to power as the Galactic Custodian to combat endgame crises - or the Menace option to BECOME the endgame crisis - Nemesis gives you the most powerful tools ever available in Stellaris.<br/>\nUltimately you will have to make the choice between chaos or control, to take charge of a galaxy spiraling into crisis. Will you find a way to take power through diplomacy or subterfuge, or will you watch the stars go out one by one?<br/><br/>\nStellaris: Utopia<br/>\nThe stars have called you for millennia and now you walk among them. A universe of possibilities is open to your species as it takes its first fitful steps into the great unknown. Here you can turn your back on the divisive politics of the home planet. Here you can build something new. Here you can unify your people and build that perfect society. Only in space can you build Utopia.  <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T20:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7f/c7fcc2c004d91c63ffd3fa7fe1ef838e.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 398, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Paradox Development Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
