{"id": 197373, "slug": "murinus", "name": "Murinus", "name_original": "Murinus", "description": "<p>Important:\u00a0This is my first time shipping a game with SDL2, so if I missed any libraries feel free to comment below and I'll try to add them.</p>\n<p>Murinus is a game inspired by old arcade games, containing 35 levels which in you can collect treasure and avoid getting eaten by snakes. The game is currently lacking sounds and music, and doesn't have an ending or boss to fight.<br/></p>\n<p>The controls are WASD+left shift+space for player 1 and Arrow Keys+right shift/backspace+enter for player 2, if only one player is playing, both work. The first time the game is run and exited, \"options.xml\" will be created, where you can change the keybindings if you know the keycodes for it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In-game there you can change some of the other options too:</p>\n<ul><li>Character (P1)/(P2) let's you choose between 4 skins to play as</li><li>UseTap currently does nothing</li><li>EdgeSlip makes you move towards the closest opening if you are running into a wall. Changing the number changes how many squares away from the opening you can be and still have it take effect.</li><li>QuickCourner gives you a little leeway when going around courners, making it so you don't have to be exactly in front of the opening to be able to move into it.\u00a0</li><li>Show Divert makes the snakes change color when they divert from their preferred route.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p>The game has single-player and multi-player co-op, but both uses the same set of levels. The 5 different gamemodes just change the order of the level/difficulties you encounter:</p>\n<ul><li>Beginner - First runs through all levels on the lowest difficulty, then the same levels on medium difficulty, then hard.</li><li>Intermediate - Same as beginner but allows you to skip playing the levels on the lowest difficulty</li><li>Advanced - Same as Intermediate but allows you to skip playing the levels on the medium difficulty</li><li>Beginner's Adventure - Switches back and forth between playing levels on the lowest and medium difficulty.</li><li>Intermediate's Adventure - Switches back and forth between playing levels on all the different difficulties.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Any feedback is welcome, I work on the game every now and then, but I probably won't do any major changes any time soon.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac6/ac62021bb320dd8da8db654277790973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ITR"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
