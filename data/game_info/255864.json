This is not your game. You, together with other players, have been kidnapped and brought to a forest, with an unknown creature living there. Now, surviving is your only objective. Players have to be constantly looking for resources: food, weapons, ammunition, drugs, etc. This is the only way you can gain advantage over the other players. The show goes on until there is only one player surviving, and the survivor is the winner.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89e/89eb98cacdcd69000f29b9eaf62a35b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Biscuit Play"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Biscuit Play"], "esrb_rating": null}
