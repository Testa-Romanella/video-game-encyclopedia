This game is NOT a mainstream FPS. It is a SIMULATION focused on including real effects and challenges that comes together when shooting a Real Firearm that is usually not present in mainstream FPSs.\u00a0So, for hardcore gamers, prepare yourself for a new challenge!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no \"instant laser rays\" coming out from your eyes as fake bullets, this simulation consists of a\u00a0Real Physics bullet coming out from the gun's barrel, following a Parabolic/Ballistic Trajectory, so, you will have to deal with parallax effects when aiming and much more, like spinning motion, air drag, drift,\u00a0bullet instability, spiral movement effect, etc... For longer distance shots these effects becomes even more noticeable and affects the real point of impact. You will have a hard time trying to\u00a0hit something at 300 meters if you use a pistol, but with assault rifles that gets achievable, but it's not easy! You will have to master the specific weapon's behavior before you could hit a Bullseye\u00a0at such long ranges!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Bullet Dynamics calculations and Weapon's behavior includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Highly sensitivity aiming method with Parallax effect on the sights.</li><li>Bullet mass, spin, instability along trajectory, muzzle speed, barrel length, weapons's weight, rate of fire, aiming oscillation and more\u2026</li><li>Real-time internal calculation values based on real data from the Bullets and Weapons manufacturers.
