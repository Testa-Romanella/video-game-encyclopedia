Or rather, specific elements of it.<br/></p><p>The pixelisation is at PS1 resolution. The background seems \"static\" because the camera doesn't really reorient itself, but rather slides to different elements of the rendered scene. <br/></p><p>The main difference between this and the original FF7 (apart from the graphics engine, obviously), is that my background isn't a series of prerendered image, but rendered in real time. Because of this, I couldn't get the antialiasing on the background without it affecting the character too, but that's really the only visible consequence of this choice.<br/></p><p>Well, that and the fact that the character casts, and can recieve, shadows, but that could be easily deactivated. I just went with what looked better, to me.<br/></p><p>I don't know if I'll do a whole project with this, but I'm really happy to have experimented with this.<br/></p><p>Arrow Keys / Joystick to move, Left Shift / A Button to sprint.
