{"id": 13158, "slug": "kombine", "name": "Kombine", "name_original": "Kombine", "description": "Kombine is a minimalist puzzle game played on a grid. The goal is to remove all of the blocks that have borders by matching three or more of the same blocks together. When blocks are matched, a new block is created with the same color and a higher value. Three 1s create a 2, three 2s create a 3, etc. However, you can only place blocks with a 1 value, so it can become challenging to create a match with higher value blocks. There are 50 levels to play through in both normal and time trial modes. In time trial mode, you play quickly through 10 levels at a time trying to get the best time.<br/><br/>Optional Keys<br/><ul><li>M = mute/unmute sound<br/></li><li>B = toggle background scrolling<br/></li><li>Esc = exit game when on menu</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a31220bd7736c2217d3a0615366dd0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 117, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Robert Alvarez"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Alvarez"], "esrb_rating": null}
