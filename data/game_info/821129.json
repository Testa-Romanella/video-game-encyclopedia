If that's the case i recommend disabling SFX using the button on the right side or downloading the executable and playing it like so.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Chill and relax while playing <strong>Duzzle</strong>: A soothing block puzzle game.</p>\n<p>Feel free to share your high score in the comments!</p>\n<p><em>Made by 39 using Python and pygame<br/></em></p>\n\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>The game is not a usual block puzzle game though. Before every tile you receive, you get to roll the dice and the tile's size is going to be based on the number you roll.</p>\n<p>This twist comes from the GMTK Game Jam 2022 with the theme \"Roll of the Dice\".</p>\n<p>Since Duzzle was made for the jam, it has accordingly been made within a time frame of 48 hours. 21 of those hours were actively spent on the development of this game.</p>\n<br/>How to play\r\n<p>You start out with an empty 10x10 grid. To receive a tile which you can use to fill the grid, either press the ROLL button with the hand image at the bottom on the right, or press the AUTO button so you don't have to roll manually each and everytime.</p>\n\n<p>When placing a tile, your score gets added by the size of the placed tile.</p>\n<p>Once a row or a column has no free tiles anymore, it gets cleared so you can keep on playing.</p>\n<p>If there is no possible move you can do anymore, you lost and can play again by pressing the RETRY button. So make sure to fill as many rows and columns as possible!</p>\n\n\r\nInfo\r\n<p>This game was made in Python using the game library pygame. One person worked on this game. Playing in the web is possible through a kind of new technology named pygbag/pygame-wasm.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>39 (me)<ul><li>Development</li><li>Assets (images, sound)</li><li>Everything else</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>My dog<ul><li>Mental\u00a0support</li></ul></li><li>flaticon<ul><li>ROLL button icon</li><li>SFX/Music toggle button icons</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>StrangeKioH<ul><li>Background music (\"Some Changes\")<br/></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Pygame &amp; Pygbag<ul><li>Providing the library and exportation to HTML5</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>1010<ul><li>The game i took inspiration from</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97ee72bae37d37052b1a1e3145ea8334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["39"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
