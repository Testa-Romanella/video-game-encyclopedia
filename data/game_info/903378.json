Pretty happy that\u00a0 I managed to end up with a prototype. I also had the chance to create all the 2D graphics on paper which was great! I actually had that idea for quite a while but I never tried it. It was an exciting experience. I wish\u00a0 I could do more but it wasn't possible with my limited skills and the busy program of December.<br/><br/><strong>I did learn a lot of things about Unity which is great!</strong><br/><br/>Anyway, here is a game where 2D, 3D,\u00a0 analog, and digital come together. The theme of \"Deja -Vu\" is implemented by the main character's ability to control time. The idea is to be able to stop and reverse time. <br/><br/>Graphics, Sound Effects, Music, Programming, and Game Design are all made by me!<br/><br/><strong>How to play<br/><br/>- WASD to move<br/><br/>- Move over an item to collect it<br/><br/>- When available press f to Freeze Time<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Blender for 3D modeling and rigging<br/></p>\n<p>- Texture Lab for texture creation.</p>\n<p>- Reaper for audio effects creation.</p>\n<p>- Audacity for audio editing.</p>\n<p>- Waveform for music production</p>\n<p>- Procreate to edit 2D graphics<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/></p>\r\n\r\nThe_Runner_01 \u00b7 Time Stop!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T08:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63a22389d35dd2a6c88856920f9592e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The_Runner_01"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
