I re-balanced player speed and put there those missing level assets. I also ditched level generation. There is no music or level progression here. There is some collision issues, enemies sometimes get stuck etc.</p>\n<p>Here is our Ludum Dare 48 subscription, go play it first:</p>\n<p>https://kovalok.itch.io/surinapiri-suruvuori<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Move: WASD\r\n</p>\n<p>Turn: Arrow Left, Arrow Right\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoot: Space\r\n</p>\n<p>Change weapon: Q &amp; E\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause: Esc</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a week now since you fell into that river. You we\u2019re not strong enough to battle against forces of nature, and you sank. You sank deeper and deeper, and you thought this was your end. Maybe it was, because the place you found below the river bed sure ain\u2019t nothing like you ever saw before. You never lost your vision of the sky, yet all the ladders in this world are only going down, deeper and deeper.\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>kovalok: Programming Player and enemies\r\n</li><li>Jamideus: Programming UI\r\n</li><li>Atik: Programming level generation\r\n</li><li>JormaRysky: 3D, sprites and overall look\r\n</li><li>CodingDuck: Music and sound effects\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:54:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/849e36aa3f5aedac9cfc311381e773b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jorma_Rysky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
