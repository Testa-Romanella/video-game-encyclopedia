We've been in need of someone with your expertise. Things have been, well... weird! But not as weird as we thought. A defector has disclosed the existence of a holo-defense grid, which might explain some the strange crap we've been seeing. The generator is located on the tenth floor of this building, and we need you to destroy it. Try to pick up as many data chips as you can find, as they are vital to the effort. All guards in the building are robots, but be careful Captain! The holo-grid is still active. Nothing is as it appears.</p><p>New mouse controls:</p><p>Click:</p><p>Green to move</p><p>Blue to turn</p><p>Red to shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/8878ca806722b3a3a4890a68785c317e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KeithK"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
