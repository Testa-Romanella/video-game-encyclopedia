It\u2019s a world that\u2019s made for teens for both the purposes of education and socialization. In it, teens can access the different worlds of the metaverse with ease.</p>\n<p>The color palette we\u2019ve chosen is a brightly colored one that\u2019s normally associated with topics like school. We\u2019ve also drawn inspiration from surrealist artist Paul Klee, as his work showcases bright colors and more geometric shapes and configurations.</p>\n<p>Energetic Drink by LesFM | https://lesfm.net/energetic-background-music/</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f8c177a73b746cd27bbdfad53f5c8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hspchung"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
