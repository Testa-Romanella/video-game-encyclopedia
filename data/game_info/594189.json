Now it is a nuclear arms race.</p>\n<p>You are a tortoise, strapped to a rocket. Your mission is to deliver a special payload to put an end to the conflict once and for all, before all is lost. You must reach the target before you run out of fuel.<br/></p>\n<p>This game takes only about 2-3 minutes to play - but they are very intense minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows to steer the rocket. Let go of the controls to automatically steer back towards the direction of the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Avoid the hares' anti-aircraft carrot turret towers.</li><li>Fly through green tortoise rings for a speed boost.</li><li>Clouds will slow you down drastically, and have plenty of turbulence, but will hide you from the anti-aircraft turrets.</li><li>Turrets can't aim down.</li><li>Don't crash into the turrets or ground.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>OST Jam Vol. 2</strong><br/>Made in ~4 days for OST Jam Vol. 2, where you start with one of the provided soundtracks and make a game out of it. I used\u00a0Actual Warfare by InkedSplat.</p>\n<p>In this jam, my goal was to get back into Unity after almost 2 months using another engine intensely, and to\u00a0play around with the Clayxels tool for Unity. Except for the particle effects, all the art is made using Clayxels!</p>\n<p><strong>Third Party Attributions</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong>Actual Warfare by Inkedsplat</li><li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Clayxels by Spare Parts Oasis</li><li><strong>Sound Effects</strong> from:\u00a0\u00a0Universal Sound FX pack</li><li><strong>Fonts</strong>: DCC Ash by dccanim; Bebas Neue by Dharma Type</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T08:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a48841e064ff0b5eb37634fc0b0ac7b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
