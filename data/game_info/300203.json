After receiving a premonition from a strange dream, he heads out to find out just why he's been afflicted, and what can be done to rid himself of the curse.</p>\n<p>Made with RPG Maker MV, and heavily inspired by games like OFF and Space Funeral, this is my first big project after a few practice projects. It's my hope to create a short and easy game that fans of said games can enjoy. <br/></p>\n<p>A lot of the things in this game are placeholder, and I don't have much time to complete the project anymore. That being said, I don't want the work I've put into the game to go to waste, so I am making the game public for the foreseeable future.<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any questions/suggestions/feedback/bugs to report, please contact me at clanes.tumblr.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d153b1b56b7cf4464fd2b85ec25146ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Clanes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
