So only 1 room can be active at a time, other players would end up joining as spectators.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spectators need to try to stay active, coz the server would automatically kick a user if they didn't type anything.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T14:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dacf67e14b1c37efa0650d7c2b193843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kenze Kua"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
