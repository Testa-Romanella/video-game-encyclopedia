It takes after Dragon Quest, presenting its battles in a similar way and with a familiar medieval fantasy aesthetic (though the game also features steampunk elements too, similar to Final Fantasy VI, which was released after this game).</p>\n<p>It also homages Dragon Quest indirectly by focusing the game around a quest given to the hero by a dragon: Ralph, the blond swordsman hero, is tasked by one of the two powerful dragon gods that rule the world to protect it from evil. On Ralph&#39;s journey, he meets and partners up with: Theo, a priest and healer; Liz, an adventurer who hails from the technologically advanced Underworld; and Lumiess, a member of the race of fairies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-24T12:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/92b/92b5505bcb583fdee4c1102b68852715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["I'Max"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
