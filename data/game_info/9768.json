With GameGuru released we will continue to improve and develop it further. All existing customers will receive lifetime updates free of charge. <br/><br/><strong>Choosing Your Game Engine</strong><br/><br/>GameGuru is not designed to compete with professional development tools such as Unity, Unreal and Cry-engine which are ideally suited to producing commercial apps and games. GameGuru is a recreational game maker, not a professional tool, and is still very much in development.  GameGuru is unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision on the game making tool for you.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f24/f24122a8e3d30ec3e99472e3e826d0cb.jpg", "website": "https://www.game-guru.com/", "rating": 1.89, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 106, "owned": 2398, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 32}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 128, "suggestions_count": 539, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 128, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Game Creators"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["The Game Creators"], "esrb_rating": null}
