SERIOUSLY.<br/>In Feb 2015, as part of the Battlecruiser twenty-five year anniversary celebration, a refresh of Universal Combat 2.0 was released for FREE for a limited time.<br/><br/>Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the infamous Battlecruiser series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier's systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders).<br/><br/>When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them<br/><br/>In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. <br/><br/>In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE (we also refreshed this game in 2014 and released as a Steam exclusive)  which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the UCCE game and released it as Universal Combat Collector's Edition v2.0.<br/><br/>This ultimate space capital ship combat compendium spans over two decades and represents the evolution of hard core space combat sims.
