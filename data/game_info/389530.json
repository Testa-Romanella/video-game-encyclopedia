The game has some RPG mechanics, but has changed to have more sandbox mechanics now. You use the various items at your disposal to create your own civilization and fend off raiders. These items include artillery, workers, builders, and many more aesthetic items. In the future\u00a0I plan to add more dynamic elements and a real enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/54832dac771ea9add0119fee9fbc1f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
