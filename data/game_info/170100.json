{"id": 170100, "slug": "threaded", "name": "THREADED (itch)", "name_original": "THREADED (itch)", "description": "\"THREADED\" is a game about avoiding obstacles of your same color. You can control your own shape, becoming narrower or wider. When you are narrow, the speed increases, making it harder to dodge the coming obstacles but easier to pass through the gaps, and vice-versa. The game can be played by up to 4 players at the same time, the single player mode being a practice mode. With more players, it's about who survives the longest. Visually, the running tracks of each player are overlaid on top of each other, adding a bit of confusion but also making the game more fun. It supports gamepad controllers as well as keyboard input.<br/>\r\nMade by: <br/>Denice Wagner - graphic, concept<br/>Tommy Friese - graphic, concept<br/>Christiaan Janssen - programming<br/>Norman Ritter - idea, concept, sfx and musicDeveloped at the Berlin Mini Game Jam October 2015.<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/21547d1b1bb1ba9a137e62a47b122e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AlphaBoy80s"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
