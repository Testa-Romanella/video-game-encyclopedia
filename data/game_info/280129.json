In this game, she is the protagonist.</p>\n\n<p>The story of this game takes place in the 23rd century. Crushie - The bone crusher, a human from the 21th century went through a resurection process, but it failed. There was only one way to save his life: to transfer his soul into the body of a cat. This happened to thousands of people.<br/>After finding out that Nyanners, a friend from the 21st century, was located in a resurrection center that was about to be destroyed,\u00a0 Crushie rushed to save her. However, the whole facility was guarded by fierce mechanical creatures.<br/>One of their leaders, \"The Shilkworm\", fell in love with Taylor's soul.</p>\n<p>After many adventures together, someone evil broke Nyanners's mind into multiple shards. Crushie brought her to the Tower of dreams, in order to save her once again. Now, in order to survive, Taylor has to heal her mind through dreams of her past life.</p>\n\n\n<p>The game is structured in several areas:</p>\n<p>Overworld - this is where all \"fictional sci-fi real-life events\" take place</p>\n<p>Metadream - this is the most stable area in Taylor's mind. It grants her a comforting safety that she couldn't find in other dreams. The Metadream takes the form of places where Taylor lived a longer time in her former life, such as her appartment, her room where she started recording videos and streams, etc. The Metadream is also constantly evolving, depending on the dreams Taylor went through. As she dreams more, she remembers more about her<br/>past.</p>\n<p>Dream Firewall - (NOT YET IN THE GAME - I'll add it in the next update) - The role of the Dream Firewall is to prepare Nyanners for entering a dream. It will feature some sort of arcade gameplay.</p>\n<p>Dreams - Dreams can be accessed by searching for posts on the Nyanners's real-life Twitter page. The game has a built-in web browser that lets players click on Taylor's tweets. Clicking certain tweets could open portals to dreams/dream firewalls. Generally, playable dreams will have a direct relationship with the tweet's content. So, in other words, this game turns Nyanners's tweets into playable gameplay experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - move</p>\n<p>E - interact or pick up object</p>\n<p>Hold E after pick up and release = Throw object</p>\n<p>Q- Toggle First/Third Person camera</p>\n<p>Scroll Wheel - zoom in/out</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Shift - sprint/dodge attacks (works when controlling Crushie)</p>\n<p>1,2,3,4 - change graphics settigs, from very low to very high</p>\n<p>9 - load story level</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Developer - NyannersFanM</p>\n<p>Voice Acting - Nyanners\u00a0 (all her voice samples are taken from her videos or from Nyan Nyanners, her UTAU voice bank)</p>\n<p>Other assets credits are in the credits.txt file<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a45481a1b98f26b469fb882996efda3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Love Nyanners"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
