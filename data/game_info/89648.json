Draw your own routes for your receivers then hike the ball and play. Try to beat the defense and score touchdowns. The game is played with a  variable time limit of 2, 5 or 15 minutes, score as many points within this timeframe as possible. You will always play on the offense.<br/><br/>The quarterback can run or pass the ball. A backwards pass can be thrown again - try plays like the flea flicker. Defense can intercept the ball which will restart from the original line of scrimmage. If a first down is not made after 4 tries you restart from the original line of scrimmage.<br/><br/>Three difficulty levels: high school, college and pro. The harder the difficulty the higher the scores.<br/><br/>Stats are accumulated such as total yards passing, total yards rushing, total touchdowns scored.<br/><br/>SCORING:<br/>A passing touchdown will score 6 points and your team will be awarded points based on yards.<br/>A rushing touchdown will score 7 points and your team will be awarded 2x points based on yards.<br/><br/>Game Center supported - see how you compare on the global leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:22:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b6553adbc14ff5f1532d816af7e523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Les Bird"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Les Bird"], "esrb_rating": null}
