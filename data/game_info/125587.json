I chose to explore the impact that discriminatory legislation has on society. It doesn't just impact the people directly targeted by the legislation. When our governments discriminate they normalise that discrimination for everyone else. They make it seem okay to judge people and treat them differently based on their gender, their orientation, their ethnicity, their skin colour or their faith. It's not okay and it never should be. Behind every group or category is individual people. Discrimination harms those people in very real ways. </p><p>Together explores that by putting you in government and deciding whether you'll support or oppose discrimination. The choice is yours ... as are the consequences. And you'll see those consequences play out on the three individuals moving through their daily lives. You'll also see how the people view your stance compared to theirs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b666bb09f22eb9f331bdf8d7320e9e13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
