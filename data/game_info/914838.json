{"id": 914838, "slug": "sandbox-war-dispatch", "name": "Sandbox War Dispatch", "name_original": "Sandbox War Dispatch", "description": "1. Base type and internal division. There are a total of 8 types of base units in the game, namely the capital, oil plant, steel plant, submarine base, aircraft carrier port, military base, missile base, and anti-missile interception base. During the game, both players will get an upgrade opportunity at intervals, a total of 15 times. You can choose to build a military base at a certain location for each upgrade. A military base is a unit that can create an army in the game besides the capital. Each type of base has 2 to 4 small divisions. These divisions are close to different intersections and exit points. Only when all the small divisions are occupied by the enemy, the base will surrender to the enemy. Under this setting of guarding a single entrance and exit, the internal divisions of the base There are also fences, the purpose of which is to prevent the attacker from easily infiltrating other partitions, forcing the attacker to adopt tactics around the rear. The grade of the fence is divided into two grades from 1 to 2. The first-level fence can only prevent infantry units from crossing over, and the second-level fence needs to consumes resources to upgrade the anti-tank hedgehogs, which can prevent tanks from infiltrating, and the advantage of expensive helicopter units is that they can directly infiltrate all partitions regardless of the internal wall defense.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. The way the army moves. The move navigation systems of the three armies are based on the same navigation grid plane. This navigation road network is built according to the terrain, and many key paths only connect to a unique partition of the city base. When the army is in the garrison state when it is first created inside the base, click the direction icon in the army column to automatically open the path planning panel. Extra marching method - airborne by transport plane, click the parachute button to edit the air landing point, this function can only be used when the small left section of the military base is not occupied by the enemy. When the army is in the field area, you can also click the icon above the head to edit the movement route. When the army moves to the enemy army or enemy base, it will automatically enter the combat state and cannot continue to move. The defender can use this blocking strategy to delay the enemy's marching time .<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3. Combat system and numerical introduction. There are two battle modes: urban battle and field battle. Urban battle is automatically triggered after the attacker moves to the defender's base through pathfinding. It should be noted that the attack route choice of the attacker will affect the location of the attack zone. It is automatically determined by the route and the geographical distance of the urban area. Combined with the aforementioned base divisions, this setting provides a large space for tactical choices in urban battles. Field battlefield battles are automatically triggered after the two armies collide in the field pathfinding area. This will generate a field battlefield battle collision body at the trigger point. All troops passing through this area will automatically enter the battlefield until the small-scale battle is won. Negative, this field battlefield also includes the fronts of the attacking sides. Normally, each side has a 180-degree back. Will be at a disadvantage in terms of combat values. The combat value algorithm is introduced below. Each army of the two parties involved in the battle has a combat power (ce) value. This value is manually edited during the process of creating an army. Different military types have different upper and lower limits of combat power. In the two combat modes , respectively calculate the sum of the respective combat power of the two armies participating in the battle, and the party with the leading combat power value will have an advantage in the battle damage ratio. In addition, in the urban battle mode, the area on the right side of the defender can provide additional supplies, and the defender can gain Battle damage ratio advantage, this function only takes effect when the area on the right side of the base is not occupied. In the field battle mode, the party forming the encirclement will get the battle damage ratio advantage. In the game, the battle damage ratio (kdr) panel can be clicked on the battlefield See.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n4. Introduction of missile base and anti-missile interception system. When the game reaches level 7, the missile bases of both sides will be unlocked at the same time. This type of base can only be used for air strikes and cannot trigger ground battlefield operations. After the player clicks on the base, he can edit the attack target location in the panel. Launching will consume a certain amount of Fuel and steel resources. Missile damage can only affect the army. It can greatly reduce the combat effectiveness of the troops stationed in the enemy base that is hit, and does not cause damage to the base itself. When the game reaches level 10, the anti-missile interception areas of both sides are unlocked at the same time. This is a military unit for anti-missile air strikes. It does not trigger ground battlefield operations. Each interception area is only responsible for the interception mission of the bases inside the area. , can reduce the hit rate of missiles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n5. The aircraft carrier and its combat methods. When the game reaches level 5, the aircraft carriers of both sides are unlocked in their respective ports. Before using the aircraft carrier, the train station needs to send trains to transport fuel and steel resources to the port. The cities along the two railways can speed up the train speed, especially the trains that need special protection The safety of the base of the station originating station determines whether the train can be used. When the aircraft carrier route is edited and the aircraft carrier departs and lands, you can use the carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft function. This reconnaissance aircraft will fly in the area near the shore to interfere with the interception success rate of the enemy's anti-missile interception system in the area and improve the interception success rate. The hit rate of friendly missiles in this area. You can also send troops to board the aircraft carrier before departure, and use the landing function to land troops when the aircraft carrier docks at sea. The natural enemy of the aircraft carrier is the submarine. Both sides will unlock it at level 12. It needs to consume resources to research and increase the damage. The submarine will inflict continuous damage, reduce the durability of the aircraft carrier, and limit the combat time of the aircraft carrier at sea. Ultimately, when one side breaks through the other side's capital first, victory is declared.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T03:30:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb02da51ddcc026ad161bdee09018827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoreyGameDev"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoreyGameDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
