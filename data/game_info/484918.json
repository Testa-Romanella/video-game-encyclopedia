{"id": 484918, "slug": "love-mystery-club", "name": "Love Mystery Club", "name_original": "Love Mystery Club", "description": "\"You are guilty.\"<br/>Innocent words and behavior changed the trajectory of the future life.<br/>Gentle but sharp-tongued girlfriend, lively and lovely sister, what are they hiding?<br/>Forgotten accidents, horrible legends you are unwilling to face, and dusty memories gradually peeled away and exposed.<br/>As the head of the high school detective club, you need to play reasoning games with them to find the \"sin\" committed before and the truth behind it.<br/><br/>Just like in \"Umineko When They Cry\", the blue words are used for guesses and the red ones for facts. The two colors interwoven like water and fire are also a cage woven by logic. To break through this cage you need wisdom, patience, and love.<br/>Even if you choose the wrong option, it will not lead to game over. It is very suitable for casual players who like love reasoning but don't want to waste their brain cells.<h3>STAFF</h3><ul><li>Scriptwriter: Trinidad Frozen<br/></li><li>Supervisor: dete_lynn<br/></li><li>Morgie CV: A Cun<br/></li><li>Miao Tian CV: Z Jun<br/></li><li>English Translation: Pan Zhen<br/></li><li>Russian Translation: Ilya Smirnov</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T20:02:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5704e5bbd7b99606e7d6301dda3a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pinna Mountain"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pinna Mountain"], "esrb_rating": null}
