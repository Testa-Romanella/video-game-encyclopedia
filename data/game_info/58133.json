{"id": 58133, "slug": "spyro-reignited-trilogy", "name": "Spyro Reignited Trilogy", "name_original": "Spyro Reignited Trilogy", "description": "<p>Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a collection that includes three remastered games from the Spyro franchise that were released in the late 1990s: Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto&#39;s Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of the game is identical to that of the three original games. They all follow Spyro, a small cutesy purple dragon, on his quest to save his dragon kin from various villains.</p>\n<p>The games are set in the Dragon Kingdom, a fantasy world inhabited by sentient dragons. There are five dragon realms that used to co-exist peacefully. In the first game, the villain is Gnasty Gnorc (a gnome/orc half-blood), who magically turned all dragons into crystals. Spyro has to save them and defeat Gnorc. In the sequels, Spyro has to deal with other villains, such as Ripto the warlock, who tries to conquer the world, or Sorceress, who steals the dragons&#39; eggs.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Spyro in a 3D environment from the third person view. Spyro can breathe fire to defeat his enemies. The dragon cannot actually fly, but he can glide long distances. A dragonfly companion named Sparx follows Spyro, helping him to pick up treasures and keep track of his health. To restore his health, Spyro can eat butterflies. The third game, Year of the Dragon, introduces other playable characters that can be unlocked by completing levels.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T14:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a50/a505bccdcfdc79970a93574c747f6e0d.jpg", "website": "https://www.spyrothedragon.com/", "rating": 4.13, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 295, "owned": 2847, "beaten": 288, "toplay": 304, "dropped": 191, "playing": 145}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 284, "ratings_count": 518, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 526, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Activision", "Toys for Bob", "Iron Galaxy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Activision Value Publishing"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
