You can download if you want but you don't have to. We are trying our best to work on the game. The Misses is now the score due to a code error. Its fine though. Its way better than you would think. Also if I were you I would download the game. It shows support. You will also have the rights to add images from Buff Rhythm to Games, Videos, NFTS, and everything else. 2 Collabs/Crossovers have been done. We will do more.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T16:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67c885b65f672dd4b03e311ea392e62c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LilLeader"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
