The former inhabitants of this continent are infected and become something new and have gone far beyond their races. Take control of one of the races and fight in an endless struggle! <h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li> Multiplayer strategy in 1x1 mode;<br/></li><li> Variation of abilities \\ creatures depending on the selected elements during the game;<br/></li><li> Regular content and balance updates;</li></ul><h3>REVIEW</h3>In ElementalsFight, players are divided into two equal teams on opposite sides of the map. The goal of each player is to build as many buildings as possible and produce the creatures and defend their base. Under the control of the players there is a hero who can both build buildings and buy items with unique elements, which improves player creatures and hero`s abilities. Whose hero survives, he won.<h3>GAMEPLAY </h3>ElementalsFight combines both the Tower Defense genre and the MOBA, only instead of towers, players place buildings that produce creatures that go to another team. You will not be able to move buildings and their place for construction is limited, so think about their location in advance.<h3> </h3>Your creatures will walk, attack, use abilities - automatically! After killing enemy creatures, you will receive gold, which you can spend on buying new buildings or items for the hero. Defend your hero at any cost, but if the opponents entered your base, but do not find the hero, they will begin to capture the base, which will lead to their victory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T02:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/21284177332ee458e72b28ce21aa0652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OurLastSpring"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OurLastSpring"], "esrb_rating": null}
