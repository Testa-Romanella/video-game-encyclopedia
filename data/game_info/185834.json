{"id": 185834, "slug": "speedy-booster-alpha-1", "name": "Speedy Booster Alpha 1", "name_original": "Speedy Booster Alpha 1", "description": "<p>I started making a first person shooter\u00a0 in Unity for the purpose of getting more practice with Unity when\u00a0I had this idea. Instead of obstacles or enemies, there are only targets, and when you shoot a target you temporarily move faster. The goal is to hit all the targets as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>There are only 3 levels at the moment (and short levels at that!) I\u00a0have no idea if this will be any fun or not, so I'm publishing this alpha now in case I\u00a0stop caring and don't finish developing this.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind I\u00a0am a programmer, not an artist, and so everything looks pretty bland right now. In future versions of this, the look will probably not change much unless one of my artist friends decides to work on this with me. I will more likely focus on making the mechanics feel better, as well as other quality of life changes, and adding more levels.</p>\n<p>Play with the keyboard and mouse. Left click to shoot. Right click to throw an explosive, or hold right click to throw the explosive farther. Explosives can destroy gray walls and targets. Destroying a target will give you extra speed, but you only need to destroy the red targets to finish the level.</p>\n<p>If you have fun, let me know what your best times are!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7c/b7c44498825a1c9a4ffe6bf2b4b54e0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["xandotoaster"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
