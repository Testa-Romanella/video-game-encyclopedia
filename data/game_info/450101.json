Live the horror from the feudal era's beliefs as the priestess of a temple.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This demo is meant to test the key features of the final game. It is currently on Alpha so we'll develop it further in Ikai. \u00a0Don't forget to add it on your Steam wishlist if you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>The guys from\u00a0@endflamestudio</p>\n\n\n<p>The blood-stained leaves were the first evidence of chaos. The temple's bell screams for help, but it is no longer a sacred place. All Gods have gone, giving way to monsters, ghosts and spirits. You, the perfect priestess, had the onus to protect it, yet did quite the opposite.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t faint now, embrace your weaknesses and pray for surviving in the mayhem you\u2019ve just unleashed. Keep a stiff upper lip, nothing bad will happen if you follow these two rules.</p>\n<ul><li>Write the protective seals on time with brush and ink</li><li>Be silent, under no circumstances should you disturb the evil</li></ul>\n<p>Dare you help get back the Gods and redeem your actions? Experience the terror by the hand of yokais and submerge into the superstitions of the past driven by a unique story and exploration.</p>\n\n\n<p>Endflame is a small team of three indie devs making a Japanese horror game.</p>\n<ul><li>Writing and design - Laura Ripoll</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Art - Iv\u00e1n P\u00e9rez\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Programming -\u00a0Guillem Travila</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Grab the PRESSKIT here<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter -\u00a0@endflamestudio</p>\n<p>Newsletter -\u00a0bit.ly/EndflameNews</p>\n<p>Web page -\u00a0endflame.com/</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing our demo.
