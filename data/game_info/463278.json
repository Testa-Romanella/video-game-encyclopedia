It should work fine in any relatively modern computer, but if you encounter performance issues, I\u2019d like to hear it.<br/></p>\n<p>The demo lacks some things that I want to add to the final game, like more attacks for the players, explosives, acid damage, more enemies...</p>\n<p>The comic panels are done by the great Rafa Mata. Don't hesitate to take a look at his web!</p>\n<p>And if you want to follow more updates of the game, follow me at Twitter.</p>\n<p>I hope you like it, have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T04:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5ce9d3d58b4557dc9fc06ce4c0ce58d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ArsCreativa"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
