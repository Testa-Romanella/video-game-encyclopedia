First he lost his job, then he lost his life, then he lost his job again in the afterlife. Now that he\u2019s gotten up on his feet and landed himself an internship at the prestigious Purgatory - as a grim reaper no less. But let\u2019s not celebrate too early, because he\u2019s lost his scythe first day at the job. These lost souls won\u2019t go reap themselves, so Grimmy must do his job with bare hands. But be careful though! Grimmy\u2019s big on work-life balance, and he simply won\u2019t work overtime. You\u2019ll know what that means.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>### Team:</p>\n<p>- Designer: [WHiTE-SHiRO](https://ldjam.com/users/shiro-white/)</p>\n<p>- Advisor: [ttkedward](https://ldjam.com/users/ttkedward/)</p>\n<p>- Developers: [joe2643](https://ldjam.com/users/joe2643/), [stenyin](https://ldjam.com/users/stenyin), [lolojohn147](https://ldjam.com/users/lolojohn147/)</p>\n<p>- Sound: [yuninstall](https://ldjam.com/users/lincoln-sin)</p>\n<p>- Art: [sivam](https://ldjam.com/users/sivam), [karen-shum](https://ldjam.com/users/karen-shum), [chan](https://ldjam.com/users/chan), [fionamok05](https://ldjam.com/users/fionamok05)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc607fae0cee9492df704f934f035ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joe2643"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
