You are a young knight, living peacefully in your home town. There are no wars, no group of cultists abducting children, no evil tyrants threatening the king's safety, nothing of the sort... So you will only be running errands and doing chores for the local folk, maybe getting to know new places on the way, and if there is time to add the feature, even have a friendly battle, to hone your newly found abilities in sorcery, with the grumpy neighbour to the right on your newly bought home. Embark on your journey and enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Known Issues:</em></strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Pressing any menu button (C, R, Q or I) while any Signpost Message is on screen (even when leaving or entering the screen) triggers a bug that can go from really bothersome to completely game breaking.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><em><strong>Contact Information:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>For any comment, including bug reporting please send a mail to: yet.another.medieval.fantasy.game@gmail.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T11:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e6/6e6c9993e71bb646864e4d3cdb6a3a05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dann Oak"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
