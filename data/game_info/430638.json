However, his relationship with his girlfriend Girl Friend (first name Girl, last name Friend) is going very, very poorly! Should she break up with him, she would splash him, his expensive custom shirt and, most important of all, the Olympic flame that represents the hopes and smiles of children around the globe! Can Torch keep the flame alive? Can Torch keep his love alive? Could I keep major gameplay features alive? All these questions are answered in Torchbearer of Love and Passion!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, it was supposed to be a mix of a runner with a dating sim, like some sort of endless dater. It's not really about dating, and it's not really endless, so it's more of a finite-relationship-simulator. But endless dater sounds cooler, so let's go with that! Also to foreshadow one of the earlier questions, the Ludum Dare deadline ate my sound effects. Ludum Dare deadline would also be a fine name for a dog when you think about it like that, wouldn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows/HTML5:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Return to game title-&gt; Exit game - Escape</li><li>Jump / Advance text - A</li><li>Flap (press repeatedly to jump higher) - A</li><li>Continue - Enter</li><li>Selection - Arrow keys</li><li>Fullscreen (Windows) - CTRL+Return</li><li>Fullscreen (Web) - There's a small button</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls for Dreamcast (and controller):</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Return to game title -&gt; menu -&gt; collection title -&gt; Exit game - A+B+X+Y+START (Standard Dreamcast return to title combo)</li><li>Jump / Advance text - A</li><li>Flap (press repeatedly to jump higher) - A</li><li>Continue - Start</li><li>Selection - D-Pad or analog stick</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Original release date: 20/04/2020</li><li>Source code is on\u00a0<strong>github</strong>:\u00a0http://github.com/CaptainDreamcast/Torchbearer/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dbab9e7d07fb92036b596ae14d19cab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
