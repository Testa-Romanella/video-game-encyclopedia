I saw the theme was Tamagothchi so I thought it would be cool to try to emulate one of those devices. Also, being a part of the YellingFrog Jam... I went with a frog.\u00a0I\u00a0would have liked to have created a song for the background for\u00a0this but I was unable due to time and scope. I had very little to test anything really, I am just hoping that the code works and little bugs present themselves. It is possible that it will take a while for the pet to evolve, but I was not able to test it fully. I will possibly make edits after if there are game-breaking bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T16:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c66c32141e914c6577d1f3a4f60a45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["darcproducts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
