Not including time spent reviewing the evidence before an interrogation begins, detectives now only have one minute to question a suspect and nail the crime on them before they get away scot-free. Think you're up to the challenge? You'll need to make some slapdash, makeshift, or sometimes downright goofy accusations, or you might not finish the interrogations in time.</p>\n\n<p>Tutorial:</p>\n\n<p>When you enter the interrogation room, you have some time before the interrogation starts to review the case evidence. Start by looking down at the evidence with S. Mousing over the evidence will reveal information related to the evidence. Holding alt will allow you to look more closely at the evidence. Use the scroll wheel while holding a piece of evidence to rotate it.<br/></p>\n<p>From the evidence, you can look up at the suspect with W. Begin the case when you're ready, but be warned, you have only 60 seconds to prove the suspect is guilty, or else they get off scot-free. You can prove the suspect is guilty by presenting evidence to disprove specific parts of their alibi. Present evidence by dragging it over to the suspect; make sure you are presenting evidence to the exact part of their story where they tell a lie. Watch the suspect carefully as they tell you their story, they might get visibly nervous while telling you a lie that can be disproven with the evidence before you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T19:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da3e7a019f264cf87ce90bc378eb701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RileyDix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
