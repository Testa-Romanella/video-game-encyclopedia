Craptastic can mean ludicrous, bonkers, outrageous, funny, wacky, far out, and silly. The theme simply implies that the compo was just for a bit of fun, not a serious coding competition. Competitors were welcome to make an excellent game to submit for the compo, or games that contain some humour or silliness to fit more with the theme, but they didn\u2019t have to!</p>\n<p>The competition was limited to 4KB. Yes, any entry submitted could be no more than 4KB when compressed!<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy these wonderful games that were made for the compo. Thanks to all of the competitors and compo prize sponsors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compilation Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Menu code + music: Richard Bayliss<br/>Craptastic logos: Simon Quernhorst<br/>Help + text: Kevin Tilley</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sponsors:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Games List:</strong></p>\n<p>@_fou_lu: Shinobiden Gaiden (Out of compo)<br/>Chris Page: Freaky Fish<br/>Cout: $100 Blox<br/>Cout: I Found A Moon Rock In My Nose<br/>Cout: Plunko<br/>Cout: Roll Roll Roll<br/>Derek: Elevator Eric<br/>Derek: Endless Worlds<br/>Derek: Mind the Mines<br/>Endurion: 4kventure<br/>James: #2 v abc<br/>Geir Straume: Wave Hero<br/>Goerp: Parking Assist Chicken (PAC)<br/>Igmar Coenen: G7000 Racer<br/>Jamie Fuller: Snake-a-Space<br/>Jamie Fuller: Memory Safe<br/>Karol Stasiak: Space Poker<br/>Malcontent: Mach-Tank<br/>Matthew Clarke:\u00a0 Sheeps!<br/>Megastyle: Kalle Kloakk 4k<br/>Megastyle: Trump Tower<br/>Misfit: WTF<br/>Paul Koller: Conga 4096<br/>Pond/Privy Software: Chef Quest<br/>Pond/Privy Software: Dustin'<br/>Raffaele Formato/Federico Sesler: Orbs<br/>Richard Bayliss/Alf Yngve: Rabid Robots 4k<br/>Richard Bayliss/Shaun Pearson: Toxic<br/></p>\n<p>ZIP Archive containing all games available now!<br/></p>\n<p>Official 2018 'Craptastic' disk compilation by Richard Bayliss now available!</p>\n<p>Includes disk image for C64Mini</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/9700a2c63e25a1e5e63d63cd438ba08d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reset64 Magazine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
