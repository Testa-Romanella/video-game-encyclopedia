The game was never released in Japan unlike its predecessor The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy.</p>\n<p>In this game, the player can switch playable characters between both Fred and Barney, and they both have different attacks and abilities; in the original, the only playable character is Fred.</p>\n<p>The Flintstones: The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is believed to have been released exclusively to Blockbuster Video as a rental title. Though despite constantly being cited as such in modern online reviews and websites, no evidence has been found and some have even refuted the claim by saying that the game was sold in regular stores.</p>\n<p>It is one of the rarest games to be released for the console. As of 2017 copies of the game available on eBay and other similar sites usually sell for over $800 USD to as high as $1,500 as of 2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-24T08:48:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12eb2a8ac906c1c16dbd2049aeedcfd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.3, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Taito", "sol"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
