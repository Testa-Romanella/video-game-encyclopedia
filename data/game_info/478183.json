Rewind time to find a good strategy and defeat the vikings!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in one week for the Brackeys game jam. Main inspirations are the Vikings TV series and\u00a0the games ISLANDERS, Kingdom Rush &amp; Bad North. Everything was made by me (including modeling, texturing, animating, coding, etc) except the background music and the water shader.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a bit short because I didn't have time to add any more levels within the time limit.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Middle mouse button to move and zoom camera</p>\n<p>- Right mouse button to rotate camera</p>\n<p>- Left mouse button to click card, click again to place defense</p>\n\n<p>The game has some bugs due to the time constraint, also the camera movement is not limited so you can move the camera all the way to the edge of the water.</p>\n<p>Because of the fog and water effects, this game may run a bit slow on older computers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:03:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/762e49f968bd8ab185b8b8b71bc23877.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codeer"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
