Each player has a sword and a shield, and you choose whether to put those at head, torso, or foot level each round. If your sword hits your opponent's sword or shield, nothing happens. If you strike true, though, it hurts them! If you hit their feet, you do very little damage, but you force them back a step. If you force them back far enough, they'll fall off the edge of the arena!</p><p>Music: Drunken Sailor by Doctor Octoroc from Shamroctoroc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453343332a2516c24be82a62cf5b811d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Aaron Chapin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
