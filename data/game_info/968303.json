You must find and defeat the corrupted creatures spawned from the toxic tar that has recently entered this world from outside pollution.<br/><br/>Goo Keeper is a pure 2D metroidvania, action adventure with tons of unique bosses, hand-crafted worlds and creatures, and tons of awesome abilities.<h3>A Unique World</h3><br/>Goo Keeper is set in Shroomast, a land of Goos and Mushrooms. Goos are slime creatures that are born from mushrooms and mutated into all sorts of beings. The most advanced goos can take humanoid characteristics while some can become fearsome monsters. Goo Town, the starting village, is where Rolly and some other peaceful goos live. While due to pollution, some other goos were corrupted and have taken a more destructive lifestyle.<br/><br/>Being slime by nature, goos can take different shapes and evolve dynamically. This is seen in some or Rolly\u2019s abilities even. One of which makes his hand turn into a giant hammer.<br/><br/><h3>Beautiful hand drawn semi-open world</h3><br/>Goo Keeper offers a hand drawn semi-open world divided in multiple zones. It has multiple ways of progressing forward, where you can tackle bosses and areas in alternate order as well as bypass some altogether. The optional bosses can guard unique abilities or easier paths to another location. There are 9 primary zones within that world to explore.<h3>Dozens of unique Abilities</h3><br/>There are 3 types of abilities. The mandatory abilities which are required to progress through the game. These include wall climbing, the power roll, etc. The optional equipable abilities which serves to customize your play style and improve your power against more powerful foes. These come in two flavors; active and passive.  Finally we have the hidden abilities; these are from combining specific equipable, active or passive, ability into a new alternate version.<br/><br/>All abilities use up energy from the energy meter, which refills automatically on its own. The speed for which it refills however is based on the power of the ability itself. This is a simpler way to manage how often you can re-use abilities, while also given the choice between faster attacks or slower more powerful attacks.<br/><br/><h3>Game Features</h3><ul><li>Classic metroidvania 2D side-scrolling action, with all the modern hand-crafted art style.<br/></li><li>Explore a vast interconnected maze-like land of overgrown castles, forgotten temples and and the deep mushroom underworld.<br/></li><li>Create your own path!
