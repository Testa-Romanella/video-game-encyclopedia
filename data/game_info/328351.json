It's very short and might as well be a flash game but i made this in unity ( the 2017 1.1 version). Hope you enjoy and over my course i will make other games and when i'm done i might join game jams and make a game i wanna create and make by myself. Thank you and may luck be with your side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T03:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dba0734863e2f719d0de9f1bf221f20b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thekingsammy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
