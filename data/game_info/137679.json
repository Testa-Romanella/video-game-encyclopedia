There is only *one level*, but it <br/>keeps changing with each loop.<br/>The crazy part is, every time you beat<br/> the level, the *speed of the game* increases. It gets quite challenging<br/> by loop 5, and incredibly difficulty by loop 8.</p>\n<p>To help out, <br/>there's a powerup called 'Time Pulse', in limited quantity. It slows <br/>down time temporarily, and if you shoot the enemy bullets during this <br/>time, you zap them into cash. And for every so-many bullets you destroy <br/>like this, you get a new Time Pulse! It's good to get you out of a jam, <br/>and man does it get tough later on. <br/>Once you understand the flow of <br/>the loops, you'll know when the best time to spend your Time Pulse, and <br/>you'll start to figure out how to chain them, earn more, to get further.</p>\n<p>-PARKOUR!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bca/bca3c66c2804363ad9171ca2f5a08966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mommy's Best Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
