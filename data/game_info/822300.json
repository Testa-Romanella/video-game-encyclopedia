Controls</p>\n<p>Mouse to navigate.</p>\n<p>While ingame, press left mouse button to the current\u00a0piece (above the field)\u00a0down.\u00a0Pieces can be placed anywhere (including over already placed pieces, except for gray pieces).</p>\n<p>Use the scroll wheel, or X and Z, to rotate your current piece.</p>\n<p>2. Gameplay<br/></p>\n<p>Connect similarly colored pieces from one side to the other to clear them. Clearing pieces gives you power, and power causes you to attack enemies.\u00a0 Larger, branching connections give more power.\u00a0Your goal is to clear all 10 levels without being defeated.<br/>Additionally, clearing pieces gives you XP, which can be used to upgrade your stats in between stages.\u00a0<br/>Some enemies will attack with gray pieces, which cannot be overwritten and will be cleared when pieces are cleared near it.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game is hard.\u00a0It's designed that way. If you can't get past the first few stages, try changing your strategy, or your weapon of choice. Try not to overwrite too many pieces as well.</p>\n<p>3. Story</p>\n<p>There exists a tower, far away from civilization, where a dragon lives. They say that the one who slays the dragon will have their greatest wish granted. Many have tried to climb the tower to no avail.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enter Phoebe, a young girl who wishes to defeat the dragon and have her wish granted.
