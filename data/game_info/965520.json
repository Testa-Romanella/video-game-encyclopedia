An action-packed top-down shooter game with several wide-open maps and a dozen unique (and maybe underqualified) heroes, Hollybound truly has it all!  Unlike in boring real life, in Hollybound you'll face inconvenient traffic, a dangerously crowded shopping mall, and even an Italian restaurant!  ... I promise, it's cooler than it sounds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>THE STORY</strong><br/><br/>On the first night of summer vacation, a party is going down on Holly Lane!  Celebrating their newfound freedom, twelve friends enjoy a night of paintball, soda, and drawing.  When a collective rumble of stomachs rings out, the boys get some ice cream out of the freezer.  Unfortunately, it's rock solid!  Ethan suggests heating up the spoons in the microwave to make it easier to eat, and everyone overlooks the common knowledge that silverware in a microwave is a TERRIBLE idea.  Josh mentions that food is supposed to be wrapped with a paper towel when microwaved, and when nobody can find a napkin, Colin just uses the drawing paper from earlier to wrap up the spoons.  The geniuses set the timer for 10 whole minutes, and the radiation begins to react to the spoons and the drawings they had made.  But before anyone could notice...  <strong>BOOM!!!</strong>  A radioactive explosion bursts through the house!  Escaping the blast, the boys laugh, as explosions are really cool and kind of funny.  But then, the sky flashes an ominous red, as the booming voice of LORD OPPTAVIOUS calls upon his army to invade!  From the flames, creatures that resemble the ones they had drawn rise and begin to terrorize the town, spreading across it by using radioactive portals.  To save Wayfield, and hopefully prevent their parents from finding out they caused the apocalypse, the 12 underqualified heroes grab their paintball guns and prepare to take on the radioactive invasion!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO HOLLYBOUND</strong><br/><br/>THE GOAL: After spawning in a deactivated portal, you must collect the amount of radiation specified in green under the HP display to activate the portal in each map.  When the required amount is reached, an arrow will point you back to the portal to complete the level!<br/><br/>RADIATION: You can collect radiation by finding it scattered across the map, or by defeating enemies.  When an enemy is defeated, you will receive an amount of radiation that directly correlates to the amount of health that the enemy had.<br/><br/>POINTS: You get points for finding radiation, as well as damaging/defeating enemies.  The points you collect will be added to your total score once you complete the level.<br/><br/>SHOPPING: You can use your points to buy upgrades!  The shop is located on the level select screen.<br/><br/>STAMINA WHEEL: The stamina wheel in the top left corner is very important!  When it is full, you can do a special move.  Each special move is different depending on which character you use, so make sure to try them all to find your best fit.  An indicator below the wheel will also notify you when a special move can be performed.  Another indicator to the right of that one will notify you when a dash can be performed.  It only requires the stamina wheel to be half-full, and is useful for crossing busy streets or escaping hordes of enemies!  The stamina wheel is the key to success, so make sure to pay attention to it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>CHARACTERS</strong><br/><br/>JOSH<br/>Health: \u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605<br/>Special: Draws 4 cartoon allies that target and attack enemies.<br/><br/>COLIN<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605<br/>Special: Summons Grody the monkey to attack and knock back enemies.<br/><br/>DAMIAN<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: A fedora orbits around him that damages enemies and spawns other weaker fedoras that target nearby enemies.<br/><br/>ETHAN<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: Summons a pair of scissors that quickly targets and damages enemies.<br/><br/>TEDDY<br/>Health: \u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605<br/>Special: 2 vinyl records orbit around him, and when one hits an enemy, a loud music blast bursts out in a larger radius.<br/><br/>EDWARD<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: A dungeon master screen unfolds at the location of the cursor, and spawns two goblins that attack nearby enemies.<br/><br/>TREY<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605<br/>Special: Throws out a guitar like a boomerang that leaves behind a trail of musical notes that deal damage to enemies.<br/><br/>AIDEN<br/>Health: \u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: Becomes a ball of pure speed that can damage enemies while protecting himself from damage.<br/><br/>JACOB<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: Rolls a die that deals the amount of damage to enemies correlating to the number that is rolled.<br/><br/>KYLE<br/>Health: \u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605<br/>Special: Serves a volleyball that deals damage to enemies, while a small blast appears around him.<br/><br/>SAMMY<br/>Health: \u2605\u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605\u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605<br/>Special: A camera appears at the location of the cursor and makes a flash that damages enemies.<br/><br/>BRADY<br/>Health: \u2605<br/>Speed: \u2605<br/>Attack: \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>Special: Throws a mighty axe like a boomerang that damages enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Wayfield needs your help.
