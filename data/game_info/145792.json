I don't think it is. It's a bit goofy, and suffers from the problems I thought it would. It doesn't really feel any better or more accurate, just different. I have a hard time saying this is the solution for joystick gimballing, but it is pretty novel and reminds me of the Star Wars Trilogy Arcade game. For better <strong>and</strong> worse.</p><p>However, I made this as a proof of concept so that whenever people bring this type of control solution up they can try it for themselves and have an informed opinion of what it actually feels like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/904aa8848b81cc74044011025805410c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Why485"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
