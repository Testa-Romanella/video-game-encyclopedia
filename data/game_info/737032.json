The twist is that you're a Chicken, the chicken is a Terminator Chicken since it doesn't have legs, it has tank tracks. But why? You're getting chased by a dog, not a normal dog, this dog has a jetpack and is there to kill you. How do you defend yourself? Lasers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Based on a true event.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The game is still in development and has bugs. I didn't really think I'd publish this anywhere, especially on the web. Some of the bugs are on the WebGL version for some unknown reason.
