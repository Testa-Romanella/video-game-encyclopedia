Try to rein back your followers and your dreams in order to take on the world and not get your color trampled upon.</p>\n<p>Color of the Revolution is a take on the clicker genre mashed with a decision-based card-game, where you must make quick decision regarding your current endeavour : painting the world! You must be wise and fast at the same time, else the revolution might just slip out of your hand and you will be left in the dust of your aspirations.</p>\r\nControl\r\n<p>The game can be played using the mouse exclusively, but you may find the following quick-access key useful.<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A\u00a0</strong>- open mail</li><li><strong>SPACE</strong> - use brush</li></ul>\n<p>You play the game by clicking (or press <strong>SPACE</strong>)\u00a0the <strong>brush</strong> icon (bottom left)\u00a0used to <strong>paint 1 cm<strong>\u00b2</strong></strong> of your color on the map, but since you envision to take on the world simply clicking at it won't help much.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>But look!
