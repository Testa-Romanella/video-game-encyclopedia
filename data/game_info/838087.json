It is the goat of lust attacking the heavens with its horns, a sign execrated by initiates.&quot;<br />\nYou are a young man and budding photographer. You live an average and moral life, just trying to figure things out in the world until you come into contact with an ancient, otherworldly relic, granting you a powerful set of &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;meta physical&quot; abilities.<br />\nWith these new set of powers, you attempt to go back to your normal life and routine... but that soon proves difficult as giving in to your own lust and greed becomes far too easy when your mind and body is empowered and corrupted by the ancient relics touch.<br />\nLive a double life, as you try to balance multiple growing romances and relationships while protecting yourself from the shadows in the dark, whose aim, yet unknown, could be to take it all away from you.<br />\nPick a side to stand for, be it good, evil or somewhere in the grey. The ramifications of your choices and actions will have a ripple effect across your small town, changing not just your life and relationships, but the whole town and eventually... the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bfba1fec80e426e5712fd3f74d5e016.jpeg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/psychodelusional", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
