Tile Run is a game where you are a box and you have to try to avoid the color red and try to touch the color green. If you win, you get 3 more lives. If you lose, you lose 3 lives in the Live\u00a0Multiplier, which controls how many lives you gain when winning. Pressing Space gives you a console of which you type commands.\u00a0Typing <help> gives you all the commands. To enter each command, press Space. The boss can obliterate you and is gamer-raging! The purple borders prevent one from cheating, &amp; they pop your character. Hint: You need to use the console in order to win Level 3 (the boss level). Try to win!</help></p>\n<p>This was made in the\u00a0Scratch 3 Offline Editor. Scratch 3 is way less advanced than the C# used in Unity, but can still make games (just simple ones).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:58:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e93/e93d7f4b1bb3a54d193e33dd212c5284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pastaOS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
