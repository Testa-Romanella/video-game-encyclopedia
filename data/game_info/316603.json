Thanks for playing, I hope you like it!!</p>\n<p>There's a readme file with all of the controls/console commands/misc info.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong><br/>Swords are a checkpoint.<br/>Enemies drop pride when they die.\u00a0 It's used as currency.<br/>When you die you drop your pride. If you die again without picking it up, it's lost forever.<br/>Ranged weapon reserves refill naturally with your magic pockets, so don't sweat throwin a bunch!<br/>Dodging gives you invincibility frames, but only while the dodge animation is playing!<br/>The deviant's slingshot is used by holding down space to charge your shot. There's a leeway period directly after a shot where you can still control the bomb's orientation.<br/>Some smaller enemies have a chance to dodge your attacks. This chance will decrease and scale with the \"accuracy\" stat, no matter your class.<br/>There are hidden areas, and even a hidden (unfinished) boss fight!<br/>There's a whole bunch of unfinished content/bugs. I also wasn't able to finish the boss fight music in time. Sorry about that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e48a6c6c65b0cebd9b7418ffb24f3044.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["onimu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
