Unfortunately, as the team\u2019s newest member, he is also the member who is least athletic. This becomes quite the issue once Mamarou has to start participating in the dodgeball team\u2019s regular conditioning, which ends up being just as ridiculous as the training he went through before joining. Help Mamarou keep up with the rest of the dodgeball team during their conditioning jogs! Or at least survive long enough to try!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is a sequel to the game DODGE, but playing it isn\u2019t necessary to enjoy/understand this one, and vice-versa.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a personal challenge to myself I wanted to make DASH a game with absolutely zero dialogue, since I have a tendency to over-write whenever I work on a game. I was technically able to complete that goal, but if you end up beating the game and discovering the game\u2019s endless mode you\u2019ll find that didn\u2019t completely stop me from over-writing as usual.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my second completed project in the Unity engine, and the first one which didn\u2019t heavily follow a single series of tutorials. Similarly to the last one, that means that this is more than likely filled to the brim with bugs and balancing issues, so please comment or email me if you have any questions or suggestions!\r\n</p>\n<p>And as always, thank you for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b9c76d68537d5eebae93aac840b32d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
