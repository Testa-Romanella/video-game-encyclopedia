Starting with nothing, players collect materials, craft tools, build bases, defeat animals and enemies to obtain food and new resources, and embark on further adventures, creating a cycle of gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbAuthentic Survival Elements with Game Over<br/>\r\nIn this game, the orthodox survival element of \"losing health when hunger reaches zero\" is implemented. Additionally, the game is designed with a balance that can lead to a quick game over if players let their guard down. The frequency of obtaining food, the rate of decay, and the rate of hunger recovery are set strictly to cater to users seeking a genuine survival experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fb\"Little +\" Action Elements<br/>\r\nWhile some craft survival games have simple combat with enemies, this game aims for \"Little +\" action elements. It incorporates features such as dodge rolls, lock-on functionality, combo attacks, and enhances the action aspect of the gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbOnline Multiplayer Support<br/>\r\nThis game supports online multiplayer, allowing players to enjoy the experience with like-minded friends.
