It\u00a0is a strategy dice game where you play against another player locally. It was inspired by Knucklebones from Cult of the Lamb.</p>\n<p>The goal of Dicebones is to get a higher score than the other player. To achieve this you place dice on a 3x3 grid. Each die adds points depending on its face value multiplied by the number of same face values in the same column. For example two fives in the same column adds up to 20 points.</p>\n<p>However the enemy can hinder you. Should a die with the same face value be placed in the same column on your enemies side, the dice with said face value will get destroyed and their points substracted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T04:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c5cb183e7cdc1589ce5cd87e88abd4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Infinityvy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
