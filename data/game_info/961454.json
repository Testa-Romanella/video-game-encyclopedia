You'll have to jump from vehicle to vehicle in order to grow and maintain your self-acquired-fleet as you pilot them single-handedly through the enemy forces. <br/>It's a unique genre-mix of Platformer, Shootemup, and a bit of Towerdefense. <br/><br/><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Innovative new game concept<br/></li><li>5+ hours of action-heavy gameplay<br/></li><li>tons of different vehicle-types to acquire and use as you see fit<br/></li><li>Bring acquired vehicles to the garage to dismantle them or built new ones, and take them to other missions<br/></li><li>Grow your own personal fleet to lead assaults into the monster realm!<br/></li><li>Defeat big boss-monsters<br/></li><li>Unique scoring system by breakdancing on vehicles</li></ul><br/><h3>Story</h3>You\u2019re part of a small resistance fighting against a tyrant set on world domination. His quest for power has led him to look beyond our world in search of the elusive monster-realm and the power it contains. <br/>He must be stopped before it is too late, but his forces vastly outnumber the resistance's. In a last effort, \"operation Hijack Overdrive\" has been set in motion.<br/>Now all hope rests on your shoulders, as you\u2019ve been trained and equipped to turn the enemies\u2019 numbers against them!<br/><br/><h3>Gameplay</h3>At it's core Hijack Overdrive is a tactical side-scrolling platformer. Staying in 1 vehicle will often mean the death of you, so you\u2019re constantly on the move, stealing different vehicles, creating a small fleet on the fly, all while dodging enemy fire. <br/>Depending on what you decide to do, a vehicle can be an enemy, an ally, a platform, or a shield.<br/>You decide how you want to tackle each situation, but you\u2019ll have to think fast.<br/><br/><h3>Garage</h3>You\u2019re stationed in a base near the front line, from there you will start each mission. <br/>After completing a mission, the vehicles you acquired get added to the garage in your base. <br/>You can use any vehicle from your base to start a mission with, and even summon one when in a pickle. <br/>There\u2019s also a unique challenge for each vehicle type in your garage, so try to collect them all! <br/>Grow your own personal fleet and use them on special missions where you\u2019ll need every last one of them! <br/>You can redo completed missions at any time to get more vehicles in your garage. (and get the ones you missed)<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T03:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bbd8d5e08f2a17ebf740dcea00faf6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meteor Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meteor Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
