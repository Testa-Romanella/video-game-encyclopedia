But in order to get there, he must make his way through the streets and sewers, avoiding the many\u00a0dangers surrounding him.

It's\u00a0based on an older prototype game jam game I made called IAMNOTSORRY. This game is a <em>massive</em> improvement to that prototype. After a few months, I'm happy to bring you Creatures of Shadow!
