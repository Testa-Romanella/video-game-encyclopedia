We will restrict the kind of simulation to one of the common ones used in video games: Gerstner waves. To make things more interesting, couple the fluid simulation with an sphere. The sphere should fall from a height and sink or float depending on its mass.</p>\r\nUsage\r\n<p>Use the GUI to toggle settings.</p>\r\nTechnology\r\n<p>C++ with OpenGL</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Marc Molina - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Joan Ginard - Programmer\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b5b46ebfc4abebf8e8e99060db052f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joan Ginard Mateo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
