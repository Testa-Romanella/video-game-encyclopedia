If you don't mind, please consider submitting your info for my benchmark by looking directly at the three mirrors, and then put your system information (web browser, CPU, Graphics Card, and OS) and your FPS while doing so into a comment. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, and will help me make the asset great!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d77ffdd60a85528103f631b723fc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phygon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
