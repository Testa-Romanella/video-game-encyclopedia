Followed a tutorial but ended up altering it so I could make additions of my own. It's essentially a marble game. You control the marble and win by collecting all of the pickups in the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>WASD/Arrow Keys</strong>Move the ball/marble<strong>Space</strong>Jump\r\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>\n<p>Collect all the gold to win. As a little extra, you can try jumping over the east wall and landing on the platform below for a tiny sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>There is no menu or automatic reset so if you win or fall into the void below, you'll have to refresh the tab.</p>\n<p><strong>_________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p>It's not terribly amazing and extremely basic and boring from a player's perspective but I'm happy enough with it for how long it took for where I'm at with catching up. I'm going to be uploading all the little projects I work on so I'm starting here and not letting myself decide something is too bad to share with friends!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0might add to this to give myself more things to practice and do things like timing players, letting you rotate the stage instead of controlling the marble, adding courses with end goals to reach,\u00a0adding powerups, alternate paths, enemies and so on. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/1047bd47eaa240970c26ed284a009505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sarah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
