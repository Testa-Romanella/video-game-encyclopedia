The game is played by two players on a board of 11x11 squares, one player taking control of the king and twelve defenders, the other taking control of twenty-four attackers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>2. The attackers take the first move.\r\n  </p>\n<p>3. In his turn a player can move a single piece any number of spaces along a row or column; this piece may not jump over nor land on another of either colour.\r\n  </p>\n<p>4. The five marked squares in the centre and corners of the board are special, and only the king may land on them. Other pieces may pass over the central square in the course of their move, as long as they do not land there.\r\n  </p>\n<p>5. A piece other than the king is captured when it is caught between two enemies along a row or column.\r\n  </p>\n<p>6. A piece other than the king may also be captured by surrounding it between and enemy and one of the marked empty squares.\r\n  </p>\n<p>7. The king is captured by surrounding him on all four sides by attackers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>8. The king may also be captured by surrounding him on three sides, if the fourth side is the marked central square.\r\n  </p>\n<p>9. The king wins the game if he reaches one of the corner squares. The attackers win if they capture the king.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bc3dee2e0214e6db98e139bff444ce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomasLongo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
