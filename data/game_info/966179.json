But from what, Mona does not yet know. There are many things about the world Mona has been purposefully kept from knowing. Holed up in her nestroom, she looks out of her window and gazes upon the distant, glittering, twinkling lights of an alluring place which lies near the heart of this unknown world of bugs. Her need for answers grips her hearts tightly, and one night, she decides it\u2019s time to venture out alone, equipped with her trusty steel bat, just in case things get risky.<h3>Smack! Hop! Dash! Talk! </h3>...your way through the outskirts of cyberpunk bug-society to make your way towards the alluring lights of a place far beyond anything you\u2019ve ever had the chance to know.<h3>Fluid Combat and Movement!</h3>Mona\u2019s bat bonks and smacks with an effortless grace and a satisfying crunch, sending the dregs back to their dwellings, wondering why an odd-looking moth has so much bite. Her deftness is owed to her light and spritely form, hop and dash across the unique and diverse landscapes in Mona\u2019s way.<h3>A Rich World Worth Exploring!</h3>Bugs of all kinds find and make homes where they must, from the old residential district to the dreadful badlands to the deep dank sewers. Each environment is detailed and full of bugs to talk to, listen to, and items to uncover. The more you dig into the world, the more it gives!<br/><br/><br/>This free proof of concept was lovingly and passionately crafted by a team of students and served as their academic thesis.
