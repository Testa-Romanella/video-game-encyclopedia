The music is awful, the controls are meh, but this game is still one of my favorites. One time during production I was stuck for over 2 weeks fixing a bug, the entire bug was missing one ;\u00a0 I've never made that issue since.</p>\n\n<p>Give it a shot if you wanna know where I\u00a0came from! This game was finished in 2012 or 2013, don't be too hard!</p>\n\n<p>Here's a really old video of me playing one of the earliest builds of the game, before you could go back to the main menu, and before levels actually had ending triggers. Don't worry in this build there are end level triggers and death triggers etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/49874297<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73a/73a808a9ef4dad07b9f4bd2f6736b191.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndieCritic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
