Build and expand your base, manage your resources and make as much money out of your followers as possible.<br />\nChoose a humorous name for your:<br />\nCult<br />\nLeader<br />\nDivine Being<br />\nHoly Room<br />\nFollowers<br />\nThen decide on:<br />\nA funky symbol for your merch<br />\nA weird uniform to impress the public<br />\nAn imposing hat to make the other cults jealous<br />\nA strange relic to worship and adore<br />\nSet up your cult HQ. Cultists don\u2019t want much but they\u2019ll definitely need to use a toilet at some stage, and beds mean they can indoctrinate with a decent night\u2019s sleep. The Hypno-Chamber will remind followers of what\u2019s really important and the Pool of Revelations will reveal their hidden traits \u2013 maybe they\u2019re a genius, maybe they spend an especially long time on the toilet.<br />\nIf you\u2019re going to progress you\u2019re going to need some wealthy and influential members, preying on the destitute just doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Not everyone wants your cult to succeed though; the Government, journalists and cultists\u2019 family members all seem to hate you?! And that\u2019s to say nothing of the local rival cult.<br />\nWatch out for your leader too \u2013 his ego will get out of check. Looks like you\u2019ll be building a statue to his awesomeness after all.<br />\nWhatever happens, keep making money as you slowly realise the Grand Plan.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-14T09:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c023fd645921bf4fd4819a0fd18fc1.jpg", "website": "https://www.solesurvivorgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 188, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 6, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sole Survivor Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sole Survivor Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
