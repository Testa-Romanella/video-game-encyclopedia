This format is ideal for competitive bouts between <strong> twenty players </strong> spread over 3-4 factions.<br/></li><li> \"<strong> Tactical </strong>\" sessions that take place over multiple days and allow for slower pace of play, a greater immersion in the world, more role-playing, diplomacy and advanced strategies. A <strong> hundred players </strong> compete for <strong> 5 to 10 days </strong> for the domination of the galaxy.<br/></li><li> \"<strong> Legacy </strong>\" sessions that last <strong> between 1 and 3 months </strong> give you even more time to get to know your allies and enemies, develop intricate plans, specialize in strength, diplomacy or cunning, and become your faction\u2019s rising star. <strong> Around 1000 players </strong> can join this huge arena where factions compete for domination of the galaxy.<br/></li><li> Finally, the \"<strong> Prestige</strong>\" sessions that will be similar in format to \"legacy\" sessions, except that they will run on a single server. Such sessions will offer <strong> 1000 players </strong> (partly chosen for their ranking in the game and partly selected at random through a lottery system) the opportunity to collectively write the history of Rising Constellation through their actions. At the end each server session and in consultation with the session\u2019s most influential players, the history of the Rising Constellation universe will be modified and we will see factions regroup, implode or even disappear following the effects of wars, diplomatic negotiations, and betrayals.</li></ul><br/><strong> A game of factions </strong><br/>Victory can only be achieved as a faction (your team) with each member playing an essential role in achieving their faction\u2019s victory goals. <br/>The collaborative aspect of the game offers you and your faction mates the opportunity to collectively define the strategies (economic, diplomatic, cultural, and warlike) that will lead your faction to victory.<br/>Negotiations, political campaigns and acts of betrayal will be carried out within your faction when navigating key milestones such as choosing your faction\u2019s leadership and setting the guiding principles of its diplomatic strategy.<br/><br/><strong> A game of agents </strong><br/>You will have 3 types of agents at your disposal with which to help your faction:<br/><ul><li> The Navarchs: military agents that lead your spaceship fleets and conquer, weaken or colonize star systems. They can also be of great use within your empire to promote production and the construction of fleets.<br/></li><li> The Effaced: powerful assassins and spies that are masters at gaining you insight into your enemy\u2019s ploys and destabilizing them enemy by killing off their agents.<br/></li><li> The Siderians: diplomats and outstanding speakers that rally the people and convert enemy agents to your cause.<br/><br/><strong> Multiple paths to victory </strong><br/>There are several ways to win a game of Rising Constellation:<br/><ul><li> Way of the Conquest: militarily and diplomatically oriented<br/></li><li> Way of the Culture: culturally and militarily oriented<br/></li><li> Way of the Commerce: economically and diplomatically oriented<br/></li><li> Way of  the Shadows: agent oriented<br/></li><li> Way of the Heroes: agent oriented</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T03:50:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9be/9bed53c9248305c4fa188a01a6bfcb5c.jpg", "website": "https://rising-constellation.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 17, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Blackflag Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blackflag Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
