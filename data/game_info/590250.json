Shouldn't be too hard...right?</p>\n<p>UPDATE LOG:<br/></p>\n<p>0.0.2 (Medium sized): Added a short intro thing to show the actual clipping out of reality part. Also added a goal to the end of the maze (which doesn't do anything yet)</p>\n<p>0.0.3 (Medium sized): Added a menu screen that WORKS! Spent so long figuring out why it wouldn't start the game when you hit play, but it works!
