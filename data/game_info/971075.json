Held from 2012 to 2015, it aimed to develop semi-autonomous ground robots that could do \"complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments. The DRC followed the DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge. It began in October 2012 and was to run for about 33 months with three competitions: a Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC) that took place in June 2013; and two live hardware challenges, the DRC Trials in December 2013 and the DRC Finals in June 2015.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T03:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b10a3eb9351c49579c7ac6c4cf5f28ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["hede"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["hede"], "esrb_rating": null}
