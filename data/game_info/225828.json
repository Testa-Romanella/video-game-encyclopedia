There are however multiple settings that you can use to fine-tune the scraping process. For example, converting \", The\" in a filename to \"The \" and ignoring text withing parenthesis and brackets. If no match is found, it will also try replacing any instance of \" - \" in the filename with \": \" automatically.<br/><br/><br/>BOX ART, BACKGROUNDS, THEMING AND MORE<br/>All of the images in ARC Browser, including but not limited to box art and background, can be customized.
