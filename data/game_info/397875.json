The player gets an additional 5 time when they reach the fruit and time will count down normally regardless of speed at slightly slower than real time. If time runs out your score and total time spent playing\u00a0will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Game may have a bug where it skips the title screen when it loads depending on lag.</p>\n<p>The game was made in GameMaker Studio 2 with a single object and no moving parts. This was done as a challenge to myself. The game is actually an array that updates itself every loop, each segment of the snake is actually a positive integer in the array and every non-zero value in the array is decremented by 1 each \"turn\". Where the head currently is is set to the current length of the snake,\u00a0 and each segment has it's color value adjusted to it's value as a percentage of the length to make keeping track of the head easier.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, message me on twitter @overworlddev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6d7ba05b8d965c00663e10be7a318d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Overworld"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
