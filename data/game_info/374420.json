Fly as high as possible and collect as many stars along your way. Stay extra careful and avoid any contact with cave walls and floating stones! Also, keep an eye out for special MegaStars which will grant you extra points and fuel. Each round is randomly generated, so no two runs will be the same.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Easy to play, hard to master</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your lunar lander is controlled using only directional keys (WASD or arrows), so it is easy for any player to start playing but increasing difficulty as you progress will present a great challenge even for the best players.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Get the fuel to keep the thrusters on</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As you navigate the cave, pay attention at your fuel level. If your fuel runs out you will lose control of your lander and will remain at the gravity\u2019s mercy (and in general, gravity is not quite forgiving).\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Unlock 12 achievements</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Besides getting a top score or reaching the greatest altitude, as you play you will be able to unlock 12 achievements, three of which will put your skills and patience to a proper test.\u00a0 \r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Lovely soundtrack</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MoonCave features a beautiful, whimsical soundtrack and sound effects that will lock you in for hours and allow you to relax during an intense game session. \r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Simple yet intense physics-based gameplay</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Endless randomly generated levels</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Hand-drawn visuals</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Whimsical and catchy soundtrack</strong>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a181635acc8c5ccf8ef51456a260ea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aethronic"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
