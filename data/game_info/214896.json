The theme was \"genre without mechanic,\" so\u00a0I created a platformer where you can't move left or right simply by pressing a button. Instead, gameplay is entirely focused around jumping and wall-jumping. You must wall-jump and use objects such as bounce pads and conveyor belts to create horizontal momentum, and only then will you be able to reach the end of a level.\u00a0 I had a lot of fun making this game, and I hope you enjoy playing it! (It's still a little buggy due to time constraints, but pressing R to reset should get you out of a tight spot no-problem.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbc/dbcbecc98913aa9c7cf6d961ed9d7697.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Trenary"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
