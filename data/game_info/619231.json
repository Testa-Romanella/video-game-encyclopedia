At the end of each level, the speed at which the level was ended is carried over to other levels in the form of \"Rifts\", which apply said speed when touched.</p>\n<p>Return to previous levels to get the speed you need to beat the current one(s)!</p>\n<p>Total of 7 levels that all serve a purpose more than once.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Julian Abraham - Programmer and level designer</p>\n<p>Colin Martin - Artist and musician</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9ec5aefe786bd43513e7996efbece18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scrapbox01", "SpeedyChihuahua"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
