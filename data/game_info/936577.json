You can use a bogey to help you track where you have been and it will warn you if the pilot or any debris has drifted near it. You have only so much time to find the pilot, so good luck!</p><p>Developer Comments:</p><p>This game might have a\u00a0bug or two, an example would be that the\u00a0exit button doesn't work. I ended up in a rush with only 15 minutes left when I\u00a0submit. Unity crashed, a couple of times,\u00a0 so I struggled a bit.\u00a0 In all, I spent 8 and a half hours on this game  over 24 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T06:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414263950106166204a62605e9e32c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBrosDev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
