A model of slenderman running is constantly chasing you, and lowers your health bar whenever he interacts with you causing a game over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you pick up all the keys you can go into a cabin which has a two door sequence in which one is right and one leads to death.</p>\n<p>There is also a shooting system where you can shoot at slenderman to delay him from getting too close. Only a limited amount of bullets however.</p>\n<p>It was fun to make :) We'd like to add jumpscares and sound effects in a future version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468385252a714f7128b7dd36c4662605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jbautista5435"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
