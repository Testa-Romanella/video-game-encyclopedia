It's time to strike back.</p>\n<p>Shoot your arms at the docks to send the people flying (your pollution-related mutations have made your body highly reactive with the air). Be careful! The other sea critters are hungry and your arms also serve as a tasty snack.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Left/Right Arrows: movement</em></p>\n<p><em>Down Arrow: dive downward</em></p>\n<p><em>Z: swim upward</em></p>\n<p><em>X: shoot arm</em></p>\n<p>This is my first completed game since probably middle school. The code is a mess, pls don't judge (or do, I'm not in charge of you). At the very least I've found some things I'd like to work on in my next project, but I hope people can get a little enjoyment out of this too!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c365e7191f8e43680b3f0c45b5d966a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sophesque"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
