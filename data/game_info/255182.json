Beautiful colors.\"<br/><br/>Cool game by CancaoDeDeus<br/>\"I love this game! It starts easy but progresses through more complex levels but not at a frustrating pace. I love the fact I can skip levels and then come back if I want to try later. I even started the whole thing over. Excellent.\"<br/><br/>Love this game! by Dee215<br/>\"I am addicted! I have to hide from people when the game updates because I can't be bothered until I clear all the levels.

Also more types of puzzles like this!\"<br/><br/>Excellent game by R.Edd<br/>\"This is one of the few games I have on my iPhone and iPad. A \"quick\" game you can pick up and come back to anytime. The touch interface is excellent, and while the graphics are basic, the game itself is excellent.\"<br/><br/>Really fun!!! by Li3303<br/>\"A great game! Copy the color pattern in the sample circle by turning the rings. There's one black empty space. You push the arc you want to move onto into the empty space then turn the rings to reposition it. It's like one of those number 15 puzzle games only with a circle, arcs and pretty colors.\"<br/><br/>Great game by XterryX<br/>\"Really a great game I didn't think it was hard enough but I was wrong. After the first puzzle it started to drive me nuts I LOVE this game.\"<br/><br/>Arcs Puts New Spin On Puzzling by AppSmile<br/>\"The game truly meets it's goal of becoming a quick and yet immersive puzzle game.

I am on my second run thru the puzzles and I love the simplicity and bright colors.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b084cfa150cbae4425ae62ab43dfe1e3_ylSmv3o.jpg", "website": "http://www.pomegranateapps.com/arcs", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Pomegranate Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Pomegranate Apps"], "esrb_rating": null}
