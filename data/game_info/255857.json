She is the eleven year old daughter of high achieving parents. Her mother, a respected surgeon and father, a psychiatrist. As the first born of two girls, Quintana feels a sense of responsibility to protect her little sister.

Coming from a creative family, Covington's father left him with music in his veins. Covington continues to teach himself to play guitar by watching online videos of his favorite bands.

But with her ginger locks and eyes of blue and spirit to match her dazzling appearance she has no trouble standing out amongst the crowd. Living on the expanse of the farm with her six siblings, she is constantly seeking her next adventure and with a freckle to match each of her escapades, she\u2019s unstoppable.<br/></li><li><strong>Rascal</strong> - Rascal is eleven years old and an only child who\u2019s been misunderstood until he was diagnosed with ADHD. His parents had him join the Scouts when he was seven, and as his name suggests he has a tendency to create mischief between his peers.
