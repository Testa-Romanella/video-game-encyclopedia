But more and more studies raise doubts about this thesis. Scientists found indications for ancient egypt being far more technologized than we can imagine. Hourglass is set in a scenario in which those assumptions are actually true..</p>\n<p>Besides offering an ancient world to explore, Hourglass is mostly about solving various puzzles with a unique core-mechanic. Your ability allows you to record your actings for a certain amount of time. After that, time winds back to the beginning of the recording and a time-clone of yourself appears, repeating the actions.</p>\n<p>On your adventure, you will have to use this ability in creative ways to get through various areas filled with difficult puzzles.</p>\n<p>Your journey leads you to a remote temple where you encounter undiscovered egyptian technologies and portals to a foreign world. Only by unraveling the secrets of these long lost technologies, you are able to solve all puzzles on your quest and eventually find your father.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-24T04:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e480b2cf1f3fb7d4e075584b2b35bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 21, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberWave"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cyberwave"], "esrb_rating": null}
