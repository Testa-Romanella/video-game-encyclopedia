Well, we gave ourselves two months in total, but we didn`t work full-time on it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game is completely made in <strong>Unity</strong>. The goal for us was to train our C-Sharp-skills, aswell as practicing 3D-modelling, animating and using many other industry-standard tools such as substance painter. In the end we couldn`t do 100 % ourselves, which is why we downloaded sounds, the VR-SDK`s and two skyboxes from the asset store. There would be still a lot of work to do in terms of getting it bug-free and polishing, but we went on to finish studying. In the end the goal of learning a lot and getting a glimpse into the gaming-industry was fulfilled for us.</p>\n\n<p>The game consists of a simple <strong>main-menue-scene</strong>, of which you can load <strong>two different levels</strong>. The goal is to kill all incoming enemies (preferably with style!).</p>\n<p>You can download the project as a whole. Under\u00a0...\\VR-Game\\Assets\\Scenes you can find the different scenes to start the game. We recommend using only the HTC Vive, as there is no support for other VR-devices (yet?!). Make sure to turn on your controllers &amp; hmd, before starting the game.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and feel free to leave a comment! &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Mathias Bauer</p>\n<p>mathias.bauer@live.de</p>\n<p>\u00a0and\u00a0</p>\n<p>Merih T\u00fcrkoglu<br/></p>\n<p>merihtuerkoglu@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T03:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf0/bf0579b23db0119e5596fd04c357701c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Barlium"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
