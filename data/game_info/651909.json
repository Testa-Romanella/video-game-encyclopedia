I'm glad you asked!<br/>After eating a digit, a timer of 1 second is activated.<br/>When eating any other digit, it adds to a chain of all the digits he ate.<br/>When the timer is off, the chain (of the digits he ate) will be added to his score!<strong><br/>For Example</strong>: If pacmanx10 eats \"1\", then \"0\", then \"0\", and then eats nothing for a whole second - the score will rise by 4, because 100 in binary is 4!<br/>NOTE - the\u00a0 chain is limited to 16 digits, therefore 2^16 - 1 is the highest score that can be achieved at once!</p>\n<p>The rest of the rules are simple as the original; you move with the arrows, must eat all the dots / binary digits, and must avoid contact with the ghosts - unless you eat a powerup that allows you to eat ghosts!</p>\n<p>The menu is controlled using the mouse.<br/>The game has 2 modes:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Classic\", where you play as the original Pacman</li><li>\"Modern\", where you play as Pacmanx10 with the gameplay twist.</li></ul>\n<p>The first 5 levels are tutorial levels, you can skip them in the menu.<br/>Also, you can press \"p\" anytime in the game in order to pause (and resume).</p><strong>\n</strong><p><strong>Best played with volume up, lots of emphasis on fun sound effects!</strong><br/>The game is over when you lose 3 lives.<br/>Good luck!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32ec2f4d78f3512c177e1ce8ed347117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yonisimian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
