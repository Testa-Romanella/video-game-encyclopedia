Do you think that's easy? Well, you will change your mind when you get into the world of fast moving trucks, cars, buses, and trains. The city policemen are too busy and need you to help them keep the city streets safe. It is not easy as it seems to control traffic on your own, because you will have to concentrate and pay attention to every single detail. Your main goal is to manage all the vehicles in the city and avoid crashes. You have to tap on the car when you need to stop it in order to avoid collisions. When the vehicle is stopped, you can make it move by tapping again. Sometimes, you will have to control more than one car at the same time. <br/><br/>The highest score you reach, the better place you will earn at the leader's board. The first level is the easiest, and it is designed to help you get the idea of what you should do and how to control the cars. When you reach the next level, you will realize that things are getting more complicated. There are more crossroads, much more vehicles on the streets and sometimes you will have to pay attention to the railway and fast-moving trains. You cannot stop the train, and that is very important to remember. So, when the car gets closer to the railway, make sure that you tap it on time to stop and avoid a collision. The emergency vehicles cannot be stopped either. The sound of it will help you to notice them before it is too late. <br/><br/>This addictive and challenging game will exceed your expectations.
