The completed halls (where the requests come-up), will now be unlocked for the rest of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, the festival now starts and your goal will be to complete as much \"real-time\" request as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game features an increasing level difficulty, allowing all players to reach their full potential, and to be challenged as it gets harder.</p>\n<p>Based around a simple drag-and-drop feature, the game is easily learnable, and it's mechanics are easy to get a grab on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turn your sound on, get ready, and try to make as much points as possible !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T15:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b755faa5cf61789325ec350efbadcf45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mateo_Langlois"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
