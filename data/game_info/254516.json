So far I\u00a0have the following systems working:</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Mode</strong>: Using the Scroll Wheel you can change the 'Mode' controlling how\u00a0mouse clicks\u00a0operate. The mouse mode will toggle from 'Travel' modes to\u00a0 'Interact' modes when you mouse over an object that can be interacted with.</p>\n<ul><li>Walk Mode - Clicking on the screen will have your character walk slowly to a new location.</li><li>Run Mode - Clicking on the screen will have your character run to a new location.</li><li>Inspect Mode - Clicking an object on the screen will do an 'Inspect' action. In the final game this would usually be a voice/text describing the object.</li><li>Grab Mode - Clicking an object on the screen will pick up the object and add it to your inventory.</li><li>Use Mode - Clicking an object on the screen will 'Use' the object. Different objects will have different uses; for this example 'Sit in the Chair' (<em>Sitting not implemented yet</em>)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tracking Cameras</strong>: Moving around the scene the players character may go out of range of a camera or may be obscured by an obstacle. The tracking cameras try their best to find a good camera to view the players character from.</p>\n<p><strong>Inventory</strong>: A scroll-able inventory bar is displayed on the bottom of the screen if the player has picked up at least one object. The right mouse button can be used to scroll if 6 or more items are in the players inventory. (<em>Inventory items cannot be used in any way as of yet.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Near term things that will be worked on next.</p>\n<ol><li>Usable Inventory Items:\u00a0Use, Drop, Inspect.</li><li>Additional Items.</li><li>Heavy Objects: Objects that may be moved, but not picked up.</li><li>Interacting Object: 2 or more objects that interact to make a new object or do something unique.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/7565860e0cf3c6cb777ad0ba570fcc32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reflection Rip"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
