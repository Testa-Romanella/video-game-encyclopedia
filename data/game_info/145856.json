You must reassemble the pieces by pushing them back into the same 3D space. Each plane limits movement to two directions corresponding to the plane (e.g., you can only move in the X and Y directions on the Z plane). Merging an X and Z plane object will create an object that lives on both X and Z planes. Merge that with a Y object to return the piece to its rightful position.</p><p>Art from the MagicaVoxel distribution assets.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/025e669a6f91c97f35dac84e92cef67f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bellicapax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
