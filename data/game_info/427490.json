For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.<br />\nUnshackled traversal -  Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.<br />\nPrequel story set in The Messenger\u2019s universe - Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you\u2019d expect from a Sabotage production.<br />\nFull-on dynamic lighting - Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.<br />\nThe Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre - Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and timesinks.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2023-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T18:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1de/1de8ff69ed31d7a47d4f7770f23f20b8.jpg", "website": "https://seaofstarsgame.co", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 77, "owned": 139, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 261, "dropped": 36, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 72, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Sabotage Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
