Ernesto is believed to be the reincarnated soul of Mildred's late husband, also named Ernesto. With all suspects locked in Catnip Manor it's up to you, Private Investigator Liam Davies, to solve the case.</em></p>\n<p>You should be able to beat this game within 10 minutes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is my second attempt at making a game. Even though the game isn't polished or fully finished by any means, I did learn a lot of new stuff. While the story still is mostly linear\u00a0there now are \"Game Over\" screens to be reached. I've also added a 3D game board so that it's more clear it's a game made in Smile Game Builder.</p>\n<p>I've always struggled with deadlines so expect lot's of typo's as I\u00a0didn't have enough time to check for any spelling mistakes. I did however play through the game\u00a0from start to finish without any hiccups so you should be able to reach the ending(s). I've added a walkthrough at the bottom of this page.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Royalty Free Music from Bensound.com</li><li>Illustrations and story by me. :)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Any resemblance to real persons or other real-life entities is purely coincidental.
