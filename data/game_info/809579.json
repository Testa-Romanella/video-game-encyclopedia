The game has two separate stories, each with their own story, cast, enemies and path through the world of Vassya.\u00a0<br/>Each of the two stories include around 15 hours of story and gameplay and at least another 5+ hours of optional content if you choose to continue on. There is a ton of content to find in each story line, and much of it works to expand on the story and the world. The story is heavy, so admittedly, there is a lot of reading, but I believe it is worth it. Every inch of Vassya is created with a purpose, and hides interesting treasures and bits of lore.<br/>Thanks for checking out my game, and I hope you all enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of Features</strong><br/>- Two separate storylines, each with ~15+ hours of story and gameplay.<br/>- On-screen enemies.
