Well actually he's a skeleton! He had to repo Razor's car AGAIN but that nasty jerk Razor stole Reggie's body, and now Reggie needs YOU, the\u00a0 human, to help him defeat Razor and get his body back! This demo contains 2 levels to get a feel for the game. If you wanna make music for this game, contact me on social media. I have a main menu theme coming, but I'm awful with music! Also if the mask-dogs knock you back, just give them a bone, they'll be good boys.\u00a0Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f4d4b59f7f9e77ad806a8b789dd37f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Melting Brain Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
