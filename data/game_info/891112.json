Skipping does not award any points.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once the time limit has been reached, the amount of words guessed are added as points to the respective team.\r\n</p>\n<p>A new team is chosen and then repeats this process.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each time the same team is chosen, a different player must become the clue giver until everyone receives a chance.\r\n</p>\n<p>After a set number of rounds, the game ends and the team with the most points wins.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T16:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/57851d4df62314124371fac67b33461a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
