Even worse is when a nine-foot-tall rusty statue is on the hunt for you.</p>\n<p>In SFU Wintertide, a game inspired by original Playstation graphics, you're tasked with finding a way to the nearest Evo car in order to leave the mountain before it's too late. Turning up your volume and managing your flashlight usage should be considered to avoid the statue and\u00a0remain hidden.</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: The statue in this game is not inspired by any real sculptures at SFU or anywhere else. While the game draws inspiration from SFU, it is entirely fictional.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119acd3a6dc65951d49c495216ae60de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorCrawfish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
