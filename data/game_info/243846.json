Clear the marbles by making groups of the same color. Groups of three or more marbles of the same color will fall down. If the marbles cross the glowing line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>Simply tap a marble on the game board, or an empty spot close to it, to fire a marble towards that spot. To fine tune your shot, slide your finger left and right anywhere on the screen to first set the direction, then release your finger to launch the marble. <br/><br/>Please support us by rating and reviewing the game. <br/><br/>Game On! :)<br/><br/>Follow us on Facebook:<br/>http://www.facebook.com/GameOnArcade<br/><br/>Developed and published by GameOn<br/>http://www.GameOnArcade.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b81656d930ef48afb151a813d0d901cf.jpg", "website": "https://www.GameOnArcade.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GOES International"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["GOES International"], "esrb_rating": null}
