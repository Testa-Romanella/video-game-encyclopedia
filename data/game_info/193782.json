Though it is only a prototype. I do not plan to work on this project and turn it into a complete game. </p><p>This is a game where you roll a cube left and right, dodging the never ending falling cubes that will kill you if you touch them. When a cube hits the ground a piece of gold drops. Pick it up and you get 1 point. Try to get the highest score you can! </p><p>The game has 3 difficulties. Easy, medium, and hard. But I would recommend to only play medium. As, easy is a little too easy and hard is \"unfair\" with no real mechanics in the game that allows you to dodge tricky situations. Also the highscores are shared though the 3 difficulties.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f147b7bbe6b7a16e2856de7c386c608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greenspotj"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
