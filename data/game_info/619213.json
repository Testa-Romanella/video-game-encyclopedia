{"id": 619213, "slug": "appending-tiles", "name": "Appending Tiles", "name_original": "Appending Tiles", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Each level consists of numbered tiles, each with one of three colors. Your goal is to combine them in such a way that it produces your goal tile for that level. Combining tiles adds their numbers together and potentially changes their color, so you'll have to think ahead before you start randomly adding tiles together!</p>\n<p>The game is a relaxing brainteaser that\u00a0can be played with just a mouse. It's perfect for if you want to challenge yourself a little bit and aren't afraid of\u00a0some mental arithmetic. It features a total of 40 levels of increasing difficulty and complexity, to keep you entertained and challenged for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made entirely in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam of 2021, with the theme \"Joined Together\" by me, WittyAdrian. The music that is featured was produced by Antti Luode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b5f7c28ee52b35c6c55f7511582c37b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WittyWare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
