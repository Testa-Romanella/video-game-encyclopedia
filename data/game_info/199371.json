Unlock new commanders / comrades thru play as well; each one features differing abilities and some unique features!<br/><br/>Supports controllers as well, with optional 2players-1controller mode! Rebind keys in game if your default configuration doesn't work - never be without a working controller!\r\n\n\n<p>Current demo release: Alpha .475 Gameplay Demo Feedback Test: Big Cards, Big Missiles, I Love it!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Alpha Release notes:</p>\n<p>New in .476</p>\n<p>Heavy Missiles stay a bit longer, and stay damage is implemented for those nagging cluster bombs.</p>\n<p>Cluster bombs also got some slight tweaks.<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs and Issues: FINV; = fixed in next version, not yet released</p>\n<p>Title screen - starting the game is a bit confusing [streamlining start and mini tutorial incoming]<br/></p>\n<p>Cities are sometimes invisible when near death due to terrain [fix will be done with terrain modifications when start to make better terrain]<br/></p>\n<p>Cant remap keyboard controls.<br/></p>\n<p>Various inconsistencies in card prices with displayed cost on card. [will fix thru card templater later as card looks evolve]<br/></p>\n<p>Sometimes when you click controls on the titlescreen, the titlescreen locks without controls ever coming up [looking for this now as I go]<br/></p>\n<p>My controller doesnt detect!: push a button on the controller while the game is active. If that doesnt work, try unplugging and plugging it back in. WebGL Unity is a little picky sometimes.<br/></p>\n<p>Cursor duplication: see mouse and game cursor at same time -&gt; try clicking in and out and changing tabs, havent figured out how to get this working every time yet.<br/></p>\n<p>Defense turret invulnerable: havent hooked up death of this yet, consider it easy mode.\u00a0 [working thru some logic now on consequences for turret destruction]<br/></p>\n<p>The quit, it\u00a0 does nothing: WebGL needs replacement UI for various quit buttons since they will do nothing in WebGL mode.<br/></p>\n<p>Controller profiles dont save properly so they need to be reset every time.</p>\n<p>Profiles themselves cant be created, only default profiles are used.<br/></p>\n<p>GUI bug where when you\u00a0 highlight something it stays highlighted, this is due to the GUI Manager needing an ID bugfix for varying button counts: multiple highlight info was disabled as an emergency bugfix. [current fix target]<br/></p>\n<p>Limited selection of default configurations at this time, please post your configurations in comments for expedited support.</p>\n<p>No 1 handed player mode even though 2p1c is supported: need to setup and make UI for this. Also no 2p1c for vs on controllers yet.</p>\n<p>No picking of player cursors in titlescreen: need to add UI for this.<br/></p>\n<p>Theres no way to add new cards to the deck without buying them yet, needs to be a method to get random card unlocks by themselves straight to the deck.</p>\n\n<p>Fixes from .475</p>\n<p>Made the heavy explosions stay around for slightly longer (and also implemented stay-damage so they are more effective)</p>\n<p>Fixed critical crash error from junk cards staying on 2nd new arcade game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Made bearnoff not fly up from his own roars.\r\n</p>\n<p>Slightly reduced the invulnerability frames on cluster bomblets\r\n</p>\n<p>Made sure cluster bomblets deployed on each death.\r\n</p>\n<p>Tweaked wave creation to favor targeting cities more and more as escalation and rounds tick by/up</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e0974a8de454bde94b40daacfb7552dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Golden Shovel Games", "Ikkir"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
