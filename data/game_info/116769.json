Exit tiles are black holes on terrain.<br/>Your air is your health, it slowly runs out. Replenish it at air pockets! If you run out of air you enter into drowning mode, you must make it to the surface to continue.<br/>Use the Detector to find items. Bring items back to the boat to do crafting and level up!<br/>You can dig with some items, like the Spear. Some blocks require better diggers. You can even dig to create exits from buildings!<br/>You will swim in water and fall in air.<br/>Items can grant positive or negative bouyancy. Neutral bouyancy is easiest to control...<br/>At your boat you can craft combinations of items to make new ones. You need to find and bring back 'loot' to allow this.<br/>Some combinations of items works much better than others!<br/>The deeper you go, the most monsters, and the more goodies you'll find.</p><p>Beware: in the deepest depths Cthulhu fatgn....<br/>Kill Him To Win.</p><p>KNOWN ISSUES:<br/>- If you are moved around too quickly (e.g. shoved by multiple of the blue type of fish, or try to go up too fast while under the influence of extreme bouyancy) the game might softlock. It's difficult to reproduce this, so try to avoid it???</p><p>Devlog:</p><p>http://forums.roguetemple.com/index.php?topic=4915...</p><p>Video:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b795d7df1d981ccccef5506de4bfc21f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fangz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
