To progress through the game, the player must control Turok through a series of levels while wiping out a large number of enemies using different types of weaponry. Some levels have keys that the player need to find to access locked areas and progress further through that level, while others require the player to control a vehicle and destroy structures. The game employs a password system to prevent the loss of progress. Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it features a different storyline. The story follows Turok as he aids peaceful Dinosoids to stop a rebel Dinosoid sect from reawakening an ages-old war.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/456/456ed0de393dea6c549292c047e19055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Bit Managers"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
