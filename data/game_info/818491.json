You can only play the second level if you want to play it (if it works correctly for you). We apologize, a fixed version will come out at the end of the rating period.</p><p>Team Pear</p><p>Mimic Manor is a projet we made during 2022 Game Maker's Toolkit's game jam. The theme was roll of the dice so we decided that instead of the player rolling the dice it would be the enemies. When the player does an action, the enemies mimic it and add it to the pool of actions possible (max of 6). When it's their turn to play they throw a D6 containing the actions available to them and act accordingly to what they rolled. The player has to defeat them using this feature as an advantage to go further and further into the manor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e95890db6ac7962297ad3b6d9ca7959d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Climbing Dolphin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
