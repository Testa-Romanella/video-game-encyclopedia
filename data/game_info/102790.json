{"id": 102790, "slug": "chronicles-and-fables-arena", "name": "Chronicles and Fables: ARENA", "name_original": "Chronicles and Fables: ARENA", "description": "<p>The special Action RPG game where are no heroes and worlds to save, no sandboxes or just corridor story. Its an untypical role-playing story-adventure in the culture-oriented cold-blooded setting that has an emphasis on non-hardcore&amp;still fun realism and has multiple strange but original endings during all story through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, the graphics are old school like but each location was custom pictured, with enthusiasm and for some of us this graphics' style is actually the point. We also know that the controls are a bit unexpected, but they are really comforted when you used to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now the last but not the least, if you know how common RPG Maker game mostly looks like - this is the list of ARENA's features and each of them could be that \"because\" you are searching for:\r\n<br/>1. Action fighting system. Scrolls, range' and melee' weapon types included.\r\n<br/>2. Hunger-thirst-rest system. It cares that you don't think your character is a biorobot.\r\n<br/>3. Kind of open world. Locations here as well as its inhabitants are part of the setting and you are the only one who can make them part of the story. So walk freely, there is gameplay besides the story.\r\n<br/>4. Crafting system. Its Gothic like and comprises food and weapon crafting.\r\n<br/>5. Multiple story endings. According to the game designer, you have the main character's purpose and the obvious way to achieve it. Like you usually do. But this time you are the mind controller here, so who says the story must end one way? Studio's game designer envisaged it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab9e2402649b7d1df0e213d3c5ccf706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamuelsAttic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
