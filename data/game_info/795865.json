One player's rules might conflict \u2014 or outright contradict \u2014 those of another player, forming a complex web of bodies and connections.</p>\n<p>To resolve conflicts, players will need to bend some rules to accommodate others: finding loopholes and cheats wherever possible.</p>\n<p>To begin, each player reveals their first rule and chooses another player for it to apply to. This rule establishes where players will be positioned in relation to each other. For example:\u00a0</p>\r\nYou stand beside one person\u00a0\r\n<p>Next, each player reveals their second rule and chooses a different player. This rule describes a physical connection or interaction. Something like:</p>\r\nYou hold hands with a different person\r\n<p>Finally, each player reveals their last rule. Unlike the first two rules, the third rule only applies to your own body, specifying an individual requirement that will complicate the resolution of the first two rules. This could be:</p>\r\nYou sit on the floor\r\n<p>When everyone's three rules have been successfully accommodated, the puzzle is solved and everyone wins.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Triangulate was made by dancing in collaboration with Lee Osmond and Paul Jackson.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T08:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/9263e9c4c6b966db2f5bd5ab33605e44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["milkymilkface"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
