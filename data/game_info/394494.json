This is actually a school project, but I wanted to see if this could actually be something more than just a school project. I'd love to get some actual feedback and I'd like to know how you think the game should go forward, any fixes or add-ons that would make the game better.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I have a lot of ideas for this game, I'll just need to figure out how to execute those ideas.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I try to update bugs and some fixes every week.</strong></p>\n<p>The full game is estimated to release early 2020 and the pricing will probably be around 5$.<br/></p>\n\n<p>HEY!</p>\n<p>Would you be interested in testing the game and filling a short form while testing the game. Testers of all kind needed. Testers that give feedback get the full game for free when it's finished.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. sorry about not having any controller tutorial, I'll try and fix one real quick.</p>\n<p>P.P.S. I'll be making a full asset list whit the full game release, but if you like to know about some assets, i can link the to you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1197de49ae5c0a593577c71476aa28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Misaki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
