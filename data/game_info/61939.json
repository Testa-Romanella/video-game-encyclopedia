You become exhausted, weak, helpless... until your good buddy \"Boat\" arrives to re-supply your energy storage level! Determined, you move forward to push back the evil once and for all. A great quest lies ahead of you Road Warrior. Your determination and skill will be put to the test, as you fight against great beings of doom with powerful tricks. Save the world, defeat the Four Horsemen, charge!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame lasts for around 2-4 hours, or 45-60 mins if you beat it first try... however you need to be good as HECK in order to do that!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/761/761e6bd2c1c098cf0fd28022ad07206c.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/RoadDoom/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Agelvik"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Agelvik"], "esrb_rating": null}
