{"id": 28580, "slug": "dragon-age-2", "name": "Dragon Age 2", "name_original": "Dragon Age 2", "description": "<p>Dragon Age II is the second part of the Dragon Age series of dark fantasy games. The series is inspired by the classic Bioware RPGs like Baldur&#39;s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, and some of the game\u2019s writers have previously worked on these titles.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Dragon Age II is set in the medieval world of Thedas, inhabited by mythological races like elves and dwarves. This high fantasy setting has a definitive &quot;Dark Ages&quot; atmosphere. The game continues the plot of Dragon Age: Origins, and the player can choose which ending of the original game to use as a backstory. The player assumes the role of a protagonist named Hawke. He or she is a human who had to flee from an invasion of the monsters called Darkspawns. Over the course of the game, Hawke eventually rises to power and influences the fate of the whole Thedas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main protagonist is fully customizable. The player can choose his or her first name, gender, appearance and character class. There are three classes available: mage, warrior, and rogue. The player controls not only Hawke but also his or her party that can include up to three companions at once. You can only control one character at a time, however, switching between them while leaving the rest to AI control. </p>\n<p>Dragon Age II introduced the dialogue wheel that was borrowed from the Mass Effect series. Dialogue options usually have a tone that defines how other characters perceive each line and, eventually, the protagonist&#39;s personality.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2011-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:13:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/974/974d08635981db7677630327ce1fe4bb.jpg", "website": "http://dragonage.bioware.com/da2/", "rating": 3.84, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 140, "owned": 1518, "beaten": 872, "toplay": 111, "dropped": 140, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 802, "suggestions_count": 615, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 816, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["BioWare"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
