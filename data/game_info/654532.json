I learnt how to utilise Blueprints with Unreal Engine 4 as well as some important concepts. I\u2019ve attempted to structure this game in a way that allows me who has never used UE4 to follow along and learn to navigate the interface as I progressed throughout the game. I started from an empty project and cover aspects including some of the ways I can import and adapt assets such as models and textures, techniques to pull content from other UE4 projects and how to implement audio and particle effects to my game. Learn simple - intermediate uses of Blueprints. Develop an understanding of some preferred game development pipelines. Build a polished prototype to flesh out into a full game. Learn to navigate the UE4 interface with hands-on experience. An introduction to particle systems. Applying Audio to a game. Creating my own Game Mode to manage the game logic. Programming a player-controlled character. Programming of different enemies and projectile types. Programming a simple boss. A dynamic wave spawning system. The use of inheritance to help streamline development. Simple art concepts. Importing content into the game from various sources. Learn to use source control. Implement a save / load system.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71fc1dc26fbeea0103abce68347affff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
