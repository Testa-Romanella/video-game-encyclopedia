But you are no hero. Hunters only work for coin and are rarely welcome anywhere. <strong>Their secret occult techniques</strong> allow them to absorb monster abilities and so they are feared and hated by most of their customers, who see them as degenerated abominations. Only the steady demand of Sigurds <strong>proficient skills in combat and magical-annihilation</strong> stands between him and the ever daunting threat of becoming an outlaw.<br/><br/>Accompanied by his apprentice Lilly, a young , very talented and sometimes rather cocky, Hunter aspirant, they travel into the haunted Blackswamp to save the\u00a0dwellers of the village Usdir\u00a0from an ancient evil...<br/>and <em>empty their pockets</em>.<br/><br/><strong>The Hunter of Falkenberg\u00a0</strong>was developed to comply to the technical limitations of the retro gaming console <strong>XBOX.<br/><br/></strong><strong>SLEIPNIR DREAMWARE</strong> is a newly formed indie studio from Germany.
