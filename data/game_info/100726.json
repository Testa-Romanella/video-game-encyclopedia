An excellently written, grim and intriguingly illustrated choose-your-own-adventure where choices matter and the remnants of humanity struggle to preserve their humanity; or, traditionally, get richer in expense of the many.</strong><strong>\" </strong>--IndieGames.com</p><p><strong>\"Being able to guide her through this world, to shape her as a different person in every playthrough, gives <em>The Right Side of Town</em>a power that traditional fiction can't touch. I love a good novel, but this game showed me just what video games can bring to traditional storytelling through the reader. <em>The Right Side of Town</em>gives the reader agency in the storyline, and a power over where it goes, that you just don't see in other forms of entertainment. That it can do so with subtlety just shows the skill Gwaltney has as a writer. Adding Kitty Horrorshow's wonderful poetry into the mix, as well as Huipe's music, creates a delightful experience that is over far too soon.</strong><strong>\" </strong>IndieGames.com (review)</p><p><strong>\"</strong><strong>The Right Side of Town sees humanity long after fleeing a dying Earth, fragmented into colonies where the rich get rich and oh, you know the rest of how that works. Pretending to be human for 483 years, Naomi has for now settled into a life as a cop and a mother in a corner of the solar system. Then murders start. Then the murders get personal. It's exciting, with options hinting at things going far worse than I let happen in my first attempt. It's touching and hopeful and sad too.\" </strong>-- Rock, Paper, Shotgun</p><p>\"<strong>With five endings across forty-thousand words, there is lots of room for players to accidentally bring doom upon humanity through poor detective work and decision-making. Written/developed by Javy Gwaltney (</strong><strong>The Terror Aboard the Speedwell</strong><strong>) and Kitty Horrorshow (</strong><strong>Dust City</strong><strong>), [<em>The Right Side of Town</em>] promises a winding narrative filled with dark themes</strong>\" -- Indie Game Mag</p><p>\"<strong>My first play took me about twenty minutes, and I was utterly engrossed. I'll definitely be playing again to see what other endings I can find \u2013 the possibilities for branching seem like the story could end in vastly different places. The illustrations are excellent; Twine games are typically text-based, but for this one, there are illustrations at important plot points. The soundtrack (included as both wav files and in a YouTube link at the beginning of the game) sets the mood perfectly. This is definitely dystopian cyberpunk with all the trappings: huge class divides, androids, somewhere in the middle of present day and an unrecognizable future. The story is tense and kept me clicking, worried that my next move would be my last.</strong>\" -- <em>NerdybutFlirty</em></p><p><em>The Right Side of Town </em>was written by Javy Gwaltney and Kitty Horrowshow.
