The goal is simple, get to the goal. Along the way, you will\u00a0have to press switches to remove walls and overcome a few other obstacles.</p><p>The concept of this prototype is based on an old flash game I made back in my high school years. It was pretty fun, so I think I'm going to take a go at making a full game of it.</p><p>That said, I do need some feedback, so I decided to upload the game's prototype here for just that.</p><p>Available here are both the android and PC versions of the game. Though the PC version is much better (imo.) I suggest using the PC version if you can.</p><p>The prototype has 6 playable characters, and 38 stages of varying lengths and difficulty. It also has a level select feature for easy access.\u00a0</p><p>With that in mind, I hope you give my game prototype a try, and I hope you enjoy it too! Please leave any and all feedback that you can think of that may help with the development of the full game, I'd greatly appreciate it!</p><p>Feel free to comment right here, or reach out to me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/ElijahTully25) if that's more your speed.</p><p>And that's all for now, so thanks a lot for trying out my game prototype!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T06:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/cafdde7f4981096d4d1ab87a2b19e512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["TrueBlue97"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
