Who knows what you may find...<br/></p>\n<p>This is just a demo, but if you notice any bugs or anything like that, please let me know. Any and all feedback is extremely appreciated! <br/></p>\n<p>This has been in development for roughly 5 months now, worked on solely by myself except for the title screen. It's had ups and it's had downs, and I'd greatly appreciate it if you could just take a little bit of time to check it out. I plan to turn this into a full release, so be looking out for that :)<br/></p>\n<p>Interested in following the development of this game? Join our discord at https://discord.gg/nFMcbPxkTY!
