Play it in the browser, you'll need to use w, a, s, d, space, and the mouse. Send the link to anyone that you want to show. Thanks for playing!

Just click help in game if you get confused on how to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67ad18f1500293189e4eaf0483409a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ParrTay Gaming"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
