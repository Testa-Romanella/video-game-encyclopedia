This is the unlimited, ad-free, version of the hit brain training app.  Mind Games is a great collection of games based in part on principles derived from cognitive tasks to help you practice different mental skills.  This app includes all of Mindware\u2019s brain exercising games.  All games include your score history and graphs of your progress.  The main app shows a summary of your best games and today\u2019s scores on all games.  Using some principles of standardized testing, your scores are also converted to a comparison scale so that you can see where you need work and excel.  The Training Center selects games for you to play in order to maximize your progress and enjoyment.  <br/><br/>Mind Games incorporates Mindfulness exercises.  Previous research has shown that Mindfulness may provide improvements in focus, working memory, and mental flexibility for some.  Research indicates that there may also be emotional benefits of Mindfulness.  The app  provides instruction on how to use Mindfulness during game play and in your life.  Other activities are recommended that previous research suggests may help cognition for some  (such as aerobic exercise).  You may also learn new memory strategies.  No scientific research has yet been conducted to determine if the app\u2019s particular implementation of Mindfulness and brain training games has cognitive benefits.  At a minimum you can have fun challenging your mind with our games, learning a new meditation practice, learning about strategies that may enhance your retention of information, and gaining knowledge in the knowledge-based activities.<br/><br/>Languages available: English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Japanese.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090b90cc347064da47d32c35e1c16a8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mindware Consulting"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
