For an approaching exam, he's looking for alternative ways to pass, and skims through a book and reads about a powerful artifact!

It's as if he rolling dice to power his attacks.....</p>\n<p>Unlock new enemies and places as you proceed in the game</p>\n<p>A 2022\u00a0GMTK\u00a0Jam game made in 48 hours with the theme of \"roll the dice\". You play as Beebo encountering monsters in search for this dubious artifact. Instead of choosing actions, you roll dice to decide the power of your attacks and defenses. Sometimes you even get elemental attack, but Beebo can of\u00a0 course not control any of that.
