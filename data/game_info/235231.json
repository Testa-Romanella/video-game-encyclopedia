Solitaire, also known as Klondike, is one of the most played patience games in the world. Now you can enjoy it anytime, and anywhere, on your mobile phone or tablet. Share your Solitaire scores with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.<br/><br/>From Odesys, the makers of the best solitaire games for mobile.<br/><br/>The goal of Solitaire is to split all cards in the deck into four home stacks, one for each suit. The cards in the home stacks must be placed in ascending order, from Ace to King. Moves to a column must be made in descending order, alternating colors. Multiple cards can be moved from one column to another as long as they are properly ordered. Only a sequence of cards starting with a King can be moved to an empty column.<br/><br/>Odesys Solitaire Features:<br/>\u2022 Standard and Vegas scoring<br/>\u2022 Landscape and portrait orientation<br/>\u2022 Unlimited Undo and Redo<br/>\u2022 Solvable deals only mode<br/>\u2022 1-Tap play mode<br/>\u2022 Left and Right board layout<br/>\u2022 Adjustable cards size (pinch-to-zoom)<br/>\u2022 Sound<br/>\u2022 Hints<br/>\u2022 Timer<br/>\u2022 Animations<br/>\u2022 Auto save on exit<br/>\u2022 Auto collect<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @OdesysSolitaire<br/><br/>Look for other great patience games by Odesys.
