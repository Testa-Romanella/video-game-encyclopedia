Also called a <strong>zero-player game</strong>, the whole system will evolve by itself, without requiring any input from the user. It is also a great example of the phenomena called '<em>Emergent Behaviour</em>', a fascinating property that can be seen here, as only a handful of instructions are being given to the system, before initialization.</p>\n<p>The instructions used here are the same that were used for Conway's Game of Life. Here\u00a0is the list of the instructions:</p>\n<ol><li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.</li><li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation (next frame in this case).</li><li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.</li><li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell the next generation.</li></ol>\n<p>Of course, I\u00a0added some controls on top of it, to give it some extra kick. You will be able to change the framerate at which the program will run (going from 1 to 60 fps), pause the game and reset the grid/board.</p>\n<p><em>*I feel like this project is <strong>finished</strong> but if you wish to see more features (like a zoom or a way to change the amount of cells in the grid, for example), please, contact me and I\u00a0will see what I\u00a0can do about it.*</em></p>\n<p>As an alternative, you can also find this project on GitHub at this address:\u00a0https://github.com/PolyDevelop/CellularAutomata</p>\n<p>You can 100% use this project, without any limitation.\u00a0You can pass it on, modify it, sell it or anything else that your heart desire! (...<em>credits are still appreciated though :)...</em>)</p>\n<p>Stay safe and thank you for taking a look at this very cool program!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Louis Mareau</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f1/9f1625466fcb299813401d3cb0b7836d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BistroChug"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
