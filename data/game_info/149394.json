You have to defeat a maximum number of enemy waves. Each enemy killed is added to your score. Be careful, you have only one life. <br/><br/>This games was made using Unity 3D, C# and Photoshop. <br/><br/>I would like to thanks Robert del Naja for the music, those free jam asset were amazing, and BFXR for all the sound FX. <br/><br/>The game is pretty simple to play, you can turn left or right with your arrow keys or A/D. Use your mouse to shoot and to grab some ammo. <br/><br/>Enjoy !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df918e70023610e730fb5f5bfbd0245d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Atemu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
