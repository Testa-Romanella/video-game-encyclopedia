Them, who behave strangely, or us, that want uniformity in the pursuit of enforced normality? Who knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>YOU CAN DOWNLOAD OUR GAME FOR FREE AND ENJOY IT LIMITLESSLY!\u00a0<br/>BUT, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SMALL DONATION FOR IT, WE WILL DEVOLVE 100% OF ANY GAME REVENUE TO EMERGENCY.IT TO HELP OUT ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IN OUR TERRITORY.

Just leave them alone!<br/><br/>This game has been created by <strong>TEAM ORE</strong>\u00a0 at the 2020 Rome edition of the Global Game Jam by Codemotion. We then took some time to further expand the game a bit and to polish and fix it. A new game mode was implemented and a procedural golem generator engine was created using Inkle Studios Ink engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Ore</strong>:<br/><strong>Roberto Zangaro</strong>: Unity gameplay dev, Animation, Game Design<br/><strong>Diego Sacchetti (Morbidware)</strong>: Graphic Artist, Ui Design, Game Design<br/><strong>Ivan Preziosi (Radical Fiction)</strong>: Game Design, Coding, Audio<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1f8e91bb480e64557a54a6151cfef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RadicalFiction"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
