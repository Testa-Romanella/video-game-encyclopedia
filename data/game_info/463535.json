You can either click or hold.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>R</strong> to restart current level any time. Click <strong>P </strong>to restart whole game.</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick devlog here:\r\n<p><strong>Part1\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>First 2 hours:</p>\n<p>I managed to make some sprites as well as the movement for the chickens.</p>\n\n<p>In the last hour I did 2 first levels for the game to make it playable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>\n<p>In this part i think I did the most of work, I managed to do pretty much all the levels, and make the game overall playable. I also did the restart option as well as the reset, so the player could restart the game entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the concept for making chickens explode with blood. I didn't stick to it because I didn't really liked how this effect turned out. </p>\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>\n<p>In this part I mostly focused on fixing bugs and making sound effects. Sadly I forgot to make any music so the game is quiet. I think if I'll ever update it, music will be the first thing i'll add.</p>\n\n<p><strong>END</strong></p>\n<p>The game is finished! It took around 8-9 hours and overall it was pretty fun expirience!
