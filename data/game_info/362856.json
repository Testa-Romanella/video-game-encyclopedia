Two points are very important to us: a fresh game mechanic that lets you manipulate gravity, and an exciting, funny and touching story.<br/><br/>As Stella, a talented but modestly successful inventor, you live in an enormous villa that has belonged to your family for generations. However, your family is not an ordinary family, but a dubious bunch of ingenious explorers and villains. You are the last living member and sole heir - and the villa is no ordinary villa. But, well, you better just have a look yourself.<br/><br/><br/>In any case, the security system \"Dead Paw\" was activated in the villa \u2013 turning on a deadly self-destruct bomb. Hey, not your fault. But only you can restart the program and avert a catastrophe. The problem is - you have to go to the server room. And the server room is all the way in the other wing of the villa. Oh, and it is impossible to reach because of the security system. Phew!<br/><br/><br/>So you go on your way through the numerous safety precautions of the villa - armed with your gravity gun and accompanied by your talking hamster, Greg. Speaking of Greg: he provides the power supply for your cannon \u2013 and he is not super happy about it. But everyone has to do their part, right? Well, your part is to prevent a self-destruct bomb from atomizing you. Is that enough in terms of motivation?
