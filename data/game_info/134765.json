{"id": 134765, "slug": "luna-and-the-stars", "name": "Luna and the Stars", "name_original": "Luna and the Stars", "description": "<p><strong><em>Luna and the Stars</em></strong> is a short (5mins or less) collection/shump game about saving your starry friends from eternal daylight.</p>\n<p>It was made in Unity 2D using C# for a class as a way to get familiar with the engine and to make some fun pixel art.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>In the game players control the level headed and kind Luna as she rescues her friends from Soleil. Soleil is tired of humans writing more poetry and songs about the night sky than the sun- so she's stolen the stars brought about eternal daylight! It's up to Luna to restore the beauty of the night sky and save her starry friends. You must avoid Soleil's fiery wrath while collecting stars in order to regain your magic and take her down.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Luna and the Falling Stars is a simple catching/shooting game. Use the arrow keys to move &amp; the space bar to fire your attack. Avoid the fireballs and lightning. Collect stars to have enough power (5 stars) to fire back and defeat Soleil. Smaller stars are rarer and worth more points!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this small, silly and very scientifically inaccurate game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b1430196fb5d8a7097238131b1bc70ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ebeth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
