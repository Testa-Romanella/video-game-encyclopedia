A Demo for Episode 2 is also included with the\u00a0free version of the game. Please consider purchasing the Deluxe version of the game to receive access to the full 2nd and 3rd episodes as soon as they are released.<br/><br/>We will have more to announce regarding our release plans in the near future.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Decades of battling with a degenerative eye condition has left Burt disconnected from reality - but after he is selected to participate in an experimental drug trial, he may finally be getting the help he deserves. <strong>Available now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burt\u2019s conflicted feelings about guilt and responsibility lead him to seek refuge with a local church.

Content is to be considered in-progress and subject to change during the Early-Access period. We'd appreciate your help in making ViViD Relapse as high-quality of a product as possible;\u00a0If you'd like to report an issue or compatibility problem, send us an email; <br/><br/>dustin(at)wretchworks(dot)com<br/><br/>It is important to us that we\u00a0represent the issues depicted in our game accurately and respectfully. Please don't hesitate to\u00a0let us know if you have any comments, suggestions, or concerns regarding ViViD Relapse.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<strong>1.)</strong>\u00a0Some sound effects may be overly compressed. Please let us know if you encounter anything that sounds lower quality and/or out of place.<br/><br/><strong>2.)</strong>\u00a0Some cut-scenes can only be skipped during sections where text is displayed, and others are not skippable at all. We are actively working on this.<br/><br/><strong>3.)\u00a0</strong>One of the \"secret\" pieces of\u00a0unlockable content is not done yet. We'll get that finished up very soon. If you unlock it early, no worries!\u00a0You'll still be able to access it in a future update.<br/><br/><strong>4.)</strong>\u00a0Most distortion effects are not quite where we'd like them to be on low/EVIL settings. These parameters are currently WIP and will be seeing small tweaks as we continue making updates.\r\n\n<p><em>Follow our Twitter for official news and updates:\u00a0</em>(@wretchworks)<br/></p>\n<p>Looking for more ViViD?\u00a0Play the original 2010 prototype, and other related titles,\u00a0right here on itch!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><br/>Devs:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Joseph Pierce (@Dustin_Wretch): design, writing, audio</li><li>Nate Wiesel (@NateWiesel): design, programming, art, audio</li><li>Hinchy (@ItsHinchy): additional programming and audio</li><li>Maeve Wright (@YinMiushi): additional art and promotion</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional thanks:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Blokatt (https://blokatt.itch.io/bktglitch): bktGlitch shader</li><li>Yal (https://yaru.itch.io/): additional music\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34f8a9a09854e40355da79c0b7fc51ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WretchWorks"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
