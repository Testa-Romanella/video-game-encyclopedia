Approximately 5 years later (at the time of writing this), and unfortunately the final game is still languishing in development limbo, due to many reasons.</p>\n<p>This demo has a cut-down version of the planned final gameplay. For the demo, move Petunia around using a joystick in Port 2. Tap fire for a quick zap and hold down fire to wind up for a lightning blast. Holding down fire keeps the lightning blast going but drains your energy quickly.</p>\n<p>Holding down fire also acts as a \"pick up\" action. If you're standing near a yellow pumpkin in your pumpkin patch and hold down fire you will eventually pick up one of your pumpkins (an icon will appear in the top-right of the screen to show you that you're holding a pumpkin).</p>\n<p>This demo is really all about energy management:\u00a0your magical energy is shown as a sparkle moving down your magic wand at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Once you've picked up a pumpkin you can drop it into one of your cauldrons. This gives you a magic energy boost.</p>\n<p>Cauldrons can get full and once they are you can't put any more pumpkins in until a baddy collides with a cauldron and removes a stored pumpkin.</p>\n<p>Baddies will approach from the right, taking one of the lanes that lead to your cauldrons. Zap them accordingly. Using a lightning blast causes baddies to slow down as well and also gives you more points if you kill them with it.</p>\n<p>Colliding with a baddy spins you around, knocks you down, and drains energy.</p>\n<p>Little purple rolling pumpkins will replenish your pumpkin patch when they hit the an empty space where a yellow pumpkin has been removed (a purple rolling pumpkin will always fill the space closest to the cauldron first).</p>\n<p>The ever-present bat swarm will follow you incessantly, also draining your energy if you touch it.</p>\n<p>Once your energy drains completely you turn into a pumpkin. The End.</p>\n<p>This demo goes up to level 9 (I think, it's been a while!)).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T10:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a723099effce59c1882bbd414d856d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antstiller"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
