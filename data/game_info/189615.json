The only way to move is to magically switch places with other objects or players, who you are also destined to shoot down with magical orbs of the elements!\r\n\t<br/>\r\nTo win, you must be the last surviving of the 2-4 totems on the battlefield.\r\n</p>Controls and Tutorial<p>\r\n\tYou move around by swapping places with objects, because you are a totem. Totems can't move. To charge your swap range, you hold down RT and aim with the left joystick. This can be canceled with LT. Winning the game requires you to be the last man standing. To become this, you destroy barrels near enemies with bullets or shoot enemies directly. This is done with RB and aiming on the left joystick. This can only be done when not charging with RT.</p><p>Dualshock 4 (PS4) controllers can be used via DS4Windows, install and use directions are available at the link.</p>Objects<p>\r\n\tYou can swap places with all objects but some have special abilities.
