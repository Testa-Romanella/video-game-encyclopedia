We have developed a special smart algorithm which decides which of the missing pieces to show. This narrows down the matching possibilities, making the game even more interesting<br/>\u2714 The game tracks the player\u2019s progress, and adjusts the complexity of the puzzle accordingly, so that the player is neither bored by simplicity nor overwhelmed by complexity.<br/>\u2714 If the puzzle appears to be too difficult anyway, it is displayed in black&amp;white to make it even easier. A smart algorithm decides when to switch this mode on or off.<br/>\u2714 A cute interactive animation is displayed every now and then to make this game even more enjoyable.<br/>\u2714 The player can select the number of small pieces in the puzzle: 4, 9, 16, 25, or (only on tablets) 36.<br/><br/>Our goal at Forqan Smart Tech is to provide the best value for your family, allowing them to develop visual and cognitive abilities, to learn to communicate with their peers and the environment around them, and to acquire important life skills.
