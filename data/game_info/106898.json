Unity Executable for Win Mac and Linux</p>\n<p>this is a demake of Luigi's Mansion. Because of the time constraints it sort of turned into a survival game while you fight off ghosts. The mechanics are similar where you have to flash the ghosts to see their hearts and then suck them up to capture them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can interact with the props and doors with the Vac as well as \"E\". As well as getting some signature lines when pressing \"E\" when Muigi is not near any props.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Flashlight - F</p>\n<p>Vac - V</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n\n<p>Created by</p>\n<p>Crychair - Evan Malmud - Programmer, Voice Acting, and Project Lead</p>\n<p>Matt Daday - Pixel Artist</p>\n<p>Emmitt Spliff - Music/Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Kenta - Patrick Baker -\u00a0SFX and Voice Acting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5d/e5d7d96dc2eba8f55db2180f05a80b15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crychair"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
