Alien Cleanup Elite is a very classic old school action game. Aliens have infested the cities of the world and it is your task to clean it up. That means grab your guns and shoot them aliens to smithereens. But beware: One hit and you're done for!</p>\n<p>The entire game is supposed to bring you back to the old coin-op arcade machines. There are no menus, no options and especially no easy mode. The game is brutally hard and doesn't make any excuses about it.</p>\n<p>Levels are procedurally generated and the game features online highscores to compete with other players from all around the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a1cb3416e6bd7f71df43303d12098d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EzekielRage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
