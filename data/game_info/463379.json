{"id": 463379, "slug": "the-heros-journey-andy-h", "name": "The Hero's Journey (Andy H)", "name_original": "The Hero's Journey (Andy H)", "description": "<p>This is a simple, 12-step Twine story designed to help writers remember the 12 steps of the traditional hero's journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are several\u00a0 versions of this structure and they're illustrated in a variety of ways, which can make the 12 steps tricky to remember. This is my preferred version of the structure and I find that simple, fictionalised version of it helps me to remember each step and its narrative purpose.</p>\n<p>As ever, it's important to add the caveat that tools like the Hero's Journey and Dan Harmon's Story Circle are not hard and fast rules that should be followed slavishly to ensure that all stories are derivative clones of a single story.</p>\n<p>Instead, think of them as a structure to refer to when lost, or a set of conventions that can be manipulated and subverted for a more powerful effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A good example of this can be seen in The Last of Us Part 2.</p>\n<p>**The Last of Us Part 2 spoilers ahead**</p>\n<p>The Last of Us Part 2 begins as a traditional hero's journey:\u00a0</p><p>1. The Ordinary World</p><p>Ellie and her newfound friends in Jackson perform routine checks of the local area. There is a routine and a sense of normality.</p><p>2. Call to Adventure\u00a0</p><p>Ellie embarks on a quest after an inciting incident creates a problem that cannot be fixed from the comfort of home. This much follows the structure laid out by the Hero's Journey.</p>\n<p>However, before the end of the game we switch characters and discover that from an alternative point of view, Abby is the hero of the story.\u00a0\u00a0The character we loved from the Last of Us is, from another point of view, the villain who murdered Abby's father and deprived mankind of its one last hope for survival against the infection.</p>\n<p>The final challenge of Abby's journey (Step 8 - Ordeal) turns out to be Ellie, the apparent protagonist of the game. Abby spares Ellie and Dina - the second time she has spared Ellie. In sparing a pregnant woman, she shows that she is the true hero of the story and worthy of our respect. Her love for Lev now outweighs her hate for Ellie. She has ascended and can begin the journey home.\u00a0Abby's reward (Step 9 - Reward)\u00a0is freedom from hate.</p>\n<p>Abby's journey home (Step 10 - The Road Back)\u00a0includes her hardest test. On the brink of death, she is eventually rescued by Ellie and is resurrected (Step 11 - Resurrection). Mentally and physically, she is no longer the same Abby.\u00a0She is no longer driven by the need for revenge. She refuses to fight Ellie and is dedicated to saving Lev. She is now driven by her love for Lev, not her hatred of Ellie (Step 12 - Return with the Elixir).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Naughty Dog is able to show that each hero is the villain to the other, yet each is a protagonist that people love. This is an incredibly difficult writing challenge to undertake and the team deserves full credit for making it work. The Last of Us Part 2 is a landmark game in many respects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that in both parts of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog has attempted to tell stories that are dependent on the\u00a0medium of games.\u00a0\u00a0The success of these stories is made possible because video games are interactive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interactive media have a unique capacity to put us in the shoes of a character, which can result in an empathetic bond being built over time. Both games rely on this phenomenon to foster empathy in the player despite evidence that the protagonist's actions are highly questionable when viewed from other perspectives.\u00a0</p><p>So, if you're looking for ways to subvert the Hero's Journey as a narrative\u00a0tool, look to Naughty Dog for some advanced ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T04:47:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b1846d25afa483ac70b4878b2088af9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy H"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
