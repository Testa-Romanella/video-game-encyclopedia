{"id": 811233, "slug": "dungeon-escape-playdate", "name": "Dungeon Escape (Playdate)", "name_original": "Dungeon Escape (Playdate)", "description": "<p>----------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This is a game I\u00a0solo developed for the Playdate console from Panic. It is a dungeon crawler-type game where the goal is to fight monsters\u00a0and navigate through\u00a0the dungeon level by level to try and escape to the outside world. You play as Yoru the main character in this story and\u00a0\u00a0he has no memories of the times before being in this dungeon other than his home village and the need to go back to it. If you die you go back to the start of the dungeon so be careful and play smart!</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Hopefully, this is the first game in a series. I will have updates on that in the future so be sure to follow me on Twitter using the link below! If you have any feedback please DM me via Twitter.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed using pulp which has limitations such as pixel count, graphics capability, etc.</p>\n<p>It also doesn't have save states so be aware of that. I will work on adding that for the sequel when that comes.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Install guide</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Simulator:\u00a0Using the Play date Simulator\r\n</li><li>Playdate hardware:\u00a0Sideloading a game on the Playdate console\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>D-Pad</strong> - Movement Up, Down, Right, Left</li><li><strong>A Button</strong>\u00a0- Attack</li><li><strong>Walk into things to interact</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game takes around 10\u00a0minutes to play all the way through in one try.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong> Carson Neslen\u00a0@Cnez1300</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T10:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c13e7ce0ba03b28841d08334290af8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cnez Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
