Like all good \n      puzzlers, the concept is simple: connect blocks of the same color to \n      clear them from the screen, and prevent your stack from becoming too \n      high. There are four single player modes to choose from: Endless \n      (survive to earn a top score), Clear (eliminate all blocks above the \n      line), Score Attack (score as high as possible in two minutes), and Vs. \n      COM (use items and combos to attack a computer opponent). You can choose \n      from a variety of background music to get you \u2018in the zone\u2019, and even \n      play in horizontal or vertical mode, holding the Nintendo DSi system \n      normally or like a book. Whichever way you play, you\u2019re guaranteed \n      maximum fun!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d02f4bb496649ba81fa375e5941c78f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
