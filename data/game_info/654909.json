You lose the game, and go to jail, if 3 people vote for you, or if the group is unable to come to a consensus. If there's a tie in the voting or no one person gets 3 votes, the group will be divided when the police arrive, causing them to\u00a0look deeper into the case and you get caught anyway.</p>\n<p>There are 6 different endings, 5 for winning and 1 for losing. If you'd like you can\u00a0replay the game and see if you can get all of them.</p>\n\n<p>Brief Character Breakdown:</p>\n<p>Sapphire - You/Murderer</p>\n<p>Citrine - Your Victim</p>\n<p>Emerald - Confident, if not slightly arrogant man.
