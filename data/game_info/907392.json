With the intention of conquering the world with his minions as well as finding a bride to accompany him to the throne, he ends up interrupting a romantic date between a cowardly peasant named Juan and the beloved Princess Fifi, kidnapping her and leaving Juan dazed and confused. But after realizing the seriousness of the situation, Juan decides that despite the little courage he has, he must leave his fear to the side in order to rescue the princess, as well as put an end to the devil\u2019s evil. As you play this game, you will surely notice many references to beloved platformers with horror themes from the 80s and 90s mixed in with the plot, art, gameplay and even the music! This game is also a homage to the short length but the legendary difficulty of such games that made our childhoods, so if you have what it takes, expect to save the princess in under a half hour and successfully send the devil back to hell! Juan needs your help to traverse seven different levels full of monsters, traps, and obstacles that will try to put a stop to his journey, if you think you are up to the challenge then what are you waiting for? Juan\u2019s controls are very easy to pick up as he only jumps and attacks with his trusty sword, but learning to master his moveset will certainly give you a bigger advantage, especially in the later levels that will push you to the limit and require you to move and react fast! And if you find the normal difficulty to be too much for you can always set the game to the easier mode for a more relaxing time! <strong>Help Juan put an end to the devil and rescue the princess now!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T03:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e3/8e35d2b8ca701e20a9093d51c6122ba2.jpg", "website": "https://somespoonybard.bandcamp.com/album/juan-sin-miedo-original-soundtrack", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Scott Ian Ceja Lampkins"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
