I was using sounds from freesound.org and sprites from the GDevelop asset store.</p>\n<p>In essence, it is an endless randomly generated platforming runner.\u00a0 Platforms' horizontal position is completely random so it can and sometimes will create gaps impossible to jump. Don't sweat it, just try again!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W or UP ARROW - jump</li><li>SPACE or RIGHT ARROW - slide-kick</li></ul>\n<p>A couple of notes:</p>\n<ul><li>You can jump again mid-air (while falling) to traverse greater spans between the platforms. Use it wisely!</li><li>If you don't kick a Snowman, it will trip you over and damage you.</li><li>Collect crystals to replenish health.</li><li>Touching water kills you instantly!</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31f4e57d7d4abb4adbd719314a615f74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Avram"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
