{"id": 963016, "slug": "amalgamy", "name": "Amalgamy", "name_original": "Amalgamy", "description": "Amalgamy is a game of blending in. Act like the characters around you as you go about your task of activating all the rings. All the while, your friends are doing the same. You can kill nearby characters at the risk of revealing yourself. Or use one of the many abilities to remain hidden, reveal others, or change the flow of the game. Activate all of the rings to win, or be the last man standing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Be careful with who you kill, as it may reveal to the others who you truly are.<h3>Game Customization &amp; Extras</h3><ul><li> Population, cooldowns, abilities, etc...<br/></li><li> Randomly spawned ability pouch.<br/></li><li> A toxic rat that can reveal players and give you a gift.<br/></li><li> Obstacles to change the flow of the game.</li></ul><br/><h3>Over 20 Abilities</h3>Acquire and use abilities during the game to reveal players, blend back into the crowd, or change the flow of the game entirely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Recommended for 2 - 4 players, although it supports up to 8. If you are playing with 2 players, then I recommend increasing the starting abilities to make it more fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T02:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0440cbba096b76a2c04b2fbc1be2e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevDBuckley"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["DevDBuckley"], "esrb_rating": null}
