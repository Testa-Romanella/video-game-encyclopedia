{"id": 758302, "slug": "chickenz-zombies-from-hell", "name": "ChickenZ: Zombies From Hell", "name_original": "ChickenZ: Zombies From Hell", "description": "<p>ChickenZ is a game where you fight zombies, where the only tutorial is reading the controls on the options menu.</p>\n\r\nWhy Play ChickenZ?\r\n<p>Haven't you always wanted to see chickens fight zombies? It's the game you didn't know you needed!</p>\n\r\nThe Arsenal\r\n<p>Upgrade, recolor, rename, and use a variety of melee weapons, ranged weapons, armors, and helmets, to get your advantage over the zombies. You will have full customization of how you decide to kill them in this Sandbox-like adventure.</p>\n<p>There are also Unique items, harnessing random stats and abilities, with no limit. You can turn them off, or even have them replace all ordinary drops.</p>\n\r\nGamemodes\r\n<p>You have a wide selection of modes to play.\u00a0Campaign, which gives you 40 stages of storyline to complete - Each with their own modes like Survival, Zombies Killed, and Boss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also an Endless mode, allowing you to truly test your skill. Every so often, you may find yourself in the merchant's store - Allowing you to pick an additional upgrade to keep yourself alive.</p>\n<p>Finally, but not least, is Boss mode - Where you can shoot through Bosses in quick rounds, making your own loadout to get even better results. Bosses will increase in difficulty, with each boss killed.</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The gameplay in ChickenZ is satisfying. With it's unique critical-hit system, Rage that allows you to double your damage output after numerous hits, and unique weapons to give you your own playstyle, you will (hopefully) find the game quite enjoyable.</p>\n<p>You even have secondary weapons that you can switch between when you need. If you main a melee weapon, and a ranged enemy appears that your armor is too weak to confront, you can immediately switch to a gun to take them out.</p>\n\r\nWhat Makes This Game Great\r\n<p>This game can be easy, or difficult depending on what you want. With statistics, trophies, mods, allies, and more - Everything you control.</p>\n<p>The combat is satisfying, and there are some funny moments that may make you laugh.\u00a0Not to mention that the bosses in this game are absolutely crazy-looking.</p>\n<p>And if you find something that isn't here that\u00a0you want in this game? I will add it. Comment below or in the discord server (https://discord.gg/db2xN9m)\u00a0and if I like it, I will most surely consider adding it.</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you have an idea for anything. A boss, a weapon, armor, literally any content-related thing, tell me. I will add it! This game is supposed to be weird - It can be a shoe, a gun tied to a stick - Anything! As long as it's appropriate!</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88af01793024c52b3120621fb77f48b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BoopDoop"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
