{"id": 917296, "slug": "the-bull-and-mouse", "name": "The Bull and Mouse", "name_original": "The Bull and Mouse", "description": "This is a visual novel made in a little less than a week for\u00a0\r\nNeophyte Studios' 5th Narrative Game Jam.\r\n<p>\u00a0This short romance story follows a minotaur named Tory. She's a female womanizer with an edge whose favorite pastime is picking up girls. If she isn't chatting them up in a bar she's playing them\u00a0a song somewhere private with her guitar.\u00a0But today she'll be forced to use new methods to charm someone...</p>\n\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The optional theme was\u00a0<strong>Multimodality </strong>which inspired the circumstance Tory is put in that totally throws off her game and other aspects of the story.<br/></p>\n<p>This shouldn't take any longer than half an hour. I didn't have that much time to create it.\u00a0My goal was to just make something short, kinda funny, and hopefully at least a little interesting. I also wanted it to have a satisfying enough ending but also be something that can be expanded upon later since I think that's what the hosts want. If I was to continue this I'd make Tory a more redeemable character.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\n<p><strong>Sound Effects from Zapsplat:\u00a0</strong>https://www.zapsplat.com/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music by Eric Matyas:\u00a0</strong>https://soundimage.org/\r\n</p>\n<p>Click the audio icon if you want to toggle the music off/on</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/442ffa21789db6a32c336900fb3db195.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
