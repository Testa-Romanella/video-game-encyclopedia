You are the last human alive and your spaceship is being compressed towards a singularity. Your only chance of survival is to collect enough fusion cells to create a wormhole to escape to another universe. You need 7 fusion cells. You need to collect these cells before the universe shrinks to a tiny point! As the universe contracts, weird quantum effects are being observed on a macro scale such as the superposition of matter. Avoid the plasma balls and avoid being caught in the middle of some materialising matter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b7c943907265a46193d3fad393fbb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["kratorspore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
