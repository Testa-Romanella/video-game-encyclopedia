Also added local high score saving. Final boss may or may not be more broken than it was in the jam build, though.</p>Controls:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Left/Right arrow keys to move</li>\n<li>Z key to shoot</li>\n<li>X key makes you rotate faster while moving</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tStill a little broken in places, but I did my best considering I only started about 3 days before the \r\n\tjam deadline! There's a boss fight if you get 800pts, but the third phase is basically nonfunctional. If you get three hits on the boss I'll consider it a win (even though nothing happens after that)!\r\n</p>Credits:<p>\r\n\tProgramming/Art/Sound Effects by Eric Neuhaus (@donkeyspaceman)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tCreated with \r\n\tScirra Construct 2<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/2350c1dbb6dcb64279df9fa29c58d980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric Neuhaus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
