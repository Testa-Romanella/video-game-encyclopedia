During each phase of the game you can move your square in the 4 directions, and new colored squares will spawn and move in a random direction. Tought, beware, if you stay too long time without moving, the shake will increase and get rid of you\u00a0! The quicker you play, the more the shake reduces.\u00a0Survive a long as you can among dozens of colored squares with different behaviors and if you hit a colored square, you loose ! :D</p>\n<p>Controls : Move with arrows</p>\n<p>No songs or texts are present in the game but some updates could come soon ;-)</p>\n<p>Linux &amp; Mac\u00a0precompiled versions also coming soon !</p>\n<p>Sources of the project on Github at\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/pjdevs/uncolored.</p>\n<p>Authors:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 pjdevs<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022\u00a0Zaksley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T08:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1a986bfb06b0181f745d8e92d9d247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pjdevs", "Zaksley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
