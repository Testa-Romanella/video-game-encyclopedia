It was designed by Steve Turner for the ZX Spectrum.</p>\n<p>In Quazatron, the player-controlled droid (KLP-2 &quot;Klepto&quot;, from the Classical Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9, steal) attempts to destroy all the other robots in the underground citadel of Quazatron and subsequent locations.</p>\n<p>Klepto is maneuvered across individual levels of Quazatron, which can be navigated between via a system of lifts. Levels may include floors at different heights, ramps, information points, recharge points and patrolling robots. It is Klepto&#39;s aim to destroy all the other robots, whereupon the lighting on that level is deactivated. This can be done by damaging them with a ranged weapon, by ramming into them and/or causing them to fall from a height, or by a successful grapple attempt.</p>\n<p>Each robot has a two-character identifier which provides information about its parts and role.[3] &#39;X&#39; denotes a menial robot, &#39;U&#39; for utility, &#39;R&#39; for repair, &#39;B&#39; for battle, &#39;L&#39; for logic, &#39;S&#39; for security and &#39;C&#39; for command. The number is a ranking system, with lower numbers denoting better parts. &#39;9&#39; is a &#39;device&#39;, &#39;8&#39; or &#39;7&#39; for a drone, &#39;6&#39; or &#39;5&#39; for a robot, &#39;4&#39; or &#39;3&#39; for a droid, &#39;2&#39; or &#39;1&#39; for a cyborg. This ranking also determines the robot&#39;s security rating from Epsilon to Alpha. Security rating determines the level of access from information points. In addition are several special identifiers; &#39;OO Medic Droid&#39;, &#39;A1 Automaton&#39;, &#39;ST Programmer&#39; and &#39;AB Andrewoid&#39;. (The last two being plays on Steve Turner &amp; Andrew Braybrook&#39;s names.)</p>\n<p>The grapple system in Quazatron<br />\nTo grapple another robot, Klepto must make contact with it with the grapple activated. This initiates a sub-game in which both parties must light sections at the centre of a circuit board using a limit number of power supplies. Should Klepto win, the player may attempt to salvage parts from the destroyed enemy, with a more dominating victory providing less damaged equipment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-24T16:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9b24c834816d34fe752cdf03e4167ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Steve Turner"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Hewson Consultants"], "esrb_rating": null}
