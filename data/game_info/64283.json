He learned the origin of alchemy in the alchemy he got occasionally. The world knows that his greatest accomplishment was to create a stone of sage, but he did not know that he actually created a complete world. The place where the story took place is in the world created by this mortal.Story Background:Homecrus has a large number of countries on the mainland, including the kingdom of Lyon, which is world-famous for its advanced alchemy technology, the Ecija emirate with its inexhaustible energy, and the Kingdom of Loris that can use its mechanical technology to its fullest extent. Ferrina, who has occupied half of the continent\u2019s trade, has made the peace lasted for 100 years. Finally the emergence of a young girl broke this peace... Of course, this is something to come. Now, let this girl go to school first.System Features:Alchemy system and battle system are two characteristics of this game.Combat System:Abandoning the brainless and non-strategic fighting methods, we have adopted a half-turn system of battle. The character's speed attribute determines the order of the shots, and the sequence of the enemy's killing can reduce the damage to his teammates. Often the choice of the player determines the direction of the battle.Alchemy System:100% success rate with more than 100 formulas. Equipment, attacking props, recovery props, etc. all require their own refinement. Running in more than 60 game maps to collect material is fun.<br/>In addition, the game rejected the traditional way of escalating Daguai. The characters had no rank, and some of them created special items to open up the corresponding attributes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32a1247023cf67f79bcf560e4fd0a975.jpg", "website": "http://www.mo99.cn", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u9b54\u529b\u4e50\u7ae0"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["\u9b54\u529b\u4e50\u7ae0"], "esrb_rating": null}
