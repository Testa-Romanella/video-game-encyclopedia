The sunlight blinds you for a moment. You remember\u00a0Mark Fischbach, a man of many titles: A famous Youtuber, the King of Five Nights of Freddy's, the Head Engineer of the Invincible II, and many more. You find it curious that you're so familiar with him, but also realize there isn't much that you actually know about him as a person. He's accompanied you through many adventures, fought in many battles, and led you through many hardships. You owe this man your life many times over, and yet, he still smiles and is always willing to lend a helping hand. How did you come to meet this man? Where did he come from? Well, it doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, there you are. C'mon! It's your big day!\" Mark says, putting his hand on your shoulder.</p>\n<p>You nod and look around for your notes. You pick them up from your desk and walk out of your room together. You look into his eyes and notice the spark of ambition that wonders you. You almost want to get closer, but now is not the right time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You walk through the ship and look around. Everything seems to be in order. The crew walk through the halls, carrying random objects and maintaining the ship. You skim through your notes again, reciting the lines over and over in your head, all the while, Mark smiles alongside you. He makes you feel warm and safe.</p>\n<p>\"The stage should be this way,\" Mark says.</p>\n<p>You look over and enter the room. The stage is filled with people, many of whom are people who put their trust in you for leading them. Mark pats you on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"You got this, knock 'em dead.\"</p>\n<p>With that piece of encouragement, you feel confident enough to walk up to the podium and start your speech. However, before you can say your first word, a large explosion is heard, and the room shakes violently. You look around worried. Mark also looks concerned.</p>\n<p>\"It seems bad, let's investigate the issue,\" Mark says.</p>\n<p>Both of you walk through the halls, and the crew rush through with an air of chaos. You then see a swarm of alien creatures all attacking your crew. You've never seen them before, but they are out for blood. Quickly, you pull out your patented Feddy Fazber shooter and extinguish the threat!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da3b8b87d0758223209f1e75fb2a482.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dwagon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
