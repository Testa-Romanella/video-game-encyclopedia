Killing enemies with your very slow rockets causes them to spit out a last ditch attempt of success as they explode into bullets. These bullets can kill other enemies which leads to a the screen being filled with white projectiles, simular to the Shotgun Kin Enemies from Enter the Gungeon.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in <strong>6 hours</strong> for the 82nd Trijam. I finished the main gamplay after about 2 and a half hours, but the Music, SFX, Balancing, Menu and Endscreen took another 3 hours to get right. <br/></p>\n<p>Feedback and critisism are greatly appreciated, as I want to release a polished version of this game on newgrounds soon.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p><em>By the way, press the P, R, O and X keys on your keyboard at the menu if you find the game to easy.</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7565002a575923afa4f9f112b123cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
