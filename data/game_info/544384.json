You wake up in a seemingly empty dungeon. You try to escape the dungeon, but the lock needs a key. Strangely, there is a demonic portal in front of it that seems to change the dungeon, make it even harder to maneuver.\u00a0 The portal even doesn't allow you to save your progress.<br/>Can you reach level 100, get the key, and finally escape from this hellish place?<br/><br/>After dozens of hours playing around in Unreal Engine, this is actually the first piece to get to the public, aka \"my first game\". Made for \"My First Game Jam: Winter 2021\" here on itch.io within 48 hours in Unreal Engine 4.26.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T03:58:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc307cd013edaea4aa7ade0f767e8d99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abaris"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
