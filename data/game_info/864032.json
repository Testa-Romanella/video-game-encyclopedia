The game begins by introducing basic quantum ideas such as superposition and eventually aims to incorporate advance topics in the field to help players develop a quantum intuition gradually. This makes the game educational and beginner-friendly. Currently, the game consists of three basic levels and we aim to add more levels to the game eventually to make it a full-fledged game in future.</p><p>Gameplay Video:</p><p>\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oTSDONsytLBLJm4wGzcNyyCYKggKdeO6/view</p>\n<p>More details about the game and its github repo:</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://github.com/selindoga/Quantum-Game-Jam-2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a1678a0bc76f62085f5591cdd77627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Selin Doga"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
