I decided to make a very short visual novel where you play as the character a dating sim protagonist is trying to win over. It was my first game and I'm still very proud of it, for as silly as it is. </p><p>Play time is around 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how fast you read! One entire ending! Windows, Mac, and Linux compatible! You can see the nice things people wrote about it here, and a post I wrote about making it here. Please have fun! Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/00017b38600b586608ed824d519e5ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
