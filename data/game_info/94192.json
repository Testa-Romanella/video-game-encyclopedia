Use ancient<em> powers</em> to eliminate your enemies and restore peace to your realm. Hit <em>demon</em> monkeys with a stick</strong> <em>(yes ! )</em><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>QamaQ is a game made during a student project at the school of Rubika Supinfogame, France.</p>\n<p>We were a team of 7 people, and we had to do a top-down 2d pixel-art game : We opted for an action/adventure one, with a great emphase on action. We tried to make a short and simple experience, yet well-polished.</p>\n\n<p>You are playing as Iwka, a young monk living in an Precolombian inspirated world\u00a0who is now the container of the Yamt'a, the purest form of energy, the one which is possessed only by the ancient gods.</p>\n<p>This energy was spread around the world, creating chaos because of it's bad usage by wild creatures, turned crazy by their own power, newly acquired.</p>\n<p>You have to harvest it now, by defeating them, with the help of 4 competences, principal powers of the gods themselves.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>QamaQ is playable with Keyboard and Mouse. The Mouse gives the position to attack.</p>\n\n<p><em>WASD\u00a0 :\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Move Yourself. Useful.</p>\n\n<p><em>LEFT SHIFT\u00a0 :\u00a0\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>Run faster ! Useful too,\u00a0 for fleeing\u00a0 as for rushing !<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>LEFT CLICK\u00a0 :\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Attack on the cursor's direction. You can do a combo by attacking 4 times in a row, doing a more powerful attack.</p>\n\n<p><em>RIGHT CLICK , Q , E :</em></p>\n<p>Keys to use the competences. There's 3 slots for 4 competences\u00a0 :\u00a0 Choose your favorite roster.</p>\n\n<p><em>TAB :\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Open the Competences menu. Pause the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>KEYPAD_ENTER :</em><br/></p>\n<p>Skip the cinematic, or the\u00a0dialog. Be careful with this one !</p>\n\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>THE TEAM :</strong></p>\n<p>S\u00e9bastien Butor : Lead Programmer ,\u00a0 Lead Project</p>\n<p>Jules-Isma\u00ebl Tien : Lead Game Designer , Music/Sound\u00a0Designer ,\u00a0 Tech Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Killian Gales : Level Designer, Level Builder<br/></p>\n<p>Joris Fabre : AI Designer ,\u00a0 Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9 Rizkallah :\u00a0Environment Artist, UI Artist, FX Artist\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>C\u00e9leste \u00c9bran : Concept Artist, Environment Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Clara Wimmer :\u00a0\u00a0Character Design,\u00a0 Animator\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall,\u00a0 we would have liked to put more adventure into the action, like enigmas or level elements which coulda have been interactive with the powers, or different small quests... But we chose to really concentrate on the action and the feedbacks ! So I hope you'll have fun !</p>\n<p>Soundtrack :\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/lautregars/sets/qamaq-ost<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/60238dc80f5bb5120dc267a790bcfa42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lautregars"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
