I, the developer, wanted more challenge! In a short time the player is<strong> reborn and a ghost is born in the place</strong> and repeats the player's previous moves.</p>\n\r\nOkay fine, but what do these ghosts do?\r\n<p>\u00a0Simple, when the ghosts are born they can be charged or without battery, and<strong> if they are out of battery</strong> and the player touches them, these naughty red ones will <strong>steal part of your battery.</strong></p>\n\r\nWhat should I do then?\r\n<p><strong>\u00a0You must collect the batteries in the scenario</strong> while you are on top of a <strong>cart that runs through a cave</strong>, but be careful,<strong> calculate your movements well</strong>, because remember that a ghost will appear in the place when reborn, and<strong> after many rounds the scenario will go be full of the naughty</strong> ones that will occasionally <strong>steal your energy to death.</strong></p>\r\nExtra information:\r\n<ul><li>The game has <strong>4 language options</strong> for different players:<strong> English, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian!</strong></li><li>The game has a<strong> pause menu</strong> and options menu for <strong>adjusting volumes</strong> and <strong>screen resolutions!</strong></li><li><strong>100%</strong> game made by <strong>one person</strong></li></ul>\n\r\nNow a challenge!\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you<strong>\u00a0like the game</strong>\u00a0and don't forget to share how far you've reached! I developer checked up to\u00a0<strong>level 17</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Will you players be able to beat me????</strong>\n</p>\n\r\nPSV Games Studio - 2021", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/30512bc9179063af14da15122a5f80e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PSV Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
