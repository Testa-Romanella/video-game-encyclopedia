If you\u00a0take too long they gonna get angry with the bike management and they gonna get a taxi, so city pollution gonna increase. You can use a van to move unused\u00a0bikes between stations in order to guarantee that the demand is satisfied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bikes, Bike stations and vans cost money. But don't worry, each user of your bike system have to pay!</p>\n\n<p>Game description:</p>\n<p>You will play in a contemporany polluted city in which people will come out from Apartment Buildings wanting to go to an Interest\u00a0Point Building in the city through the bikes network.</p>\n<p>Your job will be to place bike stations nearby apartments and nearby Interest Points so users can go from point to point with a bike, and finally, your objective is to decrease the pollution as much as you can, so everybody is healthy and happy with your bike network.</p>\n<p>Be careful, because if users have to wait too much they will decide to not use bikes, so the pollution will increase, and if it reaches the top in the bar, the city will be polluted enough so to not to let people live in there,\u00a0you will lose!</p>\n<p>You can build stations and buy bikes for each.
