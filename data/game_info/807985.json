It's a love story about a university student and his rival, that get to know each other throughout days of running into each other, hardships, and drinking hot chocolate at a coffee shop! As you can see it is nowhere near finished but any feedback, motivation, or anything you guys want to share would be greatly appreciated! All the art is a placeholder/subject to change so don't get too attached! In the meantime though, I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>CoffeeShop Beta Demo 1.1</p>\n<p>Created by Ivette Barger</p>\n<p>Cutscene art by Sunnie Medina</p>\n<p>Sprite art by CHIBI (https://chibi785.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>GUI art by Skolaztika (https://skolaztika.itch.io/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T14:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08c/08cb14f9b22801ffdb709e19785bf1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ivy!!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
