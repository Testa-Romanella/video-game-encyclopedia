Words can go left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or diagonal.</li><li>Add letters to the grid in the blank spaces to finish the grid and find the 5 words.\u00a0</li><li>Type the 5 words you find in the boxes below the grid.</li><li>In the sixth box, type a sixth word made from the letters that you added to the grid.</li><li>Once you have the grid filled and\u00a06 words typed, click \"Check answers\"\u00a0to see if you solved the Wordfive!</li></ul>\n<p>Find all six words to win!<br/></p>\n<p><em>Wordfive plays great on paper too!\u00a0Stay tuned for </em><strong>Wordfive Volume 1</strong><em> coming soon! Follow here on itch.io, and follow <strong>@playwordfive</strong> on\u00a0Instagram and Twitter for updates!</em></p>\n<p>PUZZLE CODES</p>\n<ul><li>Puzzles are randomly generated from a list of over 3,000 common words every time you load the game or click \"Random Puzzle\".\u00a0\u00a0Each puzzle generated has an associated puzzle\u00a0code, which you will see printed at the top of the screen.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>If you have a particularly fun, challenging, interesting, or funny puzzle, you can take note of the puzzle code and share it with others so they can play the same puzzle. Put your favorite puzzle codes in the forum below so other people can try them!\r\n</li><li>If you want to play a puzzle using your own code or a code from a friend, type the code into the puzzle code box, then click \"Start/Clear\".\u00a0 (Hint: try putting in \"babie\" as the puzzle code. I think this puzzle does a great job describing an evil baby.)\r\n</li><li>Note that puzzle codes can be 1 to 6 letters, but only use the letters a-j. (I'm just converting the letters to numbers in the background but I didn't want to add a row of numbers to the onscreen keyboard just for codes. So we use letters instead.)</li><li>You can also use the \"Start/Clear\"\u00a0button to clear the puzzle and start over if you want a fresh start on your current puzzle.</li></ul>\n<p>EXTRA TIPS</p>\n<ul><li>Blank spaces are <em>always</em>\u00a0part of at least one word; however, it is possible for a word to be in the grid with\u00a0no blanks.</li><li>The \"Show 1 Word\"\u00a0button gives you just the sixth word. Because you get the sixth word, you also know which letters you need to put in the grid to find the other five. This is intended to reduce the difficulty of the puzzle. Some puzzles are significantly more difficult than others.</li><li>The \"Show 1 Letter\"\u00a0button will fill in one of the blank letters in the grid. You can click it multiple times to reveal multiple letters, if desired. This is an alternate option for reducing difficulty as some feel that the \"Show 1 Word\"\u00a0button reveals too much at once. If a letter was given to you by the \"Show 1 Letter\" button, it will appear in green to help you remember that it was given to you.</li><li>It is possible to find 6 words that are not the same 6 words that the game intended for you to find. This is called an \"alternate solution.\"\u00a0 When you click the\u00a0\"Check answers\" button, if you've found an alternate solution, the game will tell you how many of the intended words you found.\u00a0You can keep playing to try and find the intended solution, or you can\u00a0click the \"Show answers\" button to see what the intended six words were.</li><li>If you're playing on desktop, you can type letters and words with your keyboard. (When entering a puzzle code, make sure caps lock is off.) Also, there are a couple of keyboard shortcuts:<ul><li>Tab: Select next input box (going from top to bottom)</li><li>Enter:\u00a0Check answers</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for playing Wordfive!</p>\n<p>Wordfive was made with Python/Pygame, compiled for web using Pygbag.</p>\n<p><em>This version of Wordfive\u00a0is just the beginning--please consider <strong>sharing</strong> Wordfive with others and/or\u00a0<strong>donating using the \"Support this game\" button above</strong> to help Wordfive grow!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:01:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86dfcb20ba816217dfd58a541023a188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pobbles9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
