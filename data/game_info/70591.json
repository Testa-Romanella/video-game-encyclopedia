(technical knockout) scoring the most BATTLEZ\u00ae Points before the clock (1 or 5 minutes per battle) runs out! <br/><br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>The turn order of players in battle mode is determined by the games initial dice battle, giving the winner an advantage to play any offense cards first.<br/><br/>The goal of each game is to score the maximum BATTLEZ\u00ae Points possible within the time limit (1 or 5 minutes) or before your last turn is complete by utilizing as many dice as possible (any combination of 3: D6\u2019s with dots, D10 \u2018s or D20\u2019s with numbers) plus using any card options to score, place traps or reduce your opponents score/chances of scoring per turn/roll of the dice. <br/><br/>The more BATTLEZ\u00ae Points 100+ scored upon a knockout (K.O.) before your turn is over the better. This makes it more difficult for your opponent to subtract enough points under 100 from your score to stay in the game! Once a player scores 100 BATTLEZ\u00ae Points or more (within any 1-5 minute game) a knockout is declared, your opponent then has one last chance to roll the dice/play any cards held to subtract enough points to reduce your score back under 100 points in order to stay in the game! <br/><br/><br/>Sign-up:<br/><br/>Make sure to sign-up and save your game progress also receive 1,000 BATTLEZ\u00ae Points bonus!
