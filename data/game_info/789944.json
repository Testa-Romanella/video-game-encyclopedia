{"id": 789944, "slug": "castan", "name": "Castan", "name_original": "Castan", "description": "Explore an open, post-apocalyptic city, delving into run-down shops and apartments, where mutated creatures run rampant. Few survivors remain alive in a small, secure settlement. Paying off your debt to the Mafia will be no easy task as you dive into the dangerous, contaminated city of Castan. <br/><br/>Humanity has foretold many near mass extinction events that would reshape all life that existed on earth. But, when a devastating meteor shower shattered the world, things changed. It brought DNA and radiation that shaped the creatures of the world into grotesque monsters, that feast on the few remaining survivors. With time, many grew to accept the changes, evolving alongside this strange new world. Small communities were reborn, and trading scavenged loot or your own life became the new way of living.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Loot:</h3>Explore abandoned apartments, stores and more as you search for loot and fill your backpack with rare and now valuable pre-apocalypse goods.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Sell:</h3>Choose to sell your findings to a zany, unhinged scientist turned shop-keeper for money to spend on gear. Making your adventures in the wilds less treacherous; or opt to pay off your debt to the Mafia in the hopes to leave the island they abandoned you on. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Survive:</h3>Mutations have taken hold of the local ecosystems, transforming animals and plants into agressive shells of what they once were. Use makeshift weaponry to defend yourself as you try to navigate the concrete jungle that is Castan Island.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T06:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85b83828cba76a73818d560a262d5d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glass Nomad Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glass Nomad Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
