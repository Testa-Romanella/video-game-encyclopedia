The game is mostly free-form right now, and more of a \"create different sounds\" with the core idea of controlling a barbershop quartet. I'm currently thinking of ways to give the game something more aside from just the sound creation, but as for now, small updates would take place in form of background of sound changes, and maybe sprite changes if need be.</p><p>The controls are as follows:</p><p>W, S, X are the high, neutral, and low notes for Hershel (far left)</p><p>E, D, C are the high, neutral, and low notes for Bartie (second from left)</p><p>R, F, V are the high, neutral and low notes for Wyatt (second from right)</p><p>T, G, B are the high, neutral and low notes for Gerald (far right)</p><p>Escape is used to exit the game at both the title screen and in the game itself</p><p>If there are any issues with the game, please feel free to let me know on Twitter: @Smedwicks</p><p>And thank you for supporting the game if you choose so! I hope you enjoy it and I hope the future updates for the game will help make it even more enjoyable. All future updates will be free to those who purchase Barbershop Quartet Simulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a44ce7ad9a069bdd8e01f36f153e06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smedwicks"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
