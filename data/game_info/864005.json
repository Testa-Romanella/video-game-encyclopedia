Every interaction was designed to create an immersive VR world... and make you run for your life.<br/><br/>You wake up in a cell in the Triton Institute, an experimental asylum headed by the decorated psychologist, Dr. Matthew Simmons. Recently, there have been rumors of abuse and inhuman working conditions within the clinic; furthermore, it seems most of the staff has gone missing. Nobody knows any details, except this: Dr. Simmons has been conducting research into the tripartite psyche, as proposed by Freud, and how to break someone's id, ego and superego apart.
