Components are gathered either by collecting them from dead enemies or bought with the\u00a0<em>scrap </em>that\u00a0those enemies drop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Each tower has three different components:<br/></p>\n<p>Turret, Range Modifier, and an Ammo Modifier.</p>\n<p>It is up to you as the player, to decide what combination\u00a0\u00a0best fits the situation</p>\n\n\n<p>Once you decide what kind of tower you want, place it on the map, and let it defend from the invading forces. After you start the first wave, you won't have down time in between rounds to setup, so think on the fly and use what you have to defeat the enemy waves.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Constructive Feedback is always welcomed, please leave a comment below if you have any.
