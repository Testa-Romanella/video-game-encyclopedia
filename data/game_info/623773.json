I wanted to use a program that was easy to learn, although I want to learn programming I get blocked when I get stuck and this stops me making anything. I started this project with the idea to create the artwork, the music and the story myself and wanted programming to be more in the background as that is what I find hardest.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has a simple premise. A spaceman is off exploring, he runs into engine trouble and is forced to land on this new and strange planet. I started it as part of a gamejam years ago but never got close to finishing. I want it to have atmosphere and although the paintings are kind of unfinished now, they work for the atmosphere.<br/></p>\n<p>It uses one of the default interfaces from AGS. Right click to change the pointer to walk/look/grab etc then left click to do the action. You will be able to look at things and walk. The spaceman has no walk animation just yet. There is music and once you walk into the city that is it for now. The city paintings are the most unfinished.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/621/6218187d654d06344150d0af1f9f9270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Conradia00"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
