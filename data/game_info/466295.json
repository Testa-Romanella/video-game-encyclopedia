The theme of the game jam was \"Out Of Control\".</p>\n<p>Preposteroids is a bizarre spin on the classic \"Asteroids\" formula, where the goal is to stay alive and prevent asteroids from smashing you to pieces.</p>\n<p>In Preposteroids, your ship is placed in an arena littered with blocks of bouncy space-jelly. Coming into contact with one of these gelatinous globs will send you hurtling across the arena, which plunges your ship out of control - but could be used to get out of some dire straits!</p>\n<p>Many thanks to\u00a0https://www.pulsarbytes.com/\u00a0for making the fantastic Skyboxes available, and to\u00a0https://www.void1gaming.com\u00a0for the awesome\u00a0\u00a0soundtrack and SFX.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything else is done by me.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a23a99bc27696b81cb828cb2bc5682be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dangermau5"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
