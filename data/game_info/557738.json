No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb. The game mode is simple tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more. Run from the infected gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase people down. Hang out in a virtual, low-fi jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the Quest version of the game, so play with anyone, anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBecome gorilla.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-31T21:25:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74cbaabbef80442c6de5f9ea7efbf44f.jpg", "website": "https://discord.com/invite/bu9VJQy", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 392, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 14}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Another Axiom", "Josiah Jenkins"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Another Axiom", "Josiah Jenkins"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
