With limited spaces you need to make sure you get enough food and water to survive the camping phase as you will find yourself against a wall in encounters, gaining wounds... and running... a lot of running.</p>\n<p>As you load into the game you are put into the tutorial area we like to call it, but your bunker where it's safe from outside dangers. As it takes you through all the key binds and basics of how to play the game, you are launched into the world where you must make it to the next bunker at the end of the map.</p>\n<p>There are 2 sides to the game, 2D and 3D. The 3D aspect is you running around in a scene we made with generation of items, and randomly selected layouts from which we created. The 2D aspect is you choose your route in our generated map which allows you to choose where you want to go, making sure you choose the proper one since each place you can choose from shows you what resources reside there.</p>\n<p>Collect items from the overworld and store them in your bunker for more points!</p>\n<p>Goal is to get as many points as you possibly can. What score will you get?</p>\n\n<p>Steam page to come.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T10:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5cee0abc4ede44a6878a759c8d69ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
