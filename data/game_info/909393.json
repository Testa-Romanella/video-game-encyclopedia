The game consists of 3 levels with different enemies. To pass the level, we will have to collect all the coins so that the chest opens for us, which is the goal of each level. The player consists of 3 lives in each level. In the level selection menu, we will have both level 2 and level 3 blocked and we will only be able to access level 1 until we complete it, in which case level 2 will be unlocked and the same will happen with level 3, until we If we pass level 2, we will not be able to access level 3. There is not much more to explain since it is a typical game and easy to understand.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:18:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGRES68"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
