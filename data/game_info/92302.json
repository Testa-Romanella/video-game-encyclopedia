Much of this is also carried by the art style\u2014low poly worlds and abstract character art that feels deeply evocative, at once preserving the warmth of the pixel art that dominated Han Tani\u2019s earlier games, and adding the sense of freedom and size that 3D navigation can bring to the table.\"</em><strong>\n</strong></p><strong>\n<strong>Sanud, Videodame, Playing an Asian American as a Westernised Asian in All Our Asias</strong><br/>\n</strong><em>Seeing how Yuito feebly holds onto that loose connection between him and the Korean restaurant owner seems like the reality of most Asian Americans, but in Asia, the label of \u201cAsian\u201d becomes meaningless because of other minute differences, and the General is quick to point that out.

The graphic limitation is a symptom of the game\u2019s artifice; the graphic limitation makes us \u2014 and Yuito \u2014 see it as just a game. But the artifice isn\u2019t play, it\u2019s experiences. It\u2019s a life. And it can\u2019t just be pilfered for an answer on our terms. And so, what do you do instead?</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>Well, you just have to listen.</em></p><p><strong>Kelley Dong, The Village Voice, </strong><strong>\u201cAnnihilation\u201d and Alex Garland\u2019s Wrestlings With Asian Bodies</strong></p><p><em>\"However limited, Garland\u2019s scientific inclinations have led Annihilation into the long-contested debate of what constitutes an Asian body, an Asian identity \u2014 a line of inquiry that echoes the silhouetted mannequin of the composer and developer Sean Han Tani\u2019s 2017 game, All Our Asias, who asks, 'You and your relatives might be from Asia.
