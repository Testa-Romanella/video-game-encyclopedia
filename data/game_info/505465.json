When a warrior token is drawn that warrior may perform up to six actions. (One for each of the warrior's remaining    strength points.)    When an \"ATTACK!\" token is drawn all warriors in the attack zones of opposing warriors take hits which reduce their    strength.    When the \"REFILL BAG!\" token is drawn the bag is refilled and the drawing of tokens resumes.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b8/6b8e5d4eee227e46b64f4ef8e68b3ed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jim Smith"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
