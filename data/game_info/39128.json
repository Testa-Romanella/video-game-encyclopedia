{"id": 39128, "slug": "infamous", "name": "inFamous", "name_original": "inFamous", "description": "<p>This game lets you become a superhero in an open-world soapbox and features comic-book stylized cutscenes to underscore the superhero theme. The game is set in a fictional megapolis called the Empire City.  The player assumes the role of Cole MacGrath, a regular delivery man who miraculously survived a deadly explosion that destroyed much of the city. This trauma somehow gave Cole a superhuman power to control electricity. His powers can be used to move, attack and defend, and over the course of the game, he will discover a lot of new abilities. The powers are not infinite, and Cole needs to be charged with more electricity. It depends on you if MacGrath will use them for the greater good or becomes a villain. Every choice he makes in the game will affect his Karma, making him more Good or Evil. The central plot, however, does not depend on your Karma meter and only varies based on certain player actions. Because of his high electric charge, the protagonist cannot drive vehicles. MacGrath moves around the town on feet, often climbing up the roofs and using his parkour skills.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2009-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-26T23:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6e3/6e3e83ce5ccb49be4c74f987c1f8ed3d.jpg", "website": "http://www.suckerpunch.com/detail.php/games/infamous", "rating": 4.03, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 62, "owned": 887, "beaten": 483, "toplay": 94, "dropped": 90, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 414, "suggestions_count": 670, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 419, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sucker Punch Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
