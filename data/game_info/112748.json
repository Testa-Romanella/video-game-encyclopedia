This final demo aims at showing how artificially intelligent agents can cooperate in order to run a factory and build as many objects as possible, in an optimal way.<br/> The problem is divided in tasks (transportation tasks and building tasks) that are assigned to the workers according to their characteristics. The assignment is done with a modified Munkres Algorithm.<br/> This game was made with Unity3D and uses free models from turbosquid.com and a logo made by Hitchcock Creative. The icons were found on game-icons.net</p><p>See https://bitbucket.org/fdhalluin/epita_pfee_2015_lifesimulation for the source code (requires Unity 5).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d1e1e5483187b247abde22290a03d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cooperation-Corporation"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
