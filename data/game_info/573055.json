I loved making this game. It was the most challenging project I worked on. I made a level designer for this game. The main purpose of working on this project was demonstrating my programming skills.<br/><br/>How I made this:</p><p>The biggest challenge in the game was level designer and pathfinding. Unity's built in pathfinding was not an option because, it works as baked mesh. and this game needed a pathfinding solution that would work with always changing\u00a0 paths.\u00a0So, I programmed it in the level builder.\u00a0</p><p>This is a grid based game, So, all tiles that have no tile on top of them have a pathfinding node on top of them. The level builder connects all neighboring nodes. and creates a pathfinding mesh.\u00a0<br/></p><p>When a player moves a tile while playing the game. The node on top of where the tile was before is deleted and a new node is created where the tile is moved and is connected to its neighboring tile nodes.</p>\n<p>More gameplay links :</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a7d328d0990b9944b8fb9fb6f3acc39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nouman Waheed"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
