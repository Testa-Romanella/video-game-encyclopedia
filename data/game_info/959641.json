Having dropped out of college to focus on your newfound passion, you now live a double life: a freelancer by day and a gray hat hacker by night. But little does Kyle know, his life is about to take a major turn when he installs a strange operating system: Phantom OS.<br/> <br/><strong>UNRESTRICTED ACCESS (NO SCRIPTED LIMITATIONS)</strong><br/>A core philosophy of ours is a \u201cno scripted\u201d approach to player actions. You can (eventually, given your skill as a hacker) gain full control over every device in your network, delete, break (as in physically, with a hammer) any computer you can get your hands on.<br/><br/><strong>WINDOW-BASED OPERATING SYSTEM</strong><br/>A familiar concept to almost everyone, your computer behaves like - what else? A real computer. Run programs, create, move, and delete files organically, and given the special arsenal of tools at your disposal, infiltrate into other machines to steal data, brick devices, or spy on your targets.<br/><br/><strong>FULLY SIMULATED NETWORKS</strong><br/>Every computer, from those you target to the ones you own, are fully featured internet-connected devices, able to communicate and transfer files between one another. This happens via in-world routers and relays making up the network.<br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS BASED ENVIRONMENT</strong><br/>Your computers, like your environment, are real in-world objects. You can move, interact with, and modify them for your own needs. Make your hacker den your own.<br/><br/><strong>EMERGENT GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>The way you tackle missions depends on your approach.<br/><ul><li>Go in person and attempt to get physical access to your target.<br/></li><li>Remotely from your secured network<br/></li><li>Social engineering</li></ul> <br/><strong>FACTIONS</strong><br/>As you make a name for yourself, you will discover that you are not alone. Multiple other hacker groups will notice your actions and either take a liking for it or attempt to shut it down. Balance your influence with social opinion on your actions, maintaining a delicate balance to not risk detection.<br/><br/><strong>LIVE YOUR LIFE</strong><br/>The world waits for no one, not even you. Opportunities come and go and it's your job to make the most of them. The game features a full day/night cycle with events and opportunities becoming available during certain times of day, so plan and manage your personal life and schedule accordingly.<br/>Your surroundings affect you as much as you can affect them. Learn your town and its networks, opportunities, and exploit them to achieve your goals - be it fame, money, or connections.<br/><br/><strong>BEYOND/HOPEFUL</strong><br/>Given the early-access state of the game and our very small team (2), we plan to continue working towards achieving our final vision for the game, past the stuff mentioned above. This will include:<br/><br/><strong>MILESTONE 1</strong><br/><ul><li>Procedurally generated hacking opportunities (events, scheduled PC uptime, rival hackers' actions, etc.)<br/></li><li>Currency, inventory management, upgrade systems<br/></li><li>Leaving the apartment - outside city content: locations and activities</li></ul><br/><strong>MILESTONE 2</strong><br/><ul><li>Multiplayer V1 (hacking only - players can help each other from their apartments)<br/></li><li>Adding roleplay elements (NPC interactions)<br/></li><li>Game balancing<br/></li><li>Modding support</li></ul> <br/><strong>MILESTONE 3</strong><br/><ul><li>Expanding roleplay elements (reputation system, branching story)<br/></li><li>Diversification of missions, quality of life Improvements<br/></li><li>More content (larger city, more missions)<br/></li><li>Multiplayer V2 (fully featured coop and group missions)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T03:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b66ea0a596e04333ad14ecf741e9efea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Athos", "VL4DST3R"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VL4DST3R", "Athos"], "esrb_rating": null}
