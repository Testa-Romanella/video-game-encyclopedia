{"id": 533988, "slug": "hell-outta-here", "name": "Hell Outta Here", "name_original": "Hell Outta Here", "description": "<p><em>Compatible with desktop browsers only for now, excluding safari!<br/>We're developing a fully fleshed out version for mobile so stay tuned! :'&gt;</em></p>\r\nMINE UP OUTTA HELL\r\n<p><strong><strong>You're a dead soul working for Satan, expanding hell for new souls,</strong>\u00a0and you want out</strong>. Drill your way through the layers of the underworld and make it to the surface alive. Use punch-cards to determine your path-but choose wisely. Move too slowly and risk being consumed by lava; choose too\u00a0carelessly, and you may break down your drill bot\u00a0or drive straight into the lava pockets. The choice is always yours: freedom or fire.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n\n\r\nPUNCH-CARDS\r\n<p>Punch-cards plot a course for your drill bot.\u00a0You begin with only a small allotment of cards, so be sure to collect more as soon as possible or you'll be stranded.</p>\n<p>Punch-cards also come in three different rarities: common, uncommon, and rare.\u00a0Common cards won\u2019t gain you much distance but offer you safer and more predictable movement. Uncommon and rare cards offer greater distances</p>\n\n\r\nANGEL AND DEVIL CARDS\u00a0\r\n<p>Angel and Devil Cards have powerful effects that can either be a curse or a blessing. Acquire them by driving through them on the map and play them like any other card.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Speed Angel Cards speed up your drill bot for a short amount of time and are best played immediately before playing a punch-card.\u00a0</li><li>Lava Rise Devil Card speeds up the rate of the rising lava for a short amount of time.\u00a0</li><li>Health\u00a0Angel\u00a0Cards replenish your drill bot's health to full.</li><li>Demotion Devil Cards downgrade the rarity of the punch-cards in hand.</li><li>Promotion Angel Cards upgrade the rarity of the punch-cards in hand.</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n\n\r\n\u00a0DASHBOARD\u00a0\r\n<p>At the bottom of the game screen is your drill bot's dashboard. There you will find your Health Meter, the number of cards in your deck, your upcoming punch-cards, and your current hand of punch-cards. Use the dashboard to keep track of your drill bot's health and to plan your movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n\n\r\n\u00a0OBSTACLES\r\n<p>The journey out of hell is not an easy one. Along the way you will find near-impenetrable obsidian rocks and fiery lava pockets. Your drill bot can handle to drill away at some obsidian but always at the cost of your health. If your health runs out while drilling through obsidian, your drill bot\u00a0will explode. Driving into lava pockets always means sudden death.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\r\nPICK-UPS\r\n<p>You can pick up two kinds of items along your journey to freedom: Card Packs and Health Hearts. Card Packs come in sets of one, two, and three, with Angel Cards and Hell Cards appearing as single cards. Health Hearts appear as pink hearts, and can be picked up in the same manner as Card Packs.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Sound effects and music obtained from\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>---</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you for checking out\u00a0our first ever game jam (and first ever game!)
