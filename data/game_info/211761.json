The game tries to provide math problems/puzzles in an entertaining and engaging format. The game consists of multiple math mini games. The game is aimed at a younger audience to make learning math less of a chore. However, it has not been tested with the target audience and so the level of difficulty may not reflect a proper, final level.</p><p>The game is in Norwegian, but the tasks are as follows:</p><p>Level 1 (castle):</p><p>Answer the multiplication problems to shoot zombies.</p><p>Level 2 (volcano):</p><p>Answer the addition problems to make the robot jump to a new platform.</p><p>Level 3 (house):</p><p>For a problem \"X bla bla bla Y\", where X and Y are numbers, divide the largest amount by the smallest amount to hand out coins.</p><p>In some browsers the viewport has been incorrect.
