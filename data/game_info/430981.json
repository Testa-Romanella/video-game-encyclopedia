And it's even finished! Splendid!</p>\n<p>You've chrashed your helicopter, can you rebuild it with only an axe and a fire that threatens to run out of fuel at any time?</p>\n<p>Keep track of your fuel and other resources in the upper left corner. If you run out of fuel it's game over for you, buddy. You can create more fuel in addition to numerous buildings and upgrades by using the number keys while close to the fire. You get the resources needed for this by walking up to trees (and later on rocks) and swinging your axe into them. I'll leave it up to you to discover what all the upgrades do, I'm sure you'll do fine.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/>W and S for forwards and backwards movement.<br/>A and D to rotate your character and swing your axe.<br/>Shift to sprint (when unlocked)<br/>I to toggle ironworks (when unlocked, important to remember since they drink fuel like i've been drinking tea)<br/>R to restart<br/>Escape to exit</p>\n<p>Tools:<br/>Unity<br/>Krita (poorly used as you may see)<br/>LMMS (also poorly used, playing in a wind orchestra for 10 years hasn't prepared me for this)<br/>Audacity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:29:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309c95d814ab86c5d8b9e562a424abb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["axelrinaldo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
