Yeah, you in front of the screen! You look like a smart one to me! Can you come over here and help me out?</p>\n<p>\"You see, nobody told poor me that I would need to be able to traverse Rubik's Cubes in order to become the Easter Bunny. But here I am, having no idea what to do.</p>\n<p>\"Here's a deal: You help me collect all the eggs and in return, I'm gonna be a cute little bunny. Sounds good? Yeah, I thought so.</p>\n<p>\"Have fun!\"</p>\n\n<p>This game is a collaboration between my girlfriend (artwork, music, sound effects, level design, overall pretty great person) and me (mostly coding and way too cranky during this weekend, sorry my dearest!). Not gonna lie, we were very unsure if we would be able to finish anything within 50 hours, but in the end, I think it turned out pretty neat.\u00a0Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/369a19d971aa93cb303183bd8c6aadc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LukasWho"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
