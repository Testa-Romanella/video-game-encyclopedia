Adventure through dense jungles, sprawling temples, primordial caverns, and the otherworldly planes of the gods. Fight wild animals, carnivorous plants, towering golems, and hybrid monstrosities created by the gods of the underworld.<br/></p>\n<p>Stand against challenging bosses and learn the true meaning of sacrifice to restore balance to the world.</p>\n\r\nGame Design\r\n<p>As a Game Designer for <em>Balam and the Spirit Within,</em>\u00a0I led the design direction for the player controls, combat systems, AI prototyping, event scripting, tutorials, narrative direction, and user experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My first focus was to prototype player controls and refine the moment-to-moment feel. It was important that we made the player character fun to control in an empty room before introducing additional gameplay. Once I was happy with the state of the character, I prototyped two dozen levels to experiment with how the level design could reinforce our core gameplay experience. During this phase, I scripted and prototyped many gameplay mechanics and puzzles such as platforms, pressure plates, and physics puzzles. I used a combination of C# and visual scripting with Playmaker. I also worked closely with our gameplay programmer to prototype and refine our enemy AI to compliment the principle design vision I had established.</p>\n<p>Of course the game demo wouldn't have been possible without the incredible dedication and contributions of our artists, programmers, and creative director. It is still in production to this day and seeking a publisher!</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This demo is owned by Bad Tomato Games.
