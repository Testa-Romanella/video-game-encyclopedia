{"id": 438994, "slug": "the-hittite-prince", "name": "The Hittite Prince", "name_original": "The Hittite Prince", "description": "<p>This is the story of Zannanza, a Hittite prince. When the Pharoah of Kemet (Egypt) dies, Queen Dakhamunzu (probably Ankhesenamun) didn't want to marry one of her subjects. So she sends a letter to the king of Hittites asking a son to marry. King Suppiluliuma was suspicious but still didn't want to miss this opportunity and send his son Zannanza to Kemet.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Devs Note:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>I have planned this game as a part of a four-game anthology but unfortunately only this one was completed. It is completed because nearly half of it has been cut. So, if you find the game is a bit short, this is the main reason. The story is coming from the Hittite annals The Deeds of Suppiluliuma, which were composed by Suppiluliuma I's son Mursili II. What happened to Zannanza after he leaves Hattusa is unknown. He never reaches to Kemet, probably killed before reaching there. I didn't want to change the outcome. So, there isn't a happy ending but there is one ending in which Zannanza survives. I am not going to divulge more info if you want to learn what happens just play the game.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Code &amp; Writing<br/></p>\n<p>Ozan Emirhan Bayyurt</p>\n<p>Graphics<br/>Alper \u00c7etin<br/></p>\n<p>Music<br/>Un d\u00e9sert - Komiku https://opengameart.org/content/un-d%C3%A9sert<br/>Shifting Sands of Ma-Kali - HitCtrl https://opengameart.org/content/shifting-sands-of-ma-kali<br/></p>\n<p>Font<br/>Amaranth - Gesine Todt https://www.1001fonts.com/amaranth-font.html<br/></p>\n<p>Tech Used<br/>Yarn Spinner - https://yarnspinner.dev/<br/>Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d91db461270b41eb61e8b8a4df38868.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emirhan Bayyurt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
