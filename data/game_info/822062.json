{"id": 822062, "slug": "steves-reference", "name": "Steve's Reference", "name_original": "Steve's Reference", "description": "<p>In this game, you will play as a Steve-shaped character that has no connection to his arms and legs, while trying to reach the highest score and beating the exact same 6 levels over and over, but by a random order. In this game, you will basically jump over trap, move boxes, smash buttons, and collect score coins. Although this might not seem very impressive, think about that that this game was under development for only 48h.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>main soundtrack -\u00a0<br/><strong>\"Pleasant Porridge\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b706a9595fab27f58beca6713458db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Good K"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
