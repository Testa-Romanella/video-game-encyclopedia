My first ever Game Jam entry, <strong>Samson Galax-i</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was made for Week 2 of \"The Fresh Game Jam\" themed \"Galaxy\". Trying to avoid to kick off a Space shooter (creative, isn't it?) I googled around and found a mobile phone being a top result. Who would have imagined.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the Idea was to make a Mobile with somewhat spaceship-like controls. Some sort of difficulty was found quickly:\u00a0The fear of a whole generation, the empty phone battery! Fearsome, isn't it?</p>\n<p>So, in this game you have to explore a small house by flying from charger to charger. In all rooms except your starting room the charger positions are randomized so you have to search around a little and possibly learn the level to play through.\u00a0There is only one level right now, so I guess it is more a Proof of Concept and a Learning experience for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You die when you run out of battery or crash (meaning you flip your phone out of balance too much by hitting something or landing on an edge).\u00a0</p>\n<p>After you win the game will tell you the time it took you.\u00a0There is no leaderboard up to now however.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was entirely made by me including each and every Asset. Tools I used are:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Blender</li><li>Inkscape</li><li>Bfxr</li><li>Wolfram Tones</li></ul>\n<p>So... wish me Luck guys. I learned a lot an will do it again ;)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Patrick</em></p>\n<p>Known Bugs:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Lighting is far from perfect and makes it difficult to judge the player's position</li><li>There are bugs in the collision detection from time to time. The reason is my wrong usage of Unity's Physics Engine.
