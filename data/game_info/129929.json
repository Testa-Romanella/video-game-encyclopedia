Don&#39;t worry, this game&#39;s got you covered with some mellow music and relaxing visuals; you&#39;re gonna be fine... for a little while.<br />\nUse the mouse to select a plane and draw a path to the same colored landing zone. Landing zones will be cleared of planes after a time. Plane collisions end the game, and incorrectly-zoned landings increase the amount of time it takes to clear a zone.<br />\nMade for Weekly Game Jam Week 11<br />\nMusic:<br />\n&quot;Severe Tire Damage&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br />\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T11:09:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13a/13a3ac8e9a2b95c0d12906bc17991e0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goods"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
