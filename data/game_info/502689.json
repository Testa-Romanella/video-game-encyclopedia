Be sure that this is Alpha of the game means there are lot changes to be happened to this game. So dont judge us. BTW this is my first project on Itch.io. You can help us to improve our setup so we can make more AAA games. This is a FPS zombie shooter game with some evil corporations spreading this virus to all so u need to fight both humans as well as zombies be sure to rate it and write a comment and report bugs by sending screen shot in the comments. We will definitely improve the game.
