Trying to balance yourself on a crowded train in order to not step on someone's toes or otherwise embarrass yourself is a constant struggle. Over time, people tend to get better and better at balancing themselves on subways, just like players improving at a game. I always thought that a balancing infinite runner themed as subway riding would make sense.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed balancing the game and tuning variables to make the game experience more enjoyable for players. However, I learned pretty quickly that 3D modeling was not my fort\u00e9, and it wasn't very enjoyable for me. That being said, the smaller and frequently unnoticed parts of the game, like camera movement, visual indicators, and coding were all enjoyable parts of this for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/248/248271e494d337ce733d73781e9a3a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonah Gaynor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
