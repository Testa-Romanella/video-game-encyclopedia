To progress, you must master your advanced parkour skills (including a grapple hook) in conjunction with an arsenal of 8 different weapons to take on your enemies before reaching the final boss, BOZO.\u00a0 Solo developed and might not update but wanted\u00a0 to share the main concept. I can beat the game in about 7 minutes but normally it will take ~45 mins because it has a purposely high skill ceiling but only 5 levels, including one boss and tutorial. If you like it let me know and I might continue with the project, all feedback welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b453027de2265d0515984879cd3578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EvanG487"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
