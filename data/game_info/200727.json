To roll your dice you press the button directly above the dice in the lower left corner. The game consists of several phases that loop until you either get all the way to the end and win or explode in a fireball of missing graphics.</p>\n<p>The flow of the game goes something like this:</p>\n<ol><li>Jump forwards with your ship by throwing your jump dice</li><li>Encounter an enemy ship</li><li>Battle the enemy ship by taking turns throwing attack and defense dice (damage is calculated by the sum of the attack dice minus sum of the defense dice)</li><li>Win (or lose) the encouter and gain experience points (XP)</li><li>Spend earned XP on buying more dice or/and throwing your repair dice to attempt to repair damage</li><li>Repeat!</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a77f6076e56a3270e7d41031c1f84d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tim Eriksen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
