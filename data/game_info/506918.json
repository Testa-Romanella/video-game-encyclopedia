The goal of\u00a0 \u201croyal climbers\u201d is to ejec t other player outside the screen. To reach your goal, players have to climb as quickly as possible to scroll the screen more rapidly. \r\n  </p>\n<p>During this run, you can disturb other player with different malus but also gain bonus. Of course, the easiest way to win is to push your opponent with your hammer :p \r\n  </p>\n<p>Try to be the last one ! \r\n  </p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Player 1 : \r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Left and right arrow to move horizontally\r\n  </li><li>Up arrow to jump \r\n  </li><li>0 key pad to use your hammer\r\n  </li><li>Q and D key to move horizontally\r\n  </li><li>Z key to jump\r\n  </li><li>Space key to jump\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 :\r\n  </p>\n<p><em><strong>Source:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>I made everything except musics .\u00a0 Musics come from my training Gamecodeur\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><strong>The game is only a prototype </strong></strong>so there are not all polish that I wanted to add and some bugs are still present.
