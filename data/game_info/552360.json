It has <strong>less </strong>complex shapes, but <strong>more </strong>FPS; if you play <strong>less </strong>aggressively, you'll have <strong>more </strong>chance to win; the <strong>less </strong>gold you have, the <strong>more </strong>your miners will generate; etc... I worked hard on this game and I really like it. This was my first game jam and I learned a lot from it. Good luck to everyone participating!</p>Credits<p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com\u00a0- Music and sound effects</p><p>Everything else was made by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a990b99b05ff43b27935c69d79d1c31c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Code Scrambler"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
