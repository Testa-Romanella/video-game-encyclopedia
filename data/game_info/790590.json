A rage platformer. But what is wrong? The thing is, there isn't any mechanic for the player that makes you rage. Then how exactly it is a (wrong) rage platformer? Well, it's simple. The player isn't raged. But the opponents are. Are you able to make your way to the 100th platform and win? Good luck!</p>\n<p>I'm sorry there is no web build, but please. Give it a shot.
