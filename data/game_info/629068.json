Your Goal? BREAK THE GAME! If you find a bug that breaks the game, THATS AN ENDING! If you get so many upgrades that the game can't keep up, TRUE ENDING! This game is all about how you play it. And if you get bored, (I'm not supposed to tell you this), but somewhere on the upgrade screen is a gateway to unimaginable riches. So have fun play this BREAK THROUGH of a game!\u00a0 (Made for the BenBonk Game Jam 3!)<br/></p>\n<p>(There are a few visual bugs that could be fixed, but I can't do it now so\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Boost</p>\n<p>Right Mouse: Teleport</p>\n<p>Space: Fire Cannon</p>\n<p>A and D: Change Cannon Angle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T10:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38e402086a4da5abdc3d92ba1a61754a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrFlambo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
