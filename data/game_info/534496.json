Pilly specified he liked platformers, exploring, and music so I made an open (ish) platformer with an original soundtrack! The entire game was made in 4 days.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note the game does have glitches and many rough patches. I wanted to get it submitted before the time, but i may go back in and change/fix elements I don't like.
