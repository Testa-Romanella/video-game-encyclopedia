It appears to use too much memory to fit into the microcontroller's RAM. I decided too late that I will have to replace it with a simple font tile set, and then ran into issues setting up the correct embedded data (uncompressed grayscale array in program memory) with the tools I had on-hand.</li><li>The ESP8266 version of the project can output to a 64x32 internal frame buffer, but the font is not available and the result is only viewable in a serial terminal.</li><li>After disassembling the actual LeapTop device, I found that the display is most likely directly attached to its processor, which makes it challenging to hack in the microcontroller. Similar devices are 6502-based and have a discrete flash ROM chip, so it may be possible to reprogram the 6502 to pass the frame buffer data to the display. If not, the entire display could be replaced with one more suitable for the ESP8266.</li><li>The addition game was quickly thrown together using CImg.h's font as a proof-of-concept. \"Scrolling\" was intended to be a proof-of-concept for how 2D tile map\u00a0graphics can be displayed within a 64x32 viewport.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/665cc3c44b143f41d7624ece3dcfa7aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tarsi"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
