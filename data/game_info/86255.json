You start the game as the lead Air Traffic Controller at Honolulu International Airport. Help Gulfstream G650 aircraft land at your airport before they run out of fuel.

Then it is time for more passengers and a timely takeoff. <br/><br/>The fun is just beginning. Move on to the rolling hills of San Francisco and say hello to the Boeing 737. The challenge continues in the mountains of Geneva, Switzerland with hungry passengers and a special food service. If you master that, be the first to fly the Airbus A380 in the bustling port of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. If you can handle that double decker, continue east to the tricky landings and urban life of Hong Kong and repair planes flying in from far away. Prove your mettle at busy and crowded JFK International in New York City and at London's Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom. Then head down under to Sydney\u2019s Kingsford Smith Airport where FedEx planes load up parcels before they head out.
