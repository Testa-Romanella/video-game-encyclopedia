All you should do is control the movement of the character and dodge \u00a0the creepers spawned \u00a0from the edge. This \u00a0is my first game. There are no bugs on Windows, but there is something wrong with the Android vision. \u00a0You can find it in the Github Link, and it may be updated. Have fun with this game!</p><p>As \u00a0you see, there're some Chinese characters in the game, don't worry, it won't make itself different and not pleasant! I placed these characters to make my game looks \"Awesome\"\uff01Haha...</p><p>Of course, you can use [W][A][S][D] or touch the screen buttons to move the character!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T12:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a1390b7250be48ca34c409333e36d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkyShadowHero"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
