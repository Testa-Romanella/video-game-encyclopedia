It's an engine that renders the image via CPU, without involving the graphics adapter, much like the 90's games did. I wanted to find out if it's possible to code an engine like that from scratch nowadays, and if it can run at 60 FPS on a modern PC. It was a self-imposed challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce I finished the engine, I thought I could make a game with it, an FPS like the early shooters from the 90's. I have to say I was quite impressed with them back in the day, and I've been looking to recreate them for a long time. Thus, this game is a 90's FPS. A simplistic story takes a backseat to pure run-and-gun gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn graphics and visuals: I was creating the visuals based on the imagery from my dreams. I tried to convey the mood and atmosphere of my dreams through level design. I feel like I did a particularly good job on this aspect.<br/>\r\nI'd be happy to hear some feedback from you on my humble little game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T19:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43ceaa5d202e2382e5dbfecddb5f39d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
