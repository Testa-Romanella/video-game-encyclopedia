Phill, a renown guerilla is being summoned to Valour City to help the rebels. Along the way, he'll meet characters that either help or impend the progress. Can he trust them?<br/><br/>The story represents an integral part of the game where there will be lots of scripted events that move the plot. These events are dynamic which depends on whose characters recruited in the game. The game is separated into 3 acts. Act 1 is almost complete while we are working on Act 2 and Act 3. There will be choices within Act 1. The choices will be carried forward to Act 2 and 3 which will affect what really happens in the final battle scene.<br/><br/>This is actually a small game of which you can finish all 3 acts in less than 6 hours. The game takes place in a single city, Valour City where you will carry out quests to help build the Alliance and working for the rebels to wrestle control from the Empire. All of these will culminate in the final battle scene where you will face your arch nemesis, Lady Vanity. If you survive, you will discover that the world will plunge into an apocalyptic scenario.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Turn-based combat with lots of tactical option (stand/crouch, target head/torso/leg and line of sight).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Partial cover system allows player or enemy to crouch behind an object to gain a cover advantage.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Hostile AI trigger combat through the line of sight.
