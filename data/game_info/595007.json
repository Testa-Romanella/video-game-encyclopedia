You don't want that. You just want one part of the deal.</p>\r\nMAIN FEATURES\r\n<p><strong>Siphon the energies </strong>of the Nine Layers of Hell - but beware, the further you tap into its power, the stronger its grasp...</p>\n<p><strong>Strategize and experiment!</strong> In all levels, there are multiple ways to set up your buildings.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple levels available </strong>for replayability and increased difficulty.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<ul><li><strong>Protect your siphons.</strong> The Siphons provide you with Infernite, which you can use to create buildings.</li><li><strong>Create defenses</strong> to stop the Corruption from spreading to your Siphons. Build up your walls and hunker down.</li><li><strong>Power your defenses</strong> by placing Generators, which create Energy, and build cables to transport the Energy to your buildings.</li><li><strong>Upgrade your buildings:</strong> if you have enough Infernite, you can click on them and click the Upgrade button to increase their effectiveness (for Towers and Walls) or their Energy output (for Generators).</li><li><strong>Keep the Corruption at bay</strong> until you reach the Ninth Layer and extract all of its virtues.</li></ul>\r\nGAMEPLAY TIPS\r\n<p>Try to experiment! But if you're having trouble:</p>\n<ul><li>Walls greatly slow the spread of Corruption through them. Place them at your front lines, such as near the Portal.</li><li>Pulsar Towers remove Corruption in an area, and are most effective when they cover lots of tiles.</li><li>Solar Towers target only one tile at a time, which makes them very good to place near choke points, or across chasms.</li><li>Remember to upgrade your buildings (click on them), to improve their efficiency or Energy output.</li></ul>\n<p>Advanced tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Generators also work like Cables, in that they allow Energy to pass through them in all directions. You can use this to save space.</li><li>In a pinch, you can Deconstruct buildins (click on them) to receive some Infernite back. You could use this to move your buildings backwards, for example.</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<ul><li><strong>Jorrit Neslo</strong> - environment art, UI art</li><li><strong>Sam Minh Ly</strong> - level design, balancing, visual effects</li><li><strong>Mika Molenkamp</strong> - programming, audio &amp; UI implementation</li></ul>\n<p>Fonts used: Zebulon, Spaceline, Sansation (1001freefonts.com)</p>\n<p>Music and sounds from opengameart.org (Beeping Bobbing, Humming Beetle, Electrosteel, Blind Shift) and freesound.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a8/3a878a75c859a512a9f1ea9439229cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BinarySpark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
