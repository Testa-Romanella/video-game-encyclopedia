This game is a homage to old school arcade space shooters with a twist on the controls. You're stuck in the gravitational pull of the asteroid belt, slowly trying to build up speed to escape the loop of the orbit. However, with each speed increase it becomes harder to dodge the incoming asteroids.</p>\n<p>While there are some issues with the game (yes I am aware the spawning sometimes leaves something to be desired) I will be updating the game with a few tweaks and fixes after Ludum Dare is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/216d5ea468a0618fbf61c06ce95658b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carris"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
