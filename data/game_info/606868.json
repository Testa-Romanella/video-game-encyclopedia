To move, click anywhere on the screen drag your mouse away and release. If Boxy is grounded\u00a0this will fling Boxy in the opposite direction. You don't have to click on the box itself. The amount u fling is based of how long of line u drag. Boxy will reach out in their intended direction.\u00a0<br/><br/>Tips: Over time u get slightly bigger and score points for how big you are.
