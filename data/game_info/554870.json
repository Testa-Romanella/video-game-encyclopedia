If the timer (60 seconds) runs out or you get over 100 bugs, the game is over. Bugs breed (very buggily) with each other when they get close.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple: drag bugs across the screen with the mouse.</p>\n<p>This was both of our first jams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1dc0afaa418357ad999b6527cbd7cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jazzed_Iceberg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
