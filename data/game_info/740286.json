If you guess correctly, the letter will show in the word.

It sat on their computer for four years, so they thought they might as well release it to the wild.<br/></p>\n<p>The straightforward game was designed in Godot Engine and scripted using GDScript. A seven-letter word is randomly chosen from a list of 100 words. The code is unnecessarily long (with a variable for each letter of the alphabet),\u00a0 and, quite frankly, looks more like a 2D platformer than a simple word game. Maybe the dev will go back and optimise it at some point, but I doubt it'll be the next 'Wordle'...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d4/5d46e5fa84628d9173384c6a035edb1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pinelark Nerd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
