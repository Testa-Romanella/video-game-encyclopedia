Which weapon will you get? Will you play a 2v2, 3v1, 1vAll? You will need fast reflexes and to be able to adapt to any situation in order to defeat your enemies.<br/><br/>Square Arena is a multiplayer game but if you're playing solo, you should enjoy the Zombots mode :)<br/><br/>TRAILER: https://youtu.be/F3YnrJUl8rU", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96f/96fe560af56bd6ae2cf92df50c0add61.jpg", "website": "http://www.square-arena.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hepta Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hepta Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
