Can you survive with only the Tools and Resources that <strong>YOU</strong> decided to bring?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every item has advantages and disadvantages if brought with you. You have limited space in your bag, so you'll have to choose your gear carefully. Perhaps you prefer a convenient headlamp, or perhaps a reliable glowstick? It's your choice what items work for you! <br/><br/><br/><br/>ChiroTerra is a maze of tunnels, you'll need to think hard on how to navigate them. You could bring chalk to mark your way through the cave, or a lighter that can pick up on the caves draft, or you could bring both if you have the enough space. Either way, wandering around aimlessly is a surefire way to freeze to death.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lastly remember you're not alone in those dark, dank tunnels. Listen for the pitter patter sound of hands crawling. If you hear it, then hide or ready something to scare it off! Just make sure you packed enough flares, or make sure you still have some bullets.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/642c4a66448feeea49c01b3d3129e1c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Nightmare Jar"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Nightmare Jar"], "esrb_rating": null}
