Another is just doing his job. The two find themselves trapped in a village full of monsters from ancient Japan. They'll need to work together to save themselves - and save the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Youkai Village</strong> is a short Japanese Role-Playing Game. See how the story develops as you investigate and fight your way through a location full of strange creatures! Not that our protagonists aren't a little strange, themselves, or at least a bit silly...<br/></p>\n<p>Youkai Village contains some light horror elements (e.g. discussions of death, spiders). This game is recommended for players ten and up, primarily due to reading level, but it is intended to be fun for all ages. No prior experience is necessary to play. <br/></p>\r\n Info\r\n<p>\r\nYoukai Village is a solo dev RPG Maker game. This is the dev's first \r\nfull game, created over the last six months of 2022. Most of the coding and all of the \r\nnon-RPG-Maker art assets were done by Ammika (catgirltomboy), with some \r\nfree-to-use code and music added in.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Turn-based combat!</li><li>Simple puzzles!</li><li>Over 30 little areas to explore!
