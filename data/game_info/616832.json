Gameplay is pretty sweet if you enjoy zipping around like a ninja!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong><strong>WASD </strong>= Movement<br/><strong>Space </strong>= Jump<br/><strong>Left-Click-Mouse</strong> = Fire<br/><strong>E</strong> = Interact<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Malicious\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong>\n<strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong>\n<strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/094389c235ab3e593575ee356d748472.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fmlad"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
