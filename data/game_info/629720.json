Due to the different start times of the jams we only had 1 day and 19 hours, or 43 hours for this jam (so be gentle this is just a bit of fun xD)</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Press the Space Bar to flip gravity and go to the other side! Beware of any obstacles, if you fall too far back, and touch the lava, its game over! <strong>How long can you survive in this randomly generated infinite runner?</strong></p>\n<p>The speed increases every 12 seconds, you might think its easy to start with, but just you wait!</p>\r\nLeaderboard:\r\n<ol><li>\u00a0<strong>BBomb11</strong>: 75.2</li><li>\u00a0<strong>AustinAtl</strong>: 73.7\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Pizza_Gamer</strong>: 73.5</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Rig 'n Pat</strong>: 69.8</li><li><strong>\u00a0Green Player</strong>: 68.1</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Submit your time below if you think you can claim a place in the top 5!</strong><br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Everything was made during the time limits of both jams by myself (BLANKdev) and Bbomb!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af7edfd0b9841c40633d6c205bcea775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BLANKdev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
