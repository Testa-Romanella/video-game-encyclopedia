It follows the progress of a space cadet named Lancy in her struggle to liberate a Lothian space colony of the imninent space threat: \"These\u00a0things,\u00a0seem\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0nest\u00a0or\u00a0boss\u00a0like\u00a0controlled\u00a0bio-organisms,\u00a0annihilating\u00a0and\u00a0assimilating\u00a0everything\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0path.\"</p>\n<p>The\u00a0Ex4cE are mainly\u00a0formed\u00a0from\u00a0former Freedom Figthers United (FFU) personnel. The main reason for the split being that the FFU are\u00a0now\u00a0corporate\u00a0funded\u00a0and taking advantage o the threat situation through \"Planetary Protection Plans\" which are in truth just meant to drawin resources in exchange of rather brief times of security.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60c35c56592f1391454558458486bff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cpet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
