Will you make it in time?!</p><p>Edit: I was informed of an issue regarding a fatal error upon startup of the game. This was due to the missing monobleedingedge folder. We are very sorry about this inconvenience. Here is the link where the folder can be downloaded:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O7RoEU6z8E-WDes1Wt_tTl3h6AD9Ma5z?usp=sha...\u00a0</p><p>It probably will come up inside the monobleedingedge folder, so above the files it should show My Drive &gt; MonoBleedingEdge. Just click on the Mono and near the bottom should say Download. Follow the instructions with the download and the game should boot up.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-TigerRace &amp; Stigmister\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e807ed99af5daeb1e8552a55237d7264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stigmister", "TigerRace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
