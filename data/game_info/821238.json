Are you ready to roll the dice and strike down your foes?</p>\n<p>To win each level you must kill ever enemy on screen, so if they haven't spawned yet you will win the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Roll the dice to be able to move (WASD) as well as attack.</p>\n<p>Use the sword to slash enemies next to you. Use the bow to strike enemies in line with you. Or use magic to attack in an area at a greater cost.</p>\n<p>I probably should have been less ambitious for a 48hour jam, especially with using grid based movement for the first time, but ayyyy we live and learn. Might add more levels in future, but I\u00a0wouldn't count on it. I'd also probably add proper controller support, right now you can move but not use any of the moves.</p>\n<p>You can see my previous versions on Github (I will add after the jam as the rules do not let me link versions offsite)\u00a0, and progress videos on the youtube playlist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ecef3fdb152de8d6330f17b39b7e02f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BirbRoss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
