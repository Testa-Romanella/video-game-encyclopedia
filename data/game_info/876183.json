But some white light flashed through and Thomas fainted. He woke up to be an astronaut from the past, Thomas William. Rogan Richard, Bobby Miller and Thomas William took part in this astronaut training. The S.E.A.M 11 spacecraft was launched on 6 October 1975 and was preparing to dock to the I.C.E.S 1 (International Centre Energy Space Station). Upon entering the station, the crew performed several duties including fixing their own spaceship for several days. After that, three cosmonauts loaded scientific specimens, films, tapes, and other gear to their spacecraft and re-enter earth. During their return to earth, unexpected things happen to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Player need to complete several operations in order to progress throughout the game.
