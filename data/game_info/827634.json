You will spawn in a floor made out of random dices (which I created in a matrix). Watch out because you will only have 1 second on the\u00a0block after that it will desapear. In addition you will have to fight with a boss and the only way that you could harm it if you step on as many blocks as you can.\u00a0 The boss will get equal damage as the number of that side of the dice which you are standing at. Have fun! :]<br/></p><p>Every audio was taken from\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T12:32:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49a8d49fcaf363303f6560558436fd5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anonymus Nemo Utiz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
