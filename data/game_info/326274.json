Inspired by old classics of the genre, the game blends comedy and drama to form a story that challenges your brain and teases your heart.<br/><br/>Our story takes place in the Trappist-1 planetary system, approximately 39 light years away from Earth. Below the frozen surface of planet Eedor, a group of children has spent their entire lives in the safe confines of a technologically advanced cave, raised by artificially intelligent robots. Without knowledge of their origins and with only a voice recording to guide them, the children devote their lives to the maintenance of their underground society and the preparation for the \u201cPilgrimage\u201d, a task that has proven impossible for the chosen \u201cpilgrims\u201d, time and time again.<br/><br/>Aurora, our heroine, is the only child in the Cave with a mysteriously incomplete message. As her wild, curious nature is challenged by the rigid society of the Cave, and the frustration over her confusing identity grows, Aurora decides to take matters into her own hands. The next celebration is coming; this is her chance to prove herself a worthy \u201cpilgrim\u201d and attempt the impossible journey through the frozen wastes of Eedor, to the top of the \u201cHollow Mountain\u201d. There, she may finally ask the \u201cVoices\u201d her one and only question:<br/><br/>\u201cWhat is my Voice?\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Aurora</strong>:<br/>Aurora is the youngest child in the Cave.
