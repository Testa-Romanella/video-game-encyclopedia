Do you enjoy the rewarding feeling after unlocking hard earned stuff?<br/><br/>THIS-IS-YOUR-GAME!<br/><br/>I've been working and updating this game in my free time, as a hobby, during the last two years. I want to thank the Discord community for their support and feedback. Hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fuse two Pins to get an improved and stronger version. Sometimes they will result in a completely new and different Pin!<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Plan your strategy. Add Pins into a formation, each Formation with its own spcial bonus, slots amount and slot types. Choose the best combination for each situation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore different locations. Each with their own enemies, materials, and drops. Advance through zones and maps to find new crafting blueprints and unlock new features!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Tune and improve your attack Pins stats like their power and HP or even the chance of multihit! Can you get S+ Rank tunes on all the 11 stats?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Follow the clues and unlock The Tower. Send expeditions to find new floors with randomized enemies and loot, keep the ones you like and build your own Tower!  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course there is a prestige mechanic! Start a new season and sacrifice some progress to unlock over 200 powerful upgrades. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Over 250 different Pins to collect<br/></li><li>25 different formations with their own bonuses to fit your Pins.
