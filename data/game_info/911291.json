We are Team\u00a0Fish!</p>\n<p>Before this project, we had never worked together before. We didn\u2019t even know one another! We found each other through our shared interest in visual storytelling, fangirling over each other\u2019s talent, and wanting to create a Wholesome Game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Though we have grown very fond of Fhinn, his story ends today. We will continue as a team\u00a0 (with two new members!) but have chosen to start a new project, focusing on mythology and fairy tales.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Take a moment to cosy up by playing MoonTales. Let the beautiful environment completely immerse you and let yourself get carried away by the music... Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:58:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/3785dc6627d3f38bdc8ae899c98ce2b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["emfiniteart", "DuhCookie", "Lelahandco", "Kim Hoogeboom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
