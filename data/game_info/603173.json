So it's not totally static.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, the purpose of this to test the functionality.\u00a0 The demo is 3D but it could easily be used in 2D.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nI don't really have a roadmap, but here's what to expect in the future:\r\n<ul><li>Item System<ul><li>Players can open the Item Menu and use consumable items during battle.</li><li>The enemy will be able to do something similar</li></ul></li><li>Unit Swapping<ul><li>Player and AI can swap active unit with others in the party</li></ul></li><li>Multiple Opponents<ul><li>Possibility for 1 v 2,\u00a0 and 2 v 2 Battles.<ul><li>Maybe even Free-for-all Style.</li></ul></li><li>The unit will be able to choose a target to attack.</li><li>Moves will be able to target all/multiple units.</li></ul></li><li>Animations?!<ul><li>I might add some just to make it more entertaining to work on.</li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects?!<ul><li>I'll probably add this for the same reason as the animations.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for checking out this demo!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to support my growth as a developer, I'm accepting donations. Any amount is appreciated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T07:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd28966e6611368b6d64071ed3579feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Veganimus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
