I worked every day on this project, and  within that month I already had the entire town modeled and the main  character modeled, rigged, and animated. Every other character was also  conceptualized and modeled. This part went quickly because I was in my  element.\r\n</p>\n<p>Below are the planned characters. Main character and love interests on top (all boys). Supporting characters on bottom.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>But then I hit a bit of a roadblock when it came time to write the story. I had the general idea in my head for how it was supposed to go, to end, and the characters' personalities. But actually putting all of this into writing is hard, and I'm quite inexperienced. Because of this, writing was very slow, and a bit demotivating. Most of the month was spent only writing very little, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>I did end up being able to create a story structure at least, and enough dialogue for a whopping one (1) cutscene.</p>\n<p>So what we have here is: One cutscene that you can choose to watch, or skip, and the town level to explore.</p>\n\n<p>The story that was supposed to be:</p>\n<p>Amo, the main character, is a homeless herbalist who mysteriously inherits a home in a fishing town. Once arrived, he's quickly accepted into the town, and he starts building relationships there. You would have cutscenes with dialogue options that would change the ending and who Amo ends up romancing, plus a little plot twist.<br/></p>\n<p>(Because the game doesn't go far enough to actually depict Amo's relationships, I added a pride flag on his speech bubble to at least stay within the theme of the Yaoi Jam.)<br/></p><p>Made in Unity, with Adventure Creator.</p><p>All 3D and 2D assets are made by me (except the skybox).<br/></p><p>Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/farland-skies-cl...<br/></p>\n<p>Music: https://www.youtube.com/c/MiddleAgesMusic<br/></p>\n\n<p>I recommend downloading the game, since the web version seems to be of lower quality (like no post processing), plus has some weird camera bug.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Town exploration:<br/></p>\n<p>-You can jump. Don't. Unless you want to go out of bounds, but I didn't hide anything there.</p>\n<p>-Amo will dynamically look at points of interests. It took me 3 days to make it work T_T<br/></p>\n<p>-The house near which you start can be entered.</p>\n<p>-Benches can be sat on. After a few seconds, you can change poses. Every bench offers different scenery.<br/></p>\n<p>-The lamp post near your home passes time.</p>\n<p>-A lamp post near the fountain serves to demonstrate all the character's emotions.</p>\n<p>-There's a wooden tower. You can climb it.</p>\n<p>-Exiting the town from the \"entrance\" exits the game.<br/></p>\n<p>-If you do manage to get out of bounds, note that you can walk on water. Also gg.</p>\n<p>-Some objects have no collision. It's unfortunately intentional.<br/></p>\n<p>-There's a secret in a trashcan.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T15:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e0b5acb24935843f74b794883c8a307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["heathersward"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
