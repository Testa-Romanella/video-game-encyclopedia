Your owner forgot you at\r\nschool! Oh no!\u00a0Better hurry so they can find you!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>///</p>\n<p>A 2D platformer game where a fearful umbrella gets lost from its owner and needs to face its fears to get home, as it glides over desks and faces tons of cranky school supplies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brella will encounter enemy objects who will attack based on their use as tools, forcing the little umbrella to deal with each of them differently. Although Brella is a scaredy-cat, our protagonist can put up a fight--Slap those meanies! Block their attacks! Float over them!</p>\n<p>But, hey, what are those? Droplets! No umbrella can resist a few raindrops here and there... Might as well grab them all on the way!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Go, Brella! Find your way to the lost &amp; found before time runs out and your owner loses you forever!</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys / WASD</strong>: Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Space / \"Z\": </strong>Jump (Press and Hold in the air for a Float + Double Jump combo!)</p>\n<p><strong>\"X\"</strong>: Attack<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"C\"</strong>: Defend<br/></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Engine:\u00a0Unity2019.4.18f1<em>\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0<em>2D</em>\u00a0- Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming:\u00a0Visual Studio</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound:\u00a0</strong><strong>Audacity 2.4.2\u00a0e FL Studio</strong></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong><em>Credits</em></strong>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong>Art</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Daniel Pontes Rolo</strong>\u00a0- Character &amp; Environment\u00a0Designer, and\u00a0Illustrator - Twitter:\u00a0@Proliel\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Bruno Machado</strong></strong> - Programmer &amp; Graphic Designer</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong>Game Design</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Gabriel \"<em>Cyber Twilight</em>\" Medeiros</strong> - Project Management &amp; Technical Game Design - Twitter:\u00a0@CyberTwilight\u00a0</p>\n<p>L<strong>ucas Roza</strong> - Level Design &amp; Game Design - Twitter:\u00a0@CarrozaLion\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programming</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Jorge Obrecht\u00a0</strong>- UI &amp; Structure\u00a0Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Leonardo Santiago</strong> - Systems Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Bruno Machado</strong> -\u00a0Programmer &amp; Graphic Designer\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sound\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Daniel Cavazzote Moreno</strong></strong> - Music, Sound Design, Editing/Revision &amp; Translation- Twitter:\u00a0@TheDCMoreno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T04:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a260eb5a801d1cd5cdfea08813d2d98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyber Twilight", "Carroza"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
