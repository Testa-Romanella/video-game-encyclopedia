Explore the present to uncover the past, in a short story of love and loss and a life well-lived.<br />\nA narrative exploration that examines a world where memories are constantly fading and jumbled. A game about dementia and what happens when you can&#39;t hold onto the things you&#39;ve done or the people you&#39;ve loved.<br />\nBefore I Forget is the debut game by 3-Fold Games and was inspired by the desire to tell stories from perspectives not often represented in games. While creating Before I Forget, the experiences and emotions shared with us by players have been humbling and have driven us to create a game we are proud to share with you.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T23:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d10113ecc394aa612d68b1c8d45f44.jpg", "website": "https://www.3foldgames.uk/", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 28, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Linux", "macOS", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital", "3-Fold Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "3-Fold Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
