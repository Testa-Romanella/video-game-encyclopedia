To show its contempt and superiority, it shall outmaneuver them and their pathetic bullets and reach the Goal Square in all the 100 Levels of this game. The Enemy Squares, turned red, have lots of new tricks to prevent this.</p>\n<p>Dodge all bullets and enemies and reach the goal location in 100 Levels.\u00a0Enemies come in a variety of types, speeds and action patterns. A single hit kills you. Failing a level has no consequences. Though fewer in number, Levels are longer than the previous game.</p>\n\r\nGame Elements\r\n\n<p>You're the Circle.
