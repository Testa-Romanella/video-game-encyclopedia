On top of that, Ema would soon ask her, \u201ccan you help me with my drawings?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Konami thought she would get to look at the new works of her favorite illustrator, what Ema asked from her was quite different. Kissing, bathing together, and sleeping in the same bed were just some of Ema\u2019s requests that left Konami\u2019s heart pounding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cHuh? Help\u2026means k-kissing or sleeping together?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nKonami\u2019s encounters with Ema confused her and made her go back and forth between feelings of admiration and love.
