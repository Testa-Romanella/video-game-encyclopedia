Achieving a full word instantly regains your health and turns your gun into a weapon to DESTROY your foes. Shorter words like \"no\" and \"hot\" are quick ways to replenish lost health, and long words like \"thigh\" are effective weapons against crowds.</p>\n<p>WASD to move, click to attack.</p>\n<p>A few examples from the words list:<br/>- `it` summons Pennywise the clown<br/>- `go` spawns a traffic light<br/>- `no` makes a 'no' symbol<br/>- `ton` is 1,000 lbs<br/>- `hot` creates flames<br/>- `onto` fires sticky bombs<br/>- `noon` acts as a revolver (6 shots)<br/>- `night` fires moons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T06:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fdb536880a93e69de4bd6f5abd93768.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["philliptrudeau"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
