Perhaps. A silly oldschool RPG with dice instead of combat? Definitely.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCaptain Spice and his small band of misfits must embark on a thrilling adventure with their space ship, the Cool Ship, while they try to stop an evil Space Wizard from destroying the galaxy. This game has it all: A duck, dice, NPCs, a guy named Slappy, a very long discussion with a flautist, Simon freaking Tower as an evil villian. What more could you ask for?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpice Pirates in Space: a Retro RPG does not take itself too seriously. It's a fun story that usually can get a few laughs. I made it myself and it is not a AAA game. It costs less than a beer and hopefully you enjoy it almost as much!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/0655e8d6d5100b044592476c563274fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robot Destroyer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robot Destroyer"], "esrb_rating": null}
