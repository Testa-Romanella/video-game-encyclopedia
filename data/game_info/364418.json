It was put together all by myself\u00a0in about 8-10 hours, so it is just a very basic concept and -\u00a0obviously - pretty buggy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game should be seen as a\u00a0Zombie-Survival-Dance-Shooter (because the Jam Theme was \"Unlikely combinations\").\u00a0\u00a0It is just played with the mouse and it has background-music but no sound-effects (because of the short development-time).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goal of the Game:\u00a0keep the Zombie \"alive and dancing\"\u00a0 as long as possible. Therefore you\u00a0 have to shoot down the flying boxes attacking the dancer. Unfortunatly your only weapon is throwing pumpkins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds strange? Well, it is.</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. Since there was no time for optimisations, the game is best played in window-mode and not in fullscreen).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T06:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28af6bf80efec77e1264a6894f388882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wolfs Gamelab"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
