{"id": 379611, "slug": "whimsy", "name": "Whimsy", "name_original": "Whimsy", "description": "<strong>Whimsy</strong> is the story of a girl who has always lived in the forest, however one morning she awakes to find little red footprints outside her door. As any fearless protagonist would, she follows them. They lead her through the forest where she meets new woodland friends (and foes) while solving charming puzzles. The journey is more important than the destination in this game, however the destination is still pretty freaking neat.<br/><br/>A perfect mix between whimsical and macabre, <strong>Whimsy</strong> was created by a one woman/one shihtzu team consisting of Madison Karrh and Buster Brown. I hope this story makes you feel things, I had such a fun time creating it.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Adorable forest creatures<br/></li><li>Puzzles on puzzles on puzzles<br/></li><li>Sweet little tunes crafted for you by Diamond Anaya</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T11:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/443cbd4d86f711e6a1fda6fe557dec41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meatball Parm Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meatball Parm Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
