The puzzle sections are getting upgrades as well with new level objectives, improved balance and better overall feel.<br/><br/><br/>The warm evening air outside is just wonderful, it smells like spring... and par-tay! Your friend Marcelle invites you out to their frat soiree and you are determined to find some good company for the evening. And maybe for the whole night, hmm?<br/><br/><br/>Wow! Elliott you crafty S.O.B! Finally you got brave enough to ask your gorgeous woman out! Ah, what an evening it\u2019s going to be! Candles, piano music, a fancy restaurant. Nothing is able to tear this dream date apart, not a pretty waiter nor the sudden arrival of a long-time-no-see girlfriend. Isn\u2019t it, right?..<br/><br/><br/>\u201cCertainly not, mister! I am here but to clean your chambers!\u201d, she says.<br/>\u201cIs that all you have come here for? What about\u2026 cleaning figurines?\u201d, he replies. <br/>What an insufferable nerd! Anyway, he is so handsome and cute\u2026 Definitely worth a try! Cleaning services are so boring, after all.<br/>She only needs to make her intentions obvious somehow. <br/><br/><br/>Best friends are always concerned for the well-being of their bros! Especially when it\u2019s so devastating to look at both their mutual crush and inability to talk to each other.<br/>Well, there are other ways to kindle a flame of love! Nothing beats a good old poker game. With special spicy punishments at stake, of course. <br/><br/><br/>She is the fierce angel of the ring, the goddess of war, the unapproachable valkyrie, and he is\u2026 well. He is Ricky, just Ricky. He is a fine guy, of course - but is he even good enough for a majestic being like her?<br/>Anyway, it won\u2019t hurt to try to make a move?
