Sadly as the decade came to an end so did your racing career with a horrible crash, not on the track but in your personal life.\u00a0 The years of fast living on an off the track had taken its toll on you.\u00a0 A series of losses, drug abuse and sex scandals and\u00a0 getting old had made you the laughing stock of the F1 world.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You had given the sport up for good, until one afternoon in 1983 drinking in a dirty bar you saw your arch rival Materious Miix giving an interview stating that even in your prime, you would not be able to beat him now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enraged by this you decided to get back in, spending your every last dollar just to be allowed to drive for the smallest team currently in the championship. You were going out with a bang, not a whimper.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Early Atari style racing game, made in Gamemaker.
