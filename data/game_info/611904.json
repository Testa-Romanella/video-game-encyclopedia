It is built in the GameMaker: Studio 2 engine and was made for a college project over 3 months. The current release is more a proof of concept and a demo rather than a full game release!\u00a0\r\nCriticism and feedback is welcomed as we hope to improve this project and keep releasing better versions of it as the development continues on the game.\r\nInsignia is both Keyboard &amp; Mouse supported as well as Gamepad supported! Feel free to leave bug feedback if controls do not work as intended.\r\n\r\nCONTROLSACTIONA / D / LEFT JOYSTICKMOVE<br/>W / SPACE / A GAMEPADJUMPLEFT CLICK /\u00a0 X GAMEPADATTACKRIGHT CLICK / B GAMEPADCASTF / Y GAMEPADINTERACTC /\u00a0SELECT GAMEPADCONTROLSESC / START GAMEPADPAUSE", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e59db137b9b5b005b5c9f972c55dbad4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GmGuru"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
