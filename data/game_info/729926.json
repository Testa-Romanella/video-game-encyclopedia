{"id": 729926, "slug": "bloodpowder", "name": "Bloodpowder", "name_original": "Bloodpowder", "description": "<p>Made for GGJ2022</p>\n<p>The main mechanic of this game is that your health and ammo are the same thing. So you must spend your ammo to avoid dying, but running out of ammo will also kill you.</p>\n<p>You can collect blood off killed enemies.</p>\n<p>The game has a readme.txt</p>\n<p>This game was made in my unfinished game engine (I have no name for it yet), which is a software renderer based on Ken Silverman's build engine. Should remind you of games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3d.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys to walk around (I made sure to think about people with different layouts this time!.. Sorry if you don't have arrow keys)</p>\n<p>M1 to shoot</p>\n<p>Mouse to look around</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>ESC to quit</p>\n<p>There's a display of your ammo and health in the bottom right.</p>\n<p>Sorry about the render texture having a low resolution, and any performance issues you come across. This game is pretty much entirely software, there is barely any GPU\u00a0acceleration because that's how I wanted to design the engine. Also sorry about any graphical glitches you come across, putting it in release mode caused some weird stuff that I didn't have time to debug.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858ffbe2b9c3be7c19f1681e295dd24b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fezezen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
