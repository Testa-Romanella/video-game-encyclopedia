It's always there but never spoken, whether\u00a0in the serials, movies, books and even in some games, most see as timidity,\u00a0whether it is excessive or not... We are talking about Social Phobia or Social Anxiety Disorder.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to bring a little of this day-to-day, showing how difficult it can be to live with it and at the same time extolling its chances of overcoming. For this we bring situations with simple goals for most people, but for the character can be a challenge. We then put a different goal at each stage, to match each place.</p><p>Visit our Facebook page<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/7449cd2e3f2933e9af3d290de202a67b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zephyrum", "AndS", "ahiuexpress"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
