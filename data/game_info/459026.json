The fallback was \"Silence\". We decided to combine these themes with a game about exploring what would have been a crashed space ship on a foreign planet while being pursued by a monster who disturbs the silence of the planet. We didn't get time to do art for the ship or to implement a story telling mechanism into the game\u00a0however, so it plays without this context. Still, it was a lot of fun to make!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T07:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef697af17e892b27bab19b61983c398e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midget_Giraffe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
