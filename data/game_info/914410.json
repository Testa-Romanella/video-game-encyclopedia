To find its way back and\r\n help out the village, it needs to find friends for help\r\n and guidance, but also needs to avoid sea creatures.\r\n                                                                                                                    </p>\n<p>Solve riddles and use your  brightness to let little sparks of light arise even in the darkest part  of the ocean.\u00a0 Get lost in the stunning environments with glowing  corals, listen to the mysterious and wonderful sounds of the ocean and  beware of the monstrous creatures that lurk in the dark. Watch as the  little jellyfish hugs his friends and collects more strength, to get  through even the strongest currents.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T13:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/439c663e8ff4c24dc26dfb82ec897378.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paulini"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
