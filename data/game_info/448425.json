Both players share the same keyboard.<br/></p>\n<p>The first player is a scared scientist and plays with no sound. The second is a blind evil mutant monster and plays with headphones but without visual feedback. The monster has to catch the scientist.</p>\n<p>If the person playing the monster is able to see well enough to read text, we recommend disabling the voice reader in the game options of the main menu.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game we made in 2012  in school (http://enjmin-en.cnam.fr). The game won the jury award and the public award of the JVA during the same year for its accessibility to the visually impaired.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>- Guillaume Saby: programming<br/>- Leev\u00ef Galita: visual art<br/>- Cl\u00e9ment Duquesne and Martin Bussy-P\u00e2ris: game design and audio design</p>\r\nTroubleshooting\r\nPixelated Graphics\r\n<p>If the game looks all pixelated compared to the screenshots on this page, it is most likely because the upscaling feature that comes with the recent versions of Windows is enabled on your machine.</p>\n<p>Here is how to disable it on Windows 10:</p>\n<ol><li>Right-click on the on desktop of the display you are using for the game</li><li>In the context menu that opens, choose <strong>Display Settings<br/></strong></li><li>Under <strong>Scale and layout</strong>, change the value of the first drop-down menu to 100%</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:44:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c4741f9d06538c90308f36122e58e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cl\u00e9ment Duquesne", "Martin Bussy-P\u00e2ris", "Sirithang"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
