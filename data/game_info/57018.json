The title screen of the video game was partially inspired by the 1993 running of the First Union 400 racing event; which occurred on April 18, 1993. The real-life drivers from the mid-1990s are missing because the game only has an ESPN license and not an official NASCAR license.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb7a632253c560e959abb9cd6ec80353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Park Place Productions"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
