If you find yourself searching the same places over and over without much luck, try looking for \"golden\" elements in the garden.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Some objects are more well hidden than others. Feel free to collect as many as you want. You will know when you have found the last one, but the main reward will remain your - hopefully pleasant - time in the garden.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it. This is my first 3D project, so if you play this I would love to read your thoughts.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe68dc76d524d833eca4e78273679b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Findus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
