For Coop - assign friends' controllers in the settings OR play via Remote Play Together. If you like the game, feel free to wishlist it and stay updated for the latest features :)</h3><br/>\u25aa\ufe0f The \"Mood Solution\" corrupted a civilization of sentient mechs, leading them to form hostile fractions based on singular emotion.<br/>\u25aa\ufe0f A small group of not corrupted mechs take up arms to correct the mistakes of the past.<br/>\u25aa\ufe0f Engage in combat with a wide variety of firearms and weapon enhancements.<br/>\u25aa\ufe0f Can you survive this bullet-hell and restore the once-thriving robot society?<br/><br/><br/>Each of the <strong>4 Moods</strong> has its own unique <strong>Abilities </strong>and skill trees to explore during the run. <br/>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f <strong>Pride </strong>is covered by a reflection <strong>Shield</strong>, \ud83d\udc98<strong>Love </strong>conquers enemies to <strong>fight on your side</strong>, \ud83d\udc36<strong>Sorrow </strong>brings the <strong>support mech dog</strong>, and \ud83d\udc7f<strong>Anger</strong> just goes <strong>berserk</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weapons can be heavily altered with <strong>Add-Ins</strong> that enhance certain aspects of your gun or outright <strong>change the way it operates</strong>. Change the bullets' trajectory, add additional effects \u2014 you can even freeze time!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lords of the mech world have gone insane due to the Mood Solution. The only option is to reboot them, but to do so you need to try and defeat them first. Before engaging in battle, choose your dialogue options based on your emotion class. You might not talk them out of the fight, but they could greatly decrease their fighting spirit... or go berserk.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Base Building</strong><br/>Transform barren robot junkyard into a cozy base.
