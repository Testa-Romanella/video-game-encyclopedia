The order the cards come up in will determine the decisions you have to make, the story that you see, and probably the ending that you have!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Card Icon\u00a0Images:\u00a0game-icons.net</p>\n<p>Game Design, Programming, all other images, etc.:\u00a0Matthew Crossley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42bee1b68d7ef8a8bd66a7182a48279f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iMatio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
