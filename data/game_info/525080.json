You have to escape Shrek as you don't know what plans he has for you (they are certainly not pleasant). Can you escape?</p>\n<p>In this horror-themed escape game you have to solve the puzzles and flee from Shrek as he wants to use you for his projects. \"Escape the Shrek\" features a great plot with modern looking graphics. You can explore many different areas and find secrets. You should take this paragraph with humor.</p>\n<p>\"Escape the\u00a0Shrek\" is a game created using the Unity Engine and is the first game my friend and me developed. Major bugs and flaws are to be expected but we still hope this game is enjoyable. This game is being made just for fun, it should have this little flare of a bad game.</p>\n<p>If you want to know what we are currently working on check out this page:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_vp8J7ijgqmx3tKvys13OqA5fvaL6YfZC9PUwBzJs8/...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - Space</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n<p>Show/Hide Crosshair - C</p>\n<p>Show/Hide Timer - T</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Creators:</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Programmer/Game\u00a0Designer/Artist - Nouhi</p>\n<p>Lead Level Designer/3D Designer\u00a0-Slendicon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9da169533ea8b78b5d43d71961f9719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nouhi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
