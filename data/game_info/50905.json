You job is to explore the workshop and find any way possible to ruin christmas once and for all. The elves are extremely hard at work, but working up close to alot of heavy machinery is practically begging for an accident to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe in Speed Potion wanted to spend two months to make a free game, where you can play around with physics and ragdolls. So will there be any bugs? Absolutely! Can you walk through walls? Probably. Can you fall out of the world, for sure. This is a world where you make the most of what you got. Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMake sure to cause as much destruction as possible. Knock-out some elves, pick them up and throw them in \"the Grindeer\". Explore and figure out what goes on behind the scenes, and blow it up! <br/>\r\nHow do you win? You don't. Christmas is forever!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Crazy physics<br/>\r\n- Ragdolls<br/>\r\n- Explosions<br/>\r\n- Cartoon gore<br/>\r\n&amp; some good ol' Christmas spirit!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere's what you need to know:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMove / Navigate menu: \"W\" \"A\" \"S\" \"D\"<br/>\r\nJump / Enter: Spacebar<br/>\r\nDash: L-Shit<br/>\r\nAttack: L-Mouse button<br/>\r\nRagdoll: \"F\"<br/>\r\nGrab: \"E\"<br/>\r\nMenu: \"Esc\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1da5f8b8e39821a5c1dad8bf32d75e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Speed Potion"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Speed Potion"], "esrb_rating": null}
