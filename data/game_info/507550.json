You play as the gnome and must defeat the beasts of the night to save the day. Unlike most gnomes, this is a heavily armed vetran commando gnome, armed with his fishing rod, an umbrella and some fireworks you must defend the light bulb at all costs.\u00a0Your object is simple, stop the monsters of the night from taking the sun. You have an array of weapons to do this with:</p>\r\n* Fishing Rod *\r\n<p>Fish your eneimes from a short distance, the key is to keep out of the enemies attack range.</p>\r\n* Umbrella *\r\n<p>Shield yourself from your enemies for a short period.</p>\r\n* Firework Launcher *\r\n<p>Shoot fireworks at your enimes, they are both a great ranged weapon and make for an amazing light display.</p>\n\n<p>Along with these weapons you are also have a selection of traps to aid in your defense, these can be placed throughout the scene to hurt enemies on their way to the sun. Note they only have a few uses, so keep an eye on them...</p>\r\n* Damaged Extension Cord (Cable Trap) *\r\n<p>Elecucute your enemies! it hurts a lot, but some enemies can take it more than others.</p>\r\n* Disposable BBQ (BBQ Trap)\u00a0*\r\n<p>A disposable fire pit in the hands of a gnome, what could possiblt go wrong? eneimes take consistant damage over these traps.</p>\n\n<p>You'll come across a selection of monsters in the garden centre, be warry of:</p>\r\n* Rats *\r\n<p>Fast &amp; plentyful, rats are the main enemy you'll come across while defending the sun</p>\r\n* Badger,\u00a0Badger, Badger, Badger.....\u00a0*\r\n<p>BADGERS! with catapults??? yep, that's right, they are tanky and deal a lot of damage. Be careful of these enemies.</p>\r\n* The King Bat *\r\n<p>The king bat himself, the tankyiest of the lot and the most annoying to deal with.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Control</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Xbox Controller</strong>Gnome MovementW,A,S,D or Arrow KeysLeft JoystickSwitch Weapon1, 2, 3D-Pad (Left, Down, Right)Use WeaponLeft Mouse ButtonXPlace TrapERBToggle Selected TrapRRTPause GameEscStartPress UI ButtonMouse Over Button (Left Mouse Button)A\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Name</strong><strong>Role</strong><strong>Portfolios</strong><strong>Discord</strong>Jonathan CarterProgrammer (Gnome, Traps, Abilities, UI,\u00a0Menu, Animations, Audio)https://jonathan.carter.gamesJ,#4800Alex StathamProgrammer (Enemies, Spawners, Level) &amp; 3D Art (Enviroment)https://alexstatham.artstation.comDancing Twix#4551Meriel Green3D Artist (Character, Enemies, Enviroment)https://www.artstation.com/merielgreenVit#6003Stuart HoneymanMusic &amp; SFXhttps://youtu.be/AH_fqvpS0Y4Stu#9458\r\n\n<p>Link to our Github for this project:\u00a0<br/>https://github.com/JonathanMCarter/GJL-Jam2020</p>\n\n<p>As per the jam rules, below is a list of any pre-made assets that were used in this project.\u00a0</p>\r\nAssetLinkCreatorAudio Manager | CGhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/149123<br/>asset actualyl broke in 2020.1 on the inspector, but parts of its code were used in the project still.Carter Games (Jonathan Carter)Carter Games Utilites Code LibraryN/A (It's just a collection of pre-made script under the namespace CarterGames.Utilities in the project, the full collection is not public yet).Jonathan CarterLight Bulb Iconhttps://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/light-bulb_117997?term=light%20bulb&amp;page=1&amp;po...Icon made by Vectors Market from www.flaticon.com<br/>Flame Iconhttps://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/flame-silhouette-variant_32250?term=flame&amp;pag...Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com<br/>Umbrella Iconhttps://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/umbrella_702454?term=umbrella&amp;page=1&amp;position...Icon made by monkik from www.flaticon.com<br/>Fire Crackle SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/FractalStudios/sounds/363092/FractalStudios from freesound.orgUmbrella Open SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/Hawkeye_Sprout/sounds/469106/Hawkeye_Sprout from freesound.orgElectric Hum SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/jameswrowles/sounds/248217/jameswrowles from freesound.orgElectric Shock SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/FlashTrauma/sounds/398274/FlashTrauma from freesound.orgFirework SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/deleted_user_3544904/sounds/212682/deleted_user_3544904 from freesound.orgMissile SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/nengisuls/sounds/157439/nengisuls from freesound.orgCatapult SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/cetsoundcrew/sounds/521321/cetsoundcrew from freesound.orgStone Footstep SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/laurenmg95/sounds/386692/laurenmg95 from freesound.orgRat Squeak SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/egomassive/sounds/536753/egomassive from freesound.orgBadger Roar SFXhttps://freesound.org/people/mitchanary/sounds/505121/mitchanary from freesound.orgPot Materialhttps://www.blenderkit.com/get-blenderkit/ff6a3774-f4e1-41cc-ac81-66895b4795ee/BlenderKitPaper Materialhttps://www.blenderkit.com/get-blenderkit/749ce26e-ae0b-46c5-ba7c-ef94140fb777/BlenderKitGame Fonthttps://www.dafont.com/hand-drawn-shapes.fontJLH Fonts<strong> from </strong>dafont.comIntro Cutscene Fonthttps://www.dafont.com/draxel.font<strong>Draelent</strong> from dafont.com\r\n<p>The put it mildly, we ran out of time, the game is not fully complete and polished to the level that I would normally submit to game jams.
