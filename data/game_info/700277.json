{"id": 700277, "slug": "who-shall-wander", "name": "Who Shall Wander", "name_original": "Who Shall Wander", "description": "<p>The tablets that hold all the Jewish values have been lost in the desert and they're at risk of being mixed up with the ones for Christian values. It's up to you to preserve the history of Judaism by gathering all of the tablet pieces. Players use the arrow keys to wander the desert and collect the tablet pieces, avoiding the Christian missionaries as they go. On each tablet, they are quizzed on which of the given values is not actually a Jewish value, earning Mitzvah points if they are correct and eventually attempting to reach the promised land.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by one of my least favorite phrases in the current Western lexicon: Judeo- Christian values. We hear this phrase A LOT from politicians trying to justify their beliefs from a religious standpoint, but it is overwhelmingly used by Christians who have no knowledge of how different Jewish beliefs and values actually are. When they say Judeo-Christian, they really just mean Christian but are trying to rope in another religion to strengthen their argument. The goal of \"Who Shall Wander\u201d is to have people reconsider their beliefs of what Jewish values are by explaining some of the many ways that Jewish and Christian values differ while gamifying the process for a fun experience.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb4/eb437fd0c622e99e46d4000cfb4ce3f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
