{"id": 19306, "slug": "serious-sam-the-random-encounter", "name": "Serious Sam: The Random Encounter", "name_original": "Serious Sam: The Random Encounter", "description": "<p>One of three games in the universe of Serious Sam from independent developers. They had the opportunity to create a game in a recognizable setting, and the publisher can promote a new take in the Serius Sam series. The game tries to embrace the action-packed action of the big games but in the RPG genre. Visually it resembles the classic jRPG but plays differently.</p>\n<p>Battles are all also turn-based like in the reference, but by using an object or weapon, the player has to move the main character and hit the enemies, dodging their attacks. As the name implies, the main battles take place after random encounters. The main character can be joined by new characters, at levels you can find new weapons. At the end of each level, the player will face a boss battle. The game quite accurately adheres to the style of the series:  a vast number of enemies appears on the screen simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The game is rather short. The story campaign is only available for solo completion.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2011-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T10:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8ab35c2bd3cf0c700f55521d33047338.jpg", "website": "http://www.serioussam.com", "rating": 2.64, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1528, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 33, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 86, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 86, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Croteam", "Vlambeer"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
