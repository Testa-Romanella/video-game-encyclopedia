With the theme being<strong> joined together</strong> and FF7RI's Ninjustu mechanic interesting me at the same time, I combined the two into a system where you can attach your shuriken to an enemy in order to target them at range to deal weakness damage with the right element. I created a small level with some enemies retooled from other projects to save time. Hopefully the mechanic is fun, feedback is greatly appreciated since I missed out on getting it from the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:13:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc496a8e38cbd60e57e53aa61edffabd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fxy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
