I'm not a great driver or navigator and between us we managed to take a lot of wrong turns and get ourselves lost once or twice.</p>\n<p>This is a short game (2-3 mins) about getting lost but not minding. Sometimes getting lost is just exploring a new area, enjoying what you discover, and realising that you'll probably get there in the end.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Meditations project and will be featured there on the 18th June but you can play it here now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b5e5f41cf4fba99180fc8bfa35eaf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["joebain"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
