Kill the attacking dinosaurs and try to stay alive as long as possible!</p>\n<em>THE STORY</em>\n<p>Nature set a rule, and the dinosaurs went extinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, in the 1980s, rogue research scientists broke that rule, and brought the dinosaurs back. They thought they were above nature. They thought they could make their own rules, like \u201cNo running in the lab,\u201d and \u201cno eating gummy candy near the dino reconstruction experiments.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>But just as they had broken nature\u2019s rule, it wasn\u2019t long before their own rules were broken in turn. For one day, a rogue rogue research scientist was running through the lab with a bag of open gummy candy when they suddenly tripped, causing the colorful gummy candies to fly from the bag and directly into the dino reconstruction experiment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no!\u201d cried the scientist, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d The machine running the experiment made a strange noise, and from the depths of the disturbed device there emerged\u2026a GUMMY DINOSAUR holding a LASER TAG gun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The scientist recoiled in fear, for the dinosaur was not alone. They were many, they were gummy, and they were angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But one little green dino chose to stand against the rest, seeking not vengeance from the lab-coated creators, but answers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are that dinosaur.\u00a0</p>\n<em>MADE YA GAMES</em>\n<em>Programming</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Avineesh \"Avi\" Kompella | avithesun.itch.io\r\n</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<em>Art and Graphics</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Ash Ketchup\u00a0|\u00a0@meashketchup</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Lydia Chamberlain | milk#3000\u00a0</strong>- UI/UX Design\r\n</li><li><strong>donuts#2311</strong></li></ul>\n<em>Other Roles</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Jesse Forgione | Yampy#1994</strong>\u00a0(she/her) - Music and Sound Design\r\n</li><li><strong>Jimmy Pember | entrylevelgames#1462</strong>\u00a0- Writing/Narrative Design\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e34350d1172411199b88865ef883a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AviTheSun", "entrylevelgames", "Yampy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
