The format is a local multiplayer network game in which 5 players take the roles of a ship's bridge crew as seen on Star Trek. Unlike other bridge simulations, Corvette Project focuses on actually story telling. Players' role playing and interacting with their environment in a non-violent way is an essential consideration during the game development. While ship to ship combat is a major part of the \"Fun Factor\", players in v1 will be able to communicate, investigate and use improvisation to interact with the game universe. In future versions players will assume in game personas or characters, who will have in game skills and attributes that will effect the performance of the ship, much like tabletop RPG games.<br/></p><p>In this first single player DEMO prototype, I will be just testing the waters as it were and giving you a taste of the game's environment.<br/></p><p>You will be simulating taking a Star Fleet Helm Operation Exam.<br/></p><p>Hopeful you will enjoy this very short DEMO, if you do PLEASE COMMENT, if you don't PLEASE COMMENT. Your feedback good or bad is vital for my continual development of this title. If I get enough positive feedback on this demo, I will develop another more polished episode.<br/></p><p>Enjoy<br/></p><p>Live Long and Prosper</p><p> </p><p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/55374c1a74e9e0ce61dfd21a3edbf670.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S31StudioReal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
