Apart from the red glowing eyes and the thirst for human blood, they\u2019re quite alright.@dyzzyd was our graphic designer for this Ludum Dare, and his METAL barbarian portraits are all awesome. @remysicality is our sound designer. He likes death metal, pink and unicorns. @desdemone, @pomme and @luveh are our team of ripped (no) writers. They managed not to bite anyone during the jam, and we must praise them for that effort.<br/><br/>We are pleased to introduce you to second Ludum entry, Axe and Roses, in which you play as a bored barbarian who\u2019s trying to find love. You can only date 3 colourful characters for the moment but we may add more in our post-Ludum updates.<br/></p>\n<p>We are very proud of what we\u2019ve done for this jam. This time, we don\u2019t think we have forgotten the fun as much as in our first submission, and we had a lot of fun ourselves coding, writing, drawing it. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c178b56fa16f102fe9e11f7aa3826601.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NtzschBtzsch", "Hippunk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
