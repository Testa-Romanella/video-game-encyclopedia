{"id": 693682, "slug": "questaholic", "name": "Questaholic", "name_original": "Questaholic", "description": "<p>Asset pack from: <strong>Goldmetal BE3 Lecture</strong></p><p>Workaholism, Completionism, Perfectionism: the triad of -isms that seemingly seeks</p>\n<p>to control our lives, searching for each remaining drop of effort at the expense of</p>\n<p>everything else. The more they consume us, the more our work becomes our worth</p>\n<p>and whatever our best efforts may be may never seem good enough as we continue</p>\n<p>reaching for that unattainable high that is always one rung further up the ladder than</p>\n<p>we can reach. The world feels narrower as our vision focuses in on the next task that</p>\n<p>must be done... and the next one... and the next, until the point where at times work</p>\n<p>is all we can see and we feel as if we are dragging ourselves through mud and fire,</p>\n<p>slowing down with each step. We may forget to take care of ourselves, our</p>\n<p>relationships may go neglected, our sleep may be chipped away at for just a few more</p>\n<p>hours of work as we tunnel vision into what begins to feel like life or death. In our</p>\n<p>desire to do it all, we become so bogged down by everything we are doing, that either</p>\n<p>the journey is an unenjoyable struggle through and through, or we become unable to</p>\n<p>attain that goal.</p>\n<p>In Questaholic, we sought to experientially emulate this particular perception of the</p>\n<p>concept \u201cWorkaholism\u201d through the mechanics of the game, while narratively positing</p>\n<p>its solution \u2013 balance. By placing the player into a classic adventure game, the player</p>\n<p>is implicitly told that they should take as many quests as they can, but the mechanics</p>\n<p>tell a different story, slowing down the player as they take on too much baggage at</p>\n<p>once. Each quest, and all of the work that it entails, is its own weight. The narrative</p>\n<p>of the story pushes the player to respect their own limits, to drop some of that</p>\n<p>baggage when it is needed, and to live and work at one\u2019s own pace.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c69046ba5b5ccba0d924ee4b6f775a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stolenlegos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
