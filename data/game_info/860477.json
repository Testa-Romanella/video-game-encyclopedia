Have a creative break and test my game making skills in Unreal Engine.<br/>2. Promote the 'duality' theme through an interesting mechanic.<br/>3. Make something genuine and allow myself to be vulnerable through art.<br/><br/>The game contains deeply personal and political references. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f716800e5f9ade44c9f4cb2f4d2050b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seb Vomvas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
