A short visual novel with light point and click elements.</p>\n<p>After playing, consider filling out the noble\u00a0post-game survey.\u00a0I promise I'll only use the collected data for evil if it seems like a strong financial maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>Action!</p>\n<p>Romance!</p>\n<p>Super Robots!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reviews:</strong></p>\n<p><em>5/10 ...a sensible chuckle.</em></p>\n<p><em>- WoolieVersus</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Before You Pirate (A note from the director):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In lieu of a crowdfunding model, Speed Metal Vimana uses a revolutionary new form of raising money. Instead of paying now and maybe getting something you like in the future, you, the customer, yes, you! Can pay real cash money right now and get\u00a0a complete, fully functional game. The coin harvested from everyone's purchases will provide the means to make a larger and more robust sequel.</p>\n<p>However, payment is optional. If you liked it\u00a0but you're strapped for cash, I don't want your last dollar, just enjoy the damn game. Or, maybe you're flush with cash but hate what you played. Maybe you just hate me personally. It happens with an uncomfortable frequency.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering\u00a0just what I plan to do\u00a0with\u00a0the cash. Most people who earn money making video games squander it on silly things like food, shelter, and medicine for their children.\u00a0Don't worry, my process of transforming money into your future entertainment is and will always be 100% transparent. There are concrete plans for how to wisely allocate any and all funds. The following\u00a0handy guide explains where it all goes:<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>$0.</strong> Oh lord literally nobody bought the damn game. Mother was right about me after all.</em></p>\n<p><strong>$101.\u00a0</strong>This will\u00a0cover the coffee budget for a while. That's the best I can do for you with a hundo.</p>\n<p><strong>$1024.</strong>\u00a0Look, visual novels don't need a AAA budget\u00a0but a thousand bucks\u00a0really doesn't fund another game. Well, no use complaining. No new game, but drinks are on me!</p>\n<p><strong>$4096.\u00a0</strong>This technically isn't enough money, but clearly a bunch of people want episode 02. I'll pony up what I can to get it done.</p>\n<p><strong>$16,384. </strong><strong><em>Episode 02: Bury my Guns at Bullet Bolt Avenue</em></strong>\u00a0funded! Seriously? That many people actually liked this? You want more? Okay, yeah! Let's rock! Development begins with gusto.</p>\n<p><strong>$19,660.08.\u00a0</strong>Episode 02 super funded! Extra cash means more art assets can be created, bigger environments to explore, and more diverging routes. This is the way\u00a0it was meant to be played.</p>\n<p><strong>$55,050.24.</strong> <strong><em>Episode 03: DJ Black Hole VS King Dracula</em></strong>\u00a0funded! Clearly I've struck a nerve in some sort of community. I am both honoured and terrified.\u00a0I don't want to say too much, but episode 03 will be a visual novel and it will have boss battles.\u00a0This is the game you dreamt of as a child, if you were a demon child whose curse was to dream my future. What do you see dancing in your mind's eye? Why do you run from the inevitable, coward?</p>\n<p><strong>$151,388.16.</strong>\u00a0Oh man this is so much money I don't even know anymore.\u00a0English voice acting for all three episodes? Let's do it.\u00a0Russian, Japanese, and\u00a0Esperanto translations, and an animated opening sequence.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>$899,997. </strong>Has anyone ever told you not to quit your day job? This is the opposite of that. Behold my game dev kingdom, and how beautifully the crown sits on my head. I shall endeavor to provide all my subjects with the finest creations to enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0Wait. Is someone funding me just to launder money? Ah, not my problem. Finally, I've got enough money for the game you really wanted: <strong><em>Kinetic Accelerator: Vimana Pinball\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>$3,336,371.</strong>\u00a0Who makes this much money off a small visual novel? How? Why? Aw hell, let's say\u00a0development funded for a\u00a03D Vimana adventure racing game! <strong><em>Rush of the War Gods: Vimana Racing</em></strong>.\u00a0We'll do an open world\u00a0where you can take part in various races, but also drive around, explore the maps, and complete side-quests at your own pace. A\u00a0visual novel with racing segments! That's what the kids want, right? Obviously, you'll be able to transform from car to robot and engage in some beat 'em up action in the middle of the race.\u00a0While we're fantasizing about impossible things, let's say it'll also help you get your life together, pick out stocks to invest in,\u00a0and find you true love.</p>\n<p><strong>$10,009,001.</strong>\u00a0Investments made into a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Revenue used for the creation of a non-profit\u00a0that funds independent games with mecha action until the heat death of the sun. I don't need a ten million dollar mansion, I need more games with robots!</p>\n<p><strong>$300,000,000.</strong> Holy hell I don't know. Don't look at me. Do you have any idea how much money this is? Okay, fine, let's do some sort of multiplayer, VR, mecha combat game. And maybe a ten million dollar mansion while we're at it.</p>\n<p><strong>$10,600,000,000.</strong> We're building a real mecha. Not a 1/1 scale model kit. Not a tank with arms.\u00a0A real goddamn giant robot. This is happening. You can't stop it. It's too late. I have ten billion dollars in cash and I can do whatever I damn well please.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>$100,300,900,867.</strong>\u00a0Using the threat of my mechanical army, force the United Nations to use mecha combat to decide which nations get a position on the Security Council. This is the world I want to live in.</p>\n<p><strong>$100,200,300,400,500.</strong>\u00a0Under my rule, humanity\u00a0begins colonization of the entire solar system. Pluto will be converted into a giant robot named Hades and used to guard us from the growing threats in the wider galaxy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>$346,145,688,248,234,318,</strong><strong>857.99.</strong>\u00a0Over 12,000 years, our sun will be enclosed in a mobile dyson sphere. A digital copy of my brain shall be uploaded into it. Upon awakening I claim the name Maximum Sol Apollo, the Radiant Emperor. I declare myself true sovereign of the milky way galaxy. Friends, earthicans, astrokin, lend me your arms.\u00a0Let us\u00a0march forward into the universe and the all-war.</p>\n<p><strong>$\u221e.</strong> <em>I AM.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T05:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fac89ced414141ef402014aea7b6e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["jsfehler"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
