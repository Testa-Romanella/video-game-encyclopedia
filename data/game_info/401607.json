Paint buckets are spawned randomly as well as hearts if you are damaged. You get a highscore and right now the idea is to get the highest highscore. This was a two day project and I'm just beginning so please leave any criticism, suggestions, or bugs. Please let me know what you think so I can improve on my game design, thanks!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD to mvoe</p><p>Mouse to move paint brush</p><p>Left Click to Paint</p><p>ESC to pause and change volume</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T02:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51a/51ae58971504bcd667337cdb6bed82a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brandvdo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
