They set out to get to the bottom of things, but end up with a bit more than they bargained for...</p>\n<p>The Sixth Sentinel and the Dark Lord is the third game in the RTF Series. You could probably enjoy it as a standalone game, but I do recommend playing the earlier games in the series, too, if you're interested in them after playing this. The tone is a little bit angstier this time around, but there's a good bit of the usual goofiness, too. Overall play time is around an hour and a half.\u00a0I hope you'll enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Made in around 18 days for the third (You)RPGM Game Jam. Please let me know if you find any gamebreaking bugs.</p><p>v1.1 - fixed a cutscene that caused the game to soft lock.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL THANKS TO!!!!!!! Aekashics! For the use of their wonderful side view enemy graphics! I highly recommend checking their stuff out, it's great and it's plentiful.\u00a0https://aekashics.itch.io/aekashics-librarium-librarium-static-batch-megapack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6fde3eb4e488652dd27f3489ff299d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["minkulus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
