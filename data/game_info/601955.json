My main aims with this were to work on game theming - getting the right title/logo/music et.c. for the tone and mood I\u00a0want to set - get nicer looking menus working in general, and to improve my understanding of the Unity animation system. Most of the art used in the 'demo mode' was done for practice before the start of the jam period. Music via Kevin McLoed, full credits in game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/3673f89860644e4470be6c901a5cc498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArcadeEngineer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
