Fly through the air and dodge enemy projectiles while you collect flags to bring back to your base. Collect them all in the shortest amount of time.</p>\n<p>This is an early prototype which is subject to heavy change. I plan to develop an upgrade menu that will allow the player to buy new things such as an air dash or a double jump. I also want to add more levels, and hopefully more things to do.</p>\n\n<p>Music - DavidKBD HexaPuppies Pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T12:48:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a946f3a99f2025d60bb6274e99a6f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VinnyBot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
