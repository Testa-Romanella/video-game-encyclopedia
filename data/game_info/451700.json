His existence is a lonely one considering he spends his remaining time on earth all by himself on his train, The Bullock, that just won't stay together. Oh and the worst part? The train can't even go below 40km/h or it will explode and blow Maurice to bits. Why he chose this life is beyond me.</p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/derailed-6<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://twitter.com/miss_Mien - Artist</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/pietergeusens - Artist</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/VrLaurens - Programmer</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/EmVee01515594 - Programmer\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T02:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e4deca492d61c7ae40aaeb5a9bbb74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["junkfreak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
