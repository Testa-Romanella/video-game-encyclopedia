It is inspired by Mount and Blade Bannerlord, Rust, Sims 3/4, Runescape, Anno 1404 and Tropico 6.<br/><br/>* All art and sound assets are being used as temporary placeholders because it is a work in progress. No copyright infringement is intended.<br/><br/><h3>Multiplayer Dedicated Servers to play together with your friends</h3><br/>Hop on to one of our servers with your friends and build a great castle together! Team up and support each other either in wars or financial help.<h3>Build and decorate your Castle for everyone to stay in</h3><br/>We have a wide variety of functional furniture that you can decorate your interiors, and your people can make use of the furniture too!<h3>Hire villagers to gather materials and work for you</h3><br/>Lazy to do the grinding? Tell your villagers to do it instead! Villagers can level up and become really skilled in their expertise.<h3>Hire mercenaries to protect your town and aid you in battles</h3><br/>You need to protect your people and property. Form an army to protect, or destroy others!<h3>Melee directional combat so you gain more control of your attacks</h3><br/>Bored of the usual generic MMO combat? If you're a fan of Directional Combat, you'll love fighting anyone with a good weapon in hand.<h3>Defend your castle from bandits or players</h3><br/>Having a prized castle attracts bandits and players who want to steal your stuff. Build strategically to fend off your enemies.<br/><br/><br/>My brother and I always wanted to feel like an actual King or Queen of our own empire with real lineages, dine and celebrate together with life-like people, manage a player-driven economy, and fight alongside comrades that we personally know in realistic battles and sieges.<br/><br/>We're really passionate about Coronation and will accept all forms of criticism as we really want to keep learning and  improving both ourselves and the game.<br/><br/><br/>Were you expecting a full roadmap with planned features laid out? We're not going to do that. Instead, we would like to be <strong>directly involved with the community to come up with the next feature to add in the game in our Discord channel, so please join us!</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T03:21:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c9/6c95feda064e3003c88740f9b818f54a.jpg", "website": "https://discord.com/invite/Z6XsSkpSNJ", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twin Sword Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Twin Sword Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
