You can try selling them everything you have, but you'll probably overwhelm them. <strong>The best choice is always to listen to their conversations and figure out what product(s) they're actually\u00a0willing to buy.\u00a0</strong>Remember, less is more.</p>\n\n<p>Only sound effects were not made by me.
