It is so accurate that you need to hold down your breath to get the target in sight!<br/><br/>\u2022 It is both fun and it is really good practice for all Pistol Shooters because it is all about to pull the trigger on right time and it is same in this Simulator, tap to shoot on right time.<br/><br/>\u2022 Manual calibration of Gyroscope and Accelerometer.<br/><br/>\u2022 One rule! Use just one hand like you are holding a real Pistol to get the most practice out of this Simulator.<br/><br/>\u2022 ISSF rules: you have 60 shots, 6 rounds with 10 each. How much score can you get out of 600 available?<br/><br/>Now you can practice anywhere!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25e76f9208cfea2cdae3f60330146a01_WnYTMAH.jpg", "website": "https://targetshootingapp.com/airpistolsimulator/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Deep Scoring", "Eldhaf"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Deep Scoring", "Eldhaf EHF"], "esrb_rating": null}
