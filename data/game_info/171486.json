The player must fire neutralising shots into the sun to hold it back as it tries to expand! But there's a catch - the planets can only shoot neutraliser while in the pink cosmic firing belt.</p>\n<p>Everything in the game was done within the 48h time-frame given:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Art was made using Paint and GIMP</li><li>Music was made in LMMS</li><li>Game Engine used was Game\u00a0Maker 1.4</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to Tim Ruswick\u00a0for hosting this game jam, and to the whole of the\u00a0game dev community.
