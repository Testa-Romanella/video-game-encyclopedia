I drew up a new background for the game's levels and made it connect so when repeated it looks like one big image.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. I created a custom song to play in the background of my game. I used the application Arcade.</p>\n<p>3. I made level three more complex in comparison to the first two levels. In this level, you need to navigate around asteroids to ambush your targets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by: Kristina Malkowski</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T07:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e065faa9c8ca6e26d78fb4982309a82b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kristinamalkowski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
