Fight your way out of the imperial palace and all the way into the heart of Tokyo's red light district where you will encounter the mafioso himself in an intense danmaku battle!</p>\n<p>Originally made for the GMC WHAM No.2 in a week, Super Robot Ninja Girl is Japanese in two ways - design wise, and gameplay wise, being a danmaku/platform shooter hybrid, both genres originating in Japan.
