Allowing some to know more backstory than others.</li></ol>\n<p>Allowing for options of multiple paths. Having an inventory of everything you\u2019ve collected along your way.\u00a0 Possibly a life bar. Triggering certain outcomes by what you\u2019ve previously collected.</p>\n<ol><li>Talk to a priest</li><li>Fight a wolf</li><li>Leave flowers at a grave</li><li>Choose paths</li><li>Fight Boss</li><li>Grab Angel</li><li>Speak with traveler</li></ol>\n<p>While much of the story is still being expanded upon, I hope to add more to it. \u00a0Giving the character a similar good/bad meter was something that I would love to make in the future.\u00a0 Possibly make it a angel/devil meter, haha. \u00a0Much of this inspiration came. from my love for Dante's Inferno. \u00a0Having Dante go through the nine levels of hell, remembering certain moments that had happened to either himself and his wife, while also playing a key role in his current state was interesting. \u00a0Also Stephen King's famous Dark Tower books played a role, as well as movies such as Inception, and Intersteller. \u00a0Many of these play around with memories, their connections they had at a different point in time, time itself, and the natural order of things.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:26:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/407f75af903f886fe59c28347ba932cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["St3althPatchin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
