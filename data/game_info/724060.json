The simulation calculates and displays the orbits of any solar system based upon Newtons Universal Law of Gravitation.  You can fly through the solar system in your spaceship and feel the effects of gravity as you navigate through the solar system.  <br/>\r\nYou can also experiment with creating your own solar system made of planets of any size and orbit.  eg. See of you can create a stable binary star system.  This simulation is designed for use with a 3D Headset such as the Oculus Quest or HTC Vive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/902/902457b43d6811e16b9e1de508a46024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rob Moore"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["NARP"], "esrb_rating": null}
