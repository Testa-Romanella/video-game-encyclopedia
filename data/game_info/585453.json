You can swing around platforms and bars or grapple around a whole city. There's multiple game modes especially coming to the new update v1.4 and v1.5 like Shootout(You have a gun), Tag(You play, well a game of Tag) and the floor is lava race(you have to race to the top against friends to survive and finally black hole(You have to survive a black hole against your friends) These are all the planned game mode but more will come out and all these game modes will of course be played with a grappling hook as i decided that would be very fun\u00a0\u00a0multiplayer is used by dedicated servers meaning people have to host a server and your friends join, if you can't play worth friends there will be some single player maps to swing around in\u00a0. This game is about fast speed and action so if your into that make sure to check out this game.
