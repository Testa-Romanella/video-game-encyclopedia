You get as many lives as you need, restarting from the beginning of the current level. A speedrun would probably take about 30 minutes, but you won't beat it.</p>\n<p>It's nearly impossible to get people to play a game you've made. With that in mind, this is a game that wins when no one plays it. To the game, existence is suffering. The longer you play the game, the more pain it passes on to you in an attempt to make you quit. The game itself is the final boss, and it's you vs the game.\u00a0If you never play it, the game already wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0has everything that makes a game a game: boxes for graphics (programmer art), repeating tones for a soundtrack (programmer music), and basic platforming (programmer programmings). This game has (almost) it all. It's only missing one thing: fun.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll proceeds go toward me making more games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>free soundtrack on soundcloud</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bfb832d2d22f6f15a1d64738676798e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["derekhenkels"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
