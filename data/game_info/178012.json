After awhile, I kind of gave up on it, as it would be close to impossible to get this game to the way I wanted it to be.  If you couldn't tell, it's based off of Minecraft.  Anyways, I actually lost the source code, it was on a flash drive, and I misplaced it about a year ago, so I can't continue updating this even if I wanted to.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD:  Movement.</p><p>'C':  Change current world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/641d5c14edc2e73dbed28008631dc603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IyanTehGamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
