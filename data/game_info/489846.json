Good experience and I am just glad to have completed something. That said, there is plenty of room for improvement. Some of the most notable points:</p>\n<ul><li>There is no layering/depth difference for enemy sprites, which can result in some funny overlap</li><li>The spawning algorithm is still pretty simple</li><li>On a more superficial level, larger variety of enemies and obstacles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a96ac06ab978e2d0377e2aa4693918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fc85057"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
