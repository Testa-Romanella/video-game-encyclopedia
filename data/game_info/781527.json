This time we made a single-player survival game. Nothing fancy, just a a main hero, who has at his disposal a few scarecrows that can place as decoys, and two weapons, a pistol and a machine gun. His mission is to stay alive and complete as many waves of zombies as possible.</p>\n<p>There is only one map featuring a barn, a corn field and some open space. The corn field limits the visibility of the zombies, i.e. decreases their aggro radius making if difficult to find the hero. The hero must kill all zombies in a wave to advance to the next one.\r\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, some power ups will spawn such as scarecrows, health, and ammo. And believe us you will need lots of it.\r\n</p>\n<p>The controls are simple enough, you can move around with the WASD keys, hit left Shift to run faster, you can switch between your two weapons with 1 and 2, you can place scarecrows with the spacebar, you can aim with your mouse and fire with the left mouse button.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck, have fun and don\u2019t forget to share it with your friends!\r\n</p>\n<p>Cheers!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/481cbb5b44c90a41d336fb87a4c798df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["phrapes.org"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
