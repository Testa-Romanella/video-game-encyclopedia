{"id": 340742, "slug": "fire-call", "name": "Fire Call", "name_original": "Fire Call", "description": "<p>Note, use Esc / B to open achievements menu.</p>\n<p>Enter a detailed little pixel art world, where you complete quests for a cast of eccentric characters, all of whom need saving from a monsterous inferno. Awesome pixel art, groovy tunes and great atmosphere all packed into the first demo level. Save Robert Hicks, his family and his numerous pets, most of whom are trapped in their estate's burning greenhouse.</p>\n<p>All you have is your trusty hose, wits and infinitely stretchy arms. Then when you finally think you've done everything, there's also some neat achievements to collect =)</p>\r\nIt's a demo.\r\n<p>The game is ultimately story based, however with only the one available level, most of that story can't be viewed yet. So the game\u00a0was made in less than two weeks for the June/July Jackpot Jam. As it stands, there isn't actually any win or lose conditions, but you can still collect the achievements, save people and do whatever else your heart desires. As for links to the themes, we've got a heatwave, causing fires everywhere. There's also got a juxtaposition of fires burning in a greenhouse. Firefighting is a job done in Summer, so in some way it's a Summer job.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All the art and coding is my own work.\u00a0Huge shoutouts to my\u00a0music guy, Devast8, who made the slick soundtrack. You should totally check out his stuff, he's made lots of great music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also used a handful of sound effects downloaded from Freesound.org. Most of these sounds were edited to match the game feel. The artists responsible for those sounds (in no particular order) are\u00a0pcaeldries,\u00a0SeanSecret, meisterjaan, FreqMan\u00a0and\u00a0Dynamicell. </p>\r\nIf you enjoyed, then why not follow the creator?\r\n<p>That's JUSTCAMH, he's made a heap of other games, and there's more to come. You should also follow the music guy,\u00a0Devast8, he doesn't wanna admit it, but he makes awesome game music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4a1270644bac4038e296fea04edce1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JUSTCAMH"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
