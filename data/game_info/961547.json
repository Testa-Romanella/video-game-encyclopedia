Many deniers claim that genetic mutation was a side effect caused by vaccines developed in a short period of testing and research. However, political activists fight this claim by saying that the genetic mutations of the DK-19 virus are from infected people who, in a negationist position, contracted the virus in an asymptomatic way, stimulating mutations through adverse treatments, such as the use of Chloroquine and Viagra.\"<br/><br/>\"Regardless of the cause of the mutations, the DK-19 virus caused great damage to the bodies of the infected, generating chaos that had long been predicted...\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>ASZG Project is a first-person shooter game with elements of horror, in which you must survive the creatures generated by the harmful DK-19 virus. Explore and survive in a completely devastated, apocalyptic environment, encountering increasingly greater challenges as you progress through this atypical story.<br/><br/>In a single-player campaign, the game will feature dozens of linear levels in large-scale maps with difficulty level increasing as you progress through the game. Face hordes of enemies, explore the environment in search of better weapons and equipment and discover how to advance to the next level.<br/><br/><strong>WARNING: </strong>This game contains flashing lights, visual effects, loud noises and lots of jumpscares, not recommended for highly sensitive persons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T02:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c854de41416c8925e79baaf63f421d6.jpg", "website": "https://blizbr02.wixsite.com/halfmoon", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paulo Sacilotti Junior"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Half Moon Game Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
