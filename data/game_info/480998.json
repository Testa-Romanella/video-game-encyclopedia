Other things got the better of me however, so it's totally unfinished! It looks nice, I'm happy with how the style turned out and I think the gameplay would have been decent and relatively unique. We'll have to see if I can come back to it.</p>\n<p>This was also my first time using TypeScript. And this did not help. I'm very fluent in JavaScript, alongside Closure Compiler,\u00a0and for me TypeScript offered no benefits over my existing workflow.
