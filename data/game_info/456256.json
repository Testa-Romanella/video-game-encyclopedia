The course focused on the Direct X render pipeline and GPU mapping in C++.

For our final project, we used our engine to make a little game experience. This is a stealth style game. Beyond the basic engine implementation, which all students in the course shared, my contribution to this project included: the flashlights (attenuated spotlights) in the pixel shader, and the vignette shader and post-process. I am rebuilding this engine from scratch in another project to include ambient occlusion and to leverage RTX cards for real-time lighting.</p>\n<p>Navigation</p>\n<p>Download and Play</p>\n<p>C++ Sources<br/></p>\n<p>Team</p>\n<p>Tucker Burke<br/>Dennis Slavinky<br/>Ruben Young</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44e/44e4c7d919ce39128b8559bc5fae84ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TuckerBurke"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
