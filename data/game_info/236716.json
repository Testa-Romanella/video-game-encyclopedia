{"id": 236716, "slug": "deadside", "name": "Deadside", "name_original": "Deadside", "description": "\n<br/>\r\nDeadside is a hardcore multiplayer shooter with large open world and wide gameplay possibilities. Deadside gets you into realistic game environment full of hopelessness and despair. It tries to keep balance between the dynamics of the shooter game and the hardcoreness of \u201csurvival\u201d gameplay. The world of the game does not imply the existence of fantastic elements like zombies or anomalies, concentrating the player's attention on realistic aspects of life on the ruins of the dead civilization.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDEADSIDE WORLD<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world of Deadside is vast open spaces full of bushy forests and abandoned settlements. Players will have an area of \u200b\u200babout 225 sq.km., entangled by a network of roads and rivers. To explore such a vast space, both land and water transport are useful - and Deadside offers you to drive them. It also will need to be fueled and repaired. In addition to players, the game world is inhabited by various hostile and friendly NPCs. Going through the forest, you can face a gang of cannibals just about to eat lunch. Or a group of wanderers trying to survive in a hostile environment. The results of these meetings are completely dependent on your decisions and ability to get those decisions to live. Or death.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTRADE and \u201cGREEN ZONES\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAmong endless vast wastelands a wanderer will find places where they can buy bullets, food and chit-chat to the damned victims about life, the universe and everything. Maybe swap a story or two about hunting cannibals. Also, there are private lockers for players in Green Zones where they can keep a limited number of things they use for surviving. Green Zones will be places of trade and communication between players and friendly NPC traders.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBATTLE SYSTEM<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo protect their interests or piss off the other players, about 15 types of firearms and additional equipment (sights, flashlights, etc.) will be available (at the time of early access).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeadside introduces you the realistic ballistics system for small arms, including penetration of various material. When bullet penetrates, for example, the wall of a wooden shed, it will deviate from the original trajectory and will loss its speed as well. The length of the path of the bullet through the material also matter - the bullet entered obstacle with acute angle will lose much more of its energy and may even be stuck within the obstacle. When damaging human or animal, the actual amount of damage will depend on the body part hit and the keenetic energy of the bullet at the moment of hit. Also, shotgun fans will appreciate that every pellet shot out of the barrel will move along an individual trajectory, providing more realistic shotgun shooting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMISSIONS<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's a big world and in order to avoid getting lost and to keep them busy, players can use the map to see where in the world armed bandits are raiding, areas being cleared by security forces remains loyal to the ex-government or cannibals settling in abandoned villages. Anyone can take part in mass combat. It will not be an event with a limited number of players, anyone who wishes can go to the mission sector and affect the outcome of the battle. Battles with participation of NPC and players can continue for hours but the reward will go to the one who can seize the prize loot after the hostile NPC are killed and the opponents represented by real life players are neutralized.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBUILDING and STASHES<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the course of our game development we are planning to create a system of shelters which players will be able to build on their own using a well developed craft system. It is, however, a subject for later discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe also want to offer players the chance to make small stashes in almost any place of the world to keep a few handy things at the ready. The number of such stashes for one player will be limited.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T17:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bc7e4243bdda9fce00bcdea7c340f5.jpg", "website": "http://deadsidegame.com", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 166, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 2, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bad Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bad Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
