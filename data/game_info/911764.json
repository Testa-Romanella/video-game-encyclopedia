The story is told through the eyes of the young men and women of the Gallo family, who range from the ages of 11-24, as they begin to enter into a life of crime.</p>\n<p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you have yet to read the first novel in the series, \u201cCrime Opera: The Butterfly Effect\", it is highly recommended you do so before reading the following spoilers!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The story begins 9 years after The first Crime Opera tale. Xander Gallo is now bitter, alone, and out of control. He is causing problems for not only other families within the crime syndicate, but for the younger Gallo members as well. Those who remained behind to continue the family legacy are soon forced to take sides with or against Xander Gallo, while others who have seemingly moved on with their lives are pulled back in against their will.</p>\n<p>Crime Opera is a tale of loyalty and deceit, murder and survival, and both the strength and frailty of familial bonds. This particular novel serves as the second part of a much longer saga, following the Gallos from childhood to old age as they are pitted against the outside forces of the mafia world, and eventually, each other as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As with the previous novel, this installment is divided into four books (24 chapters total).

This series is pretty much an excuse to put those writing skills to use in a semi-professional way, I suppose. I\u2019ve been writing Crime Opera over the last 7 and a half years as a response to the anti-hero fad that\u2019s been so popular as of late, in an attempt to fix what has bothered me about it for so long. I currently work as a financial aid rep at a College, and in my spare time I am either writing these novels, reading, playing video games, or playing guitar with my band (EX-GRAVITUS).\"</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n\r\n<strong>Jaytee Sketch \u2013 Character Artist -</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"A freelance artist with an Economics Degree and an MBA. I have been doing art all of my life, as it\u2019s something I love and enjoy doing as a hobby (which eventually became a job). Now I take it very seriously, doing game assets for indie game studios (like TopHatStudios) which includes backgrounds and sprites for Visual Novels as well as other commission jobs (such as small animations, portraits, and art assets). When I read Sean's trilogy I loved it and thought it deserved to be brought to life as a commercial venture. I feel happy when I can inspire others through my art, and with this project I think I'll manage to do that and more.\"\u00a0\r\nhttps://twitter.com/jtSketch\r\nhttp://jtsketch.tumblr.com/</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Solo Acapello \u2013 Musician -</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Musician with a Master's degree in Music Composition.
