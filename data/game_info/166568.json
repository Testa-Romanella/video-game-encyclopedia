The experience was created by Tom Vmt, who believes that the shape carries great spiritual significance.</p><p>\"I believe this geometric form holds the key to understand the creation and the mechanics of life. You will see how this form creates fundamental spiral patterns as you can see in black holes or in the structure of our DNA. During the process of creating I was inspired by my own visions and also by the work of the mystic Walter Russell. You can see OCTA as a foretaste that led me to a bigger project that I'm working on now.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99fc57911a8e8f433dd81f6e4d5a2ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oCtA vR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
