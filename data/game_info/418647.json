You play as a small light floating over a desert, collecting smaller lights, which float behind you,\u00a0from nearby shrines.\u00a0For this game I focused a lot more on the visuals, which are heavily inspired by Journey, than the gameplay itself. Sadly, due to issues with monitor vs. game window coordinates, the game can only be run in full screen with a resolution with an aspect ratio equal to your monitors. I will try to fix this later on, if its worth it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/402cec076ddab1d855f408e70f611e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dcash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
