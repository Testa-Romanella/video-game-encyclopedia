Towards the end something happened that\u00a0made both the communication between server and client and the graphics lag a lot. We could\u00a0not find the source of the lag.<em> - The lag was found. It was the lamp image for some reason.</em></p><p><strong> - How to build/run/play your game</strong></p><p> -\u00a0You need python 3 with the pygame and pymunk libraries. It was written for python 3.3 but I\u2019m assuming 3.2 will work. You run 'main.py server' to run the server then connect by running 'main.py client [ipaddress]'. The first person to connect is 'it' and the second person is the runner.</p><p><strong> - Controls, if not discussed inside your game</strong></p><p> - Arrow-keys to move. Space to jump. RightControl to turn invisible-ish.</p><p><strong> - How your game uses the theme, if it's not self-explanatory</strong></p><p> - You are trying to get to the base without your opponent tagging you. You can \u201chide\u201d by\u00a0turning slightly invisible to try and sneak by.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/612/6124abefeccc53659c59b4b3d526fad1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MyFarms Game Jam II"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
