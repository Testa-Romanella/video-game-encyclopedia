It was initially released on the Namco System 22 arcade system board, and later ported to the PlayStation console in 1994. It is the first title in the Ridge Racer series released for arcades and home consoles. The objective is to finish in first place in a series of races. The PlayStation version supports Namco&#39;s NeGcon controller.<br />\nDevelopment took eight months, and the game is based on a trend among Japanese car enthusiasts. The first home version was released in Japan in 1994 as a launch title for the PlayStation; the versions for North America and Europe were released in 1995. It was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best range in 1997, and for the Greatest Hits and Platinum ranges in North America and PAL regions respectively the same year.

Reviewers praised the graphics, audio, drifting mechanics, and arcade-like gameplay, although some were critical of the lack of strong artificial intelligence and multiplayer mode.
