He seeks the one who stole his arm, and you are him. Climb his shifting and time bending tower in this fast-paced, combat focused \"rogue-ish\" game!</p>\n<p>There is a manual in-game with controls, and a general explanation of gameplay.\u00a0In order to open the manual when the game opens, simply press A on your keyboard (or the bottom button on your gamepad) and use the arrows keys to flip through the pages.\u00a0The game supports use of a controller, and I would recommend using one!</p>\n<p>This is a project I've been developing on and off for over a year now and have been having a great time making it! After a few hiatuses and bumps in the road the game has come a really long way. There is still a whole lot of work to do (a ton really), but I thought it would be a good time to release a demo and see if there is any real interest in a game like this.</p>\n<p>If you are at all interested in supporting the development of the full-game, please visit www.patreon.com/paradiseloststudio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c790ad507e8b53c695fd5484d59b720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ParadiseLostDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
