A difference of a few seconds can be fatal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25a0Manipulate air resistance and friction force.<br/>\r\nThere are three levels of air resistance and four levels of friction. Manipulate these two factors in real time to reach the ideal landing point.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25a0Don't let up even for a moment!<br/>\r\nSimply pushing the ball with the piston is not enough to make it land where you want it to. While the ball is flying in the air, you must constantly manipulate the aerodynamic drag to correct the trajectory of the ball.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T09:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe4925a68a725485f5ed4c4b0d6c6b58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kushikuu"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kushikuu"], "esrb_rating": null}
