You'll need it to cross a pit in the map. Miniboss is in level 2.\u00a0 It summons a swarm of 5 flying enemies every time it's hit. there's a bug when you hit it with the electro gun, but it's pretty comical so I left it in lol. Check it out if you want :p. It also drops a key upon death that you need to progress in the level.</p>\n\n<p>Level 3 music made by Farhan Parekh</p>\n<p>Lavender UI element made by Farhan Parekh</p>\n<p>MSU Assets used.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for a great semester, guys!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1a42fa05044f207de94f3334be5ca36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["FarhanP"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
