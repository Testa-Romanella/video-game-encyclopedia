All was well, the world at peace. That was until someone started making more! With good intentions, more Enhanced were created in a lab by a genious genetic scientist. However, the formula was not quite right. These new Enhanced were evil beings, their only goal to destroy the planet. Seven of these were stronger than the others, and the weaker gathered to become servants for these seven. The four got wind of this just in time, as their forest had already been taken over. Travel through the world mazes and destroy these evil Enhanced, before they can destroy you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T05:13:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/cae794dc624fd4e863081b742af8a409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MartinJimbobBrockett"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
