I know\u00a0 that it doesn't have music and sound FX (sorry about that), but I just wanted to get this out there. Besides, I'm a lot more adept at storytelling.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made this in Twine. Although, if I ever decide to redo this story or just make a new one then I might use a different program, but I'll see.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a84e911a1669a1d6a9721357123c90f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mental.bloxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
