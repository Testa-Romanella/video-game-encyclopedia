But these contractors will need to be paid, so click on time to Pay them before they quit, or hire foremen on a salary to click the Pay Contractor button for you... and so on.</p>\r\nSolve Earth's trash problem before it gets too hot\r\n<p>Unlock additional technologies as you dispose more trash in order to get ahead of human's increasing wastefulness. Get trash to zero before the planet overheats!</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>I made this game several years ago as a side project, but I've now decided to publish it here.
