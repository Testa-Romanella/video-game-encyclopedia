From the introduction of invasive predators to being sleeked by trophy hunters, the Tasmanian wolf has now gone\u00a0extinct.</li></ul>\n<p>The goal I had while making this game was to spread awareness of the endangerment of animals. Although some great animals no longer walk the earth, it is not to late to save some facing the same danger. It is up to us to save the earth and all of its inhabitants!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Base Code by Michael Baker</p>\n<p>2D Basic Platformer Pack by OArielG on the Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>All other assets were created by Maggie Rembert</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0427b68ed9144b528ddebb2d533f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaggieR1411"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
