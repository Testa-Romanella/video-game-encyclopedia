The title is very strict, as the left key is not usable throughout the game and will result in a restart of the level. It's story based and doing the right thing with challenges and choices determines ending. It is free to play, and depending can take 15 minutes to play through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45f5c152c08633933513ebdd11b94b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Pathe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
