The theme was <strong>\"Joined Together\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>So I went with the idea of having multiple minigames playing at the same time. They are joined together as one !\u00a0I developed\u00a0some action minigames and some weird minigame in the style of Wario Ware, it's a mix !</p>\n<p>Every piece of visual art and most\u00a0coding were made within the jam in 48h by myself. Only the sound effects and music were taken from the web. Speaking of that, here's the credits to author of the amazing song : Cluster Block by <strong>FoxSynergy</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I hope you like it, don't forget to leave a comment :D</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Only the 'WASD' keys, the 'ENTER' key and the left mouse button are needed to play. Their functions varies and are specified within the game !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cffa82b4500616197239df70eb521da3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quentin Delvallet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
