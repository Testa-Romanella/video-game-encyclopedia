For this reason, you should choose your path in life wisely.<br/><br/><strong>You</strong> make your own luck! <br/><br/>Help strangers by solving their given quests and get acquainted with them.

If you are clever enough to do that, the world will be fully open to you! <br/><br/>My royal brother once said:<br/><strong>\"A king is not just a brilliant presenter. He is the result of his actions, decisions and lifestyle.\"</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It was a normal day in the continent of Arvon when suddenly a letter flew into my home. The letter was already scorched and half of it was no longer readable. But there was no mistaking the name of the sender. It came directly from my mother.<br/><br/>M: \u201cDear son, I hope you are doing well.\u201d <br/>S: \"I am really fine! But I\u2019d like to see you again\u2026\"<br/>M: \u201cI have moved to another realm a short while ago.\u201d <br/>S: \"From another realm? She just moved to this realm, why?\"<br/>M: \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re wondering how that came to be? Son, listen to me carefully now. My personal assistant has made an incredible discovery. The [\u2026] is you!\u201d<br/>S: \"What about me? Why is this letter so burnt! I can\u2019t read anything at all from Mother, who I haven\u2019t seen in weeks.\"<br/>M: \u201cYou have to see your brother and [\u2026] confront him.\u201d <br/>S: \"I just don\u2019t get it, what is mother trying to tell me!\"<br/><br/>I ran to my brother in the castle and confronted him. The guards didn\u2019t want to let me in at first, but I managed to sneak into the Hall of Consolation anyway.<br/><br/>S: \u201cBrother! I have received a letter from mother! I have something important to discuss with you!\u201d<br/>B: \u201cIf there isn\u2019t my brother. How did you get in here! Say Squire!\u201d<br/>S: \u201ci got past the guards\u2026\u201d \u2013 B: \u201ci don\u2019t care!\u201d [\u2026]<br/><br/>I escaped from the guards and immediately boarded a train for protection in a neutral city. I took the fastest route across the lake. The times are not particularly good and I probably have to expect very high prices. Once I arrived, I took my first steps in the new city where I will be living from now on.<h3>But where Is my identity card now?</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T03:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb36e41ec557487dcef038f24068acae.jpg", "website": "https://leon-schroeder.net/slimesventure/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leon Schr\u00f6der"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Leon Schr\u00f6der"], "esrb_rating": null}
