The thing did not move, yet I had the feeling that it might at any moment crawl off the throne like a worm and creep toward me. I was paralyzed with terror.</em>\u201d (Carl Jung, c1909)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>The Garden of Horcruxes</em> is a virtual reality sculpture garden inspired by the first dream of psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> videogame series. The environment itself is a psychoanalytic reading of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> dungeons and their respective boss monsters. In Jung\u2019s first (or \u201cphallus\u201d) dream he encounters a towering mound of flesh with one single eye and later describes this as a subterranean God \u201cnot to be named\u201d. This is an Oedipal and phallic figure \u2013 that of the symbolic father of monotheistic\u00a0religions. In the same vein, Link of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> enters numerous subterranean structures to defeat monstrous one-eyed phallic egos that extend and diffract themselves in character and theme onto their domains. These are caricatures of fragile and condemned masculinities who howl in electronic pain when slashed in the eye with a sword, just as one might howl in pain when kicked in the groin. The artist invites you to a floating garden where you can view these diffracted ego monsters \u2013 these \u201chorcruxes\u201d condemned for eternity in a dream-like prison.\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a5060605d263b17b5ed5afc08db4e2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tom Penney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
