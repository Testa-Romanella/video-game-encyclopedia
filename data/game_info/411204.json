It is rough and has a lot of problems. I hope you can look past these and appreciate it for what it is.</strong></p>\n<p>Distance Labs is a 3D First-person platformer inspired by Portal, set in an abandoned lab in another dimension. The game's main gimmick is that the maps can change size and rotate. You must traverse these maps and use those size changes to your advantage, while avoiding death.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The music for this game was made by Sigi, who's a greatly talented musician.
