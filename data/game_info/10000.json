You are one of these immortal beings, once human but now a divinity that seeks power through worship, seeking to guide your faithful in this darkness from the dangers of all sides.<br/><br/>There is much ruin and destruction - wrecks in the battlefield of the gods, but you are yet capable of sculpting planets into hospitable, even lush, wonderlands for your followers. Their temples will exalt you, and in your name, they will launch great fleets to expand your divine empire. You will shield them from the stellar radiation, the envy of their rivals, and much darker entities that lurk between the space of the cosmos. <br/><br/>But mere benevolence is not always enough.<br/><br/>There will be enemies, but you need not rely only upon your posthuman followers to deal with them; the primal forces of the universe are at your disposal. Disrupt the asteroid belts, plunging a hail of destruction upon the entire stellar system of your foes. Kidnap their planets into a pocket universe of our holding, their populations ready to be dealt with at your will. Or simply destroy their suns in artificial supernovas, leaving nothing alive in their wake.<br/><br/>There was a time when such acts would have been thought horrific. But now, as the end of the universe approaches, as the forces of entropy threaten to extinguish all life, light and hope, you must gather what power you can to brace against the incoming horrors of the Black Sun.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Command the power to destroy entire star systems</li><li>Create raw planets and their moons from asteroid belts</li><li>Develop an intricate economy with dozens of resources</li><li>Upgrade and develop your planets with gleaming cities</li><li>Construct powerful fortresses to crush your foes</li><li>Erect monumental temples in your own honor</li><li>Command vast fleets faithful to your godliness</li><li>Duel ancient monsters in the depths of space</li></ul><br/><br/>Gods and Idols is free to download, and free to play.
