The game is currently in early access, and will change drastically over time. The current version of Blood Metal includes the wave-based Siege game mode. New missions, weapons, features, and characters will be released in future updates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blood Metal includes a highly detailed gore system. Every part of the human body is destructible. This includes organs, bones, and muscles. One bullet alone could be the difference between a grazing blow and an absolute thrashing to the chest cavity and the vitals within it. This is all powered by our terminal ballistics simulation which takes into account bullet mass, velocity, tumble, the body part's viscosity, hardness, etc. All of this combines to give you a truly visceral experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Welcome to our own special psychotic paradise.
