The current leader\u00a0Daniel Olafsson has good promises and intentions. He had been the leader of Sweden since the election of Olafsson in 2049. Olafsson had a huge fan base and he was elected as the leader. But his popularity withered with time and it was obvious that something needed to be done. The new leadership was faced with many problems and it became clear that something was going wrong.</em></p>\n<p><em>He started blaming Finland for all the problems they've\u00a0caused the Swedes, eventually invading them. He had a huge army and a small navy. In the first few hours they took over a lot of ground. Finland was starting to lose their territories. They started to attack further into Finland and Finland finally responded  back with a lot of force.</em></p>\n<p><em>Finland started launching unmanned drones for a secret spy mission taking over the secret location where Daniel lives. They had a lot of surveillance equipment in the area and they were very close to the Swedish base.</em></p>\n<p><em>They launched five drones into the skies. They had all sorts of sensors that they could use to monitor the situation and figure out what was going on. It was really good for them when they realized that there was no way to defend themselves from these drones.<br/><br/> In this game you will play as one of these drones and escort convoys helping Finland and ending the war once and for all!</em></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc14\ud835\udc2c:\r\n\r\n<p>Together we made the game: <strong>Drone Operator</strong>. It was for a\u00a0school project!\u00a0The goal was to create and release\u00a0a game for on the itch.io page in eight weeks. We did this with three artists and three developers in total. We used the SCRUM workflow and picked a SCRUM-Master. Everday we had some stand-up's and we used Trello for\u00a0the\u00a0communication and organisation!</p>\n<p>After eight weeks of working on the game, we are very happy with how it turned out. Our idea has come to reality and we as a team are proud of each other and the game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hope you like our game and have some fun while playing it!!</p>\n\r\nArtists:\r\n<p>- Julian Hoogendoorn |\u00a0https://scorpiusx.itch.io/</p>\n<p>- Thobias Meerhof |\u00a0https://getgaijined.itch.io/</p>\n<p>- Dailyn\u00a0Sastropawiro |\u00a0\u00a0https://dailynsastro.itch.io/</p>\r\nDevelopers:\r\n<p>- Jeroen van de Geest |\u00a0https://jeroeno-boy.itch.io/\u00a0[<strong>Scrum-Master</strong>]</p>\n<p>- Onne Krol |\u00a0https://ozoonne.itch.io/</p>\n<p>- Scott Gerretsen |\u00a0https://sg-dev.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T17:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3abe75ae39fa7eba61cebbe3df1c5888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeroeno_Boy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
