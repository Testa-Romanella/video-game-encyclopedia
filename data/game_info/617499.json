You have no clue when help will arrive, so the best you can do is defend your cargo and survive the onslaught of hungry blobs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thankfully, your trusty ship is equipped with a state of the art mag-bomb launcher! Just shoot a squishie to implant one inside, then shoot another one of the same color and watch as they hurtle towards each other before exploding! Be careful though, the launcher doesn't recharge until it detects a hit, so make sure to hit your shots! At least you can refuel with the remains the squishes leave behind sometimes!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:50:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/60582d4aa71a7959077abcd057755a43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GloriousToast", "Tamkish", "AnneMarkus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
