This is a fast-paced platformer where you race to get the highest score on the global leaderboard. Each time you play, a random layout is generated! The goal is to remove yourself from the ocean for the betterment of this floating space-rock.\u00a0Tutorial and controls are in-game. All scripts, art, music, animations, UI, audio, and ideas were made by me.</p>\n\n<p>Click\u00a0HERE\u00a0to join my Discord, it's highly encouraged! This is primarily for my indie mobile game, Quadrangle, but you can also talk to me about this game or anything!</p>\n\n<p>Some scripts I got from tutorials and then edited to better fit my needs, and I used LootLocker\u00a0to create the leaderboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d555843eb378f7abc46d919778381a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JSaginario"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
