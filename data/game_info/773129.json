You play an abstract spaceship free to explore strange geometries during a small journey of several levels.</p>\n<p>This is a project semester done in the context of a practical artistic course at EPFL during autumn 2019. The thematic of the project was \"the line\", we tried to explore what can be a line when represented in spaces that deforms our intuitive conception of geometry. We designed this small \"game\" that uses a custom engine to implement a hybrid ray-casting/ray-marching algorithm in order to allow mathematical manipulation of the render.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is to take as an experience or a chill journey/discovery. Don't expect any profound gameplay or hours of fun. Showing it to our friends and family shows that it can take from 5 to 10min to go through all levels. You may finish it in less than a second by abusively pressing SPACE bar, this is however not a race, take your time and enjoy! :)\r\n</p>\n<p>Due to technical limitations, the game is only playable in low resolution and windowed mode (800x600).\r\n</p>\n<p>How to play:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Turn right and left using ARROW keys\r\n</li><li>At any time, when you feel you had enough of a level, you can go to the next one by pressing SPACE bar\r\n</li><li>If you want to quit the game you can press ESC or ALT+F4\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Music must be credited to\u00a0Hinterheim under CC license, check his work on Free Music Archive.
