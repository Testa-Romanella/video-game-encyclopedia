You need to survive whilst scavenging for parts to get yourself rescued!</p><p>Developed on Ubuntu 15.10 with the experimental Linux build of Unity3D. Developed on Linux for Linux. Do expect bugs and other peculiarities, whether arising from my own mistakes or from bugs within this Unity build (lighting can be problematic).</p><p>Developed and tested on an AMD R9 390 with Mesa 11.1 Open Source drivers. Should work with Nvidia Proprietary drivers and Intel Mesa drivers. Unknown if it will work on Catalyst or not. I did not have time during this one-week development to test performance on older hardware. I'm hoping it's not too heavy.</p><p>In-game you can access the Pause menu by pressing the Escape key on your keyboard! I forgot to mention this in-game. I'm sorry.</p><p>This title was developed in the period of one week (19 October to 26 October 2015) for the first GOL Game Jam! This is also my first game development jam that I have ever been a part of. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149c3366027de525ef73018461d5d41a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Yusuf Ismail Bin Shukor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
