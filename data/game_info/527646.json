I am developer at core. So I did all the scripting but some of the art assets used in this project is from the asset store.\u00a0 I will be linking them below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I couldn't fit the whole project into my schedule. So there are some missing components. I wanted implement a functionality to chests so that when they are delivered to the captain, they give you\u00a0a random gift. I thought it would be good for the theme but what can I do.</p>\n<p>I wanted to explain myself incase the game feels a bit pointless :)</p>\n<p>I love low poly art style. I hope you do too.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>USED ASSETS\u00a0</strong>--------</p>\n<p>SYNTY Pirate &amp; Nature Packages</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5217</p><p>POLARIS - Low Poly Terrain Modelling Toolset<br/><br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/17305</p>\n<p>Pirate Sound\u00a0FX</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/pirate-game-sounds-pack-147...<br/></p>\n<p>8 WAY Movement Anim Set</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-pro-pack-15774...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:38:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/497/497a9dfd7efd3e784baa2145f90f6c17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmetahaydemir"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
