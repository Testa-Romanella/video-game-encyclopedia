Some rooms have obstacles, treasure, travelling merchants, fields, and more.<br/>In battle rooms, fight creatures using an autobattling system or use your pets' skills in real time. Encounter treasure rooms where you can collect loot: money, gems, or items to aid in your travels.

You can also use the clinic to recover their HP if they are injured. Participate in the arena to gain experience and rank up to enter new areas, or go for prize competitions that offer cash and items!

Elemental pets can have special elemental skills that can prove useful for higher level dungeons!<h3>Specialized Pets</h3><br/>Your pets can die T_T But you can use the Laboratory to temporarily freeze or even merge them with other pets!<br/>The Laboratory is also the place to create artifacts. Artifacts can select specific parts of pets and save these characteristics for you to use on existing pets.<br/>For example, you can take the highest stat of a dying pet and convert it into an artifact, and then transfer that stat point into a new pet to immediately get it to a higher level. You can also transfer over skills, passives, and even the breed or element of a pet!<h3>Create Stuff</h3><br/>Own a home, and purchase fixtures for it! You can use cooking fixtures to create boosting food items, or purchase a workbench to create items like nets used for taming.<br/>Collect crafting materials from monster drops and level up in the arena to obtain stronger items that you can craft.
