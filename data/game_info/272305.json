Each player has three different unit types to choose from when trying to amass a force to take on their enemies base. Additionally, whenever a tower is taken by the enemy it instantly becomes part of their territory, thus allowing them to build towers on the plot and summon units on the square of the map on which said plot rests.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------How To Play-----------------------------------</p><p>Everything is done through a series of taps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d3dd443ff804119f19dd4743832c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Christophe Saucier"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
