There are guards and cameras on the way, and if any of them realise  you're there, they'll sound the alarm and it's game over.\r\n</p>\n<p>You  have six special moves you can use to avoid that \u2014 some affect the whole  screen, some you have to aim by holding down the fire button; some are EMP for cameras, others knock out or distract guards.\r\n</p>\n<p>But  each move needs a certain hand of dice \u2014 you can have five dice at a  time and if they're all the same you can use smoke bombs. If your dice  are no good, you have to throw some away and pick up new ones.\r\n</p>\n<p>You  can run past a lot of the enemies if you're fast, but it's a high-risk  strategy, and if you do clear out all the guards and cameras, you can  take time to build a good inventory of dice to carry into the next  level.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the levels go on, there are fewer dice and more enemies. How far can you get?</p>\n<p>(The name is partly a reference to Gunpoint but this game has no guns, and it's partly a reference to Zero Punctuation, since this game contains both Yahtzee and crosshairs.)<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T17:48:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af0a964e3c263b343457f0bb94413c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
