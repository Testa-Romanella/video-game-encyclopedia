This time it stars Phen. The OC of Booma8 turned into a full blown character. It's his game now, and it's about time too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a prequel to the events of Hit Bluky, and is meant to clear a little bit of what is really happening in the series. As such some key elements are stringed between each game. One such thing is the portals that take Bluky from one world to the next has a much greater significance this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The actual game itself is made in RPG Maker. As such, it's an RPG. It is more in line with Final Fantasy rather than Earthbound. It won't be an incredible RPG that'll knock your socks off, but I hope it serves well as a gift to everyone who plays it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac43049c42cc7fa0b73847628b4b70ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["booma8"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
