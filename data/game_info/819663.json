To fight the enemies you roll the die, and the outcome of the roll take effect\u00a0(kinda hard to tell stuff is happening when a roll completes right now, ran out of time to add animations. But trust me, stuff is happening). After an enemy is defeated you get new abilities to add to your die faces. Do you want to build up one die face that will obliterate you enemy?\u00a0Or do you want to spread your abilities to multiple die faces to increase your chances to survive?\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>You take on\u00a0the roll of \"Best Player\"\u00a0and face off against enemies like Vicious Vlad, Bloody Becky, General Jim, and more.\u00a0Survive as long as you can against an endless stream of enemies.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Health is the red heart, and armor is the blue shield. When you win each fight your max health goes up by 5, but watch out, the enemy's health goes up by 10 each fight. Just so you know, you can't heal past your max health, but you can get as much armor as you can roll. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Click the \"Roll\"\u00a0button to roll the die. The thing above the button is definitely a die and not just a bunch of stacked images.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Watch out for what you enemy is planning to do after you roll your die. The enemy always moves after you do, so take them out before they get you.</p>\n\n\n<p>Add new abilities to your die faces after each fight. The abilities happen in the order that they appear on the tooltip if you mouse over the die face.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>You can select 1 upgrade from the 3 available, and you can choose which die face to add it to.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Weird things happen when you add too many abilities to the dice. Don't worry though, everything still works fine. This just shows how good you are at the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Technically the last fight of the game is fight 100. Things get a little weird after fight 100. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d2770f0e47200e25d99a4f5528611583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["XealGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
