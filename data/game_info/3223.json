Toys lie forgotten in the playground, the wind blows quarantine leaflets around the silent churchyard. Down on Appleton\u2019s farm, crops rustle untended. The birds lie where they have fallen.<br />\nStrange voices haunt the radio waves as uncollected washing hangs listlessly on the line. The televisions are tuned to vacant channels. Above it all, the telescopes of the Observatory point out at dead stars and endless darkness. And someone remains behind, to try and unravel the mystery.<br />\nImmerse yourself in a rich, deep adventure from award-winning developer The Chinese Room and investigate the last days of Yaughton Valley. Uncover the traces of the vanished community; discover fragments of events and memories to piece together the mystery of the apocalypse.<br />\nFeaturing a beautiful, detailed open-world and a haunting soundtrack, Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture is non-linear storytelling at its best.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2015-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T19:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c64/c6463b164c3eab0c96e1fad70c8793e5.jpg", "website": "http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/", "rating": 3.34, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 123, "owned": 1638, "beaten": 328, "toplay": 119, "dropped": 168, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 113, "ratings_count": 501, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 504, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "The Chinese Room"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayStation Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
