Though the game is fonctionnal, I had very little time to add concrete content. You may see this version as a PoC.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong> with &lt;A/D&gt; or with directional arrows. People with AZERTY keyboards will probably have to change their keyboard settings to QWERTY, or use the arrows...</li><li>When you reach a zone where you can place a key down,\u00a0<strong>hold down\u00a0</strong>one of the key written above to fill the jauge and put it down. Different keys will have different behaviours.</li><li>When a grey box with choices is displayed, you can\u00a0<strong>use your keyboard</strong> to enter the choice, then confirm with &lt;Return&gt; (or &lt;Enter&gt;).\u00a0</li><li><strong>Whenever a lign of dialog is displayed, you can move to the next one with &lt;Space&gt;. At the en of the level, when your choice has been confirmed, hit &lt;Space&gt; to move to the next level.</strong></li></ul>\r\nNotes and thoughts\r\n<p>I am a one-person team, and only very recently picked up gave devlopment. Doing this project took me 30+ hours on the span of two days and a third (?). It was extremely ambitious to me, especially compared to my last game that was really small. I am very proud of what I did for this jam!</p>\n<p>(By the way because there were a lot of comments on my last game about that... yeah there is no music. I didn't find the time to configure that, I really wanted to squeeze the last bit of content and draw some final sprites, and write some final dialogues. Hope you can forgive me for that!)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing<strong> Key to Heaven</strong>, and see you next time maybe for another game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T04:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2cd8a7706e0528cf4cfdfef6a43a731.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kataraxie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
