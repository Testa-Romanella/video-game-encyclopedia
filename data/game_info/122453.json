{"id": 122453, "slug": "lights-out-itch", "name": "Lights Out (itch)", "name_original": "Lights Out (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Rebecca was having a nice sleepover with her friends when suddenly the power goes out and they are attacked... by a fairy?!</strong></p>\n<p>Play as Rebecca, a young girl trying to find her friends after the power goes out while avoiding a Dullahan in your house on \"official business\". However, as you explore the house with only a back-up generator working, you realize that there is only enough power to light one room at a time! This game has completely custom tilesets and character art as well as 1 ending (and a few changes to the ending if you talk to a certain fairy a lot).</p>\n<p><em>This game was made in under 72 hours for Ludum Dare #39, where the theme was \"Running out of Power\". All art assets, scripting, and writing were done by me, Mikomi Kisomi. This runs on RPG Maker MV.</em></p><p><strong>Twitter\u00a0\u2666\u00a0Discord Server</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As of September 14th, 2017, the post-Ludum Dare build of this game is playable in-browser! There are new tilemaps, more fairies, a much larger map, a puzzle, a harder setting, more art, and a few map position changes (so if you played the LD version, you can play this one and not know where everything is). The version I made for Ludum Dare in 72 hours is avaliable for download.</p>\n<p>Also, there's a fan translation of it into Portuguese! You can play it here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6ed9ca80c177d583777a6f5379b620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mikomi Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
