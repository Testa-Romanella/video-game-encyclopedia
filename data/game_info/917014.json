You play as Earbo, a cute rabbitesque creature trying to escape the same cruel fate as his forefathers, or something like that.<br/></p>\n<p>The gimmick:</p>\n<p>I'd hate to spoil the magic so early, but the\u00a0game uses very little albedo (colour) textures outside of Earbo and white cutouts for the tilemap. The impression of textures and depth actually comes from normal maps, which are used to direct light reactions on the textures and add the illusion of dynamic pixel art.</p>\n<p>The use of lighting also happens to hamper the visibility of the room you inhabit. Earbo has his own limited field of vision, but you'll most likely have to rely on sources of light around you to map out your surroundings. Sometimes they simply illuminate the way to the door, while other times they appear in patterns that create challenges and puzzles; You can use your own FOV to explore the darkness if you want to, you never know what you might find!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move, SPACE to jump. Simply walk up to doors and switches to use them.</p>\n<p>If you topple over, simply jump to prop yourself back up. Earbo topples easily. It's very funny.</p>\n<p><strong>*Game includes minor themes of death and fear*</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0viewership is built for 1080p resolution monitors, weird stuff might happen in irregular resolutions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T07:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f40ca5cd0c537ff38267cc5464232ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScottPatchwork"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
