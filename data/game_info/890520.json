You can see both power-ups on first screenshot from Level 1. First power up looks like scull and if you will touch it, you will loose one life. Second power-up looks like green poisoned chest (it also could be seen on first screenshot), if you will touch it, you will loose significant amount of XP. I guess it should be counted as 4 changes - behaviour and drawing but if not then\u00a03rd change is new unique levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825ff372083f9fd9600192e9e1acd937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["dshh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
