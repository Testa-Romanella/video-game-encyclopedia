Set up your towers by playing pool/billiard/snooker and hope for the best. The two genres in combination are <strong>Tower Defense + Pool</strong>.</p>\n<p>This game was actually done in <strong>48h</strong> due to us wasting the first day trying a different idea and failing miserably. While it\u2019s clearly not finished, I\u2019m rather surprisingly relieved that we actually managed to get something playable out in time! I also got sick the day before Ludum Dare, so this particular time was rather ultra straining on my well being.</p>\n<p>Get the Main Theme Music! </p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>You have to protect your ball (the white one). Your turrets are the other balls on the table. You gain more by killing enough enemies. You have three tries per wave to upgrade your turrets by pocketing them into any pockets that have an arrow indicator. Try to survive as long as you can, and be the best in the leaderboards!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Mouse Left-Button: Click and drag back to charge your launch, release to launch the ball</li><li>WASD / Arrow buttons / Mouse Right-Button: Rotate camera</li><li>ESC: Pause/Reset menu</li></ul>\r\nUpdates (POST)\r\n<ul><li><strong>04/25/2018</strong> - Hopefully fixed a bug breaking the game after a restart, more collision bug fixing, introduced basic boss monsters</li><li><strong>04/24/2018</strong> - Added charge indicator and pause/reset, visual &amp; performance improvements, fixed some collision bugs, minor rebalancing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T02:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7ab99f23761ba81892743e1d0f787ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Devastus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
