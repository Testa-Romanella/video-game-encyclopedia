All the game mechanics and experiences are designed and built with \"co-opness\" in mind.<h3>TELEKINETIC ABILITIES</h3>Playing as K\u00e6ra Scouts, you can telekinetically manipulate each other as well as various objects in the game. Use this power to overcome the obstacles and help each other.<h3>CHALLENGING COMBAT</h3>Study the enemies and coordinate your actions to be victorious in fights. Mistakes are costly, resources are limited.<h3>EXPLORATION AND INVESTIGATION</h3>Your primary goal is to solve the mystery. Observe the surroundings, explore the houses and dungeons, talk to strangers. Find the answers.<h3>PLATFORMING AND PUZZLES</h3>You will need to perform high-precision movements and jumps to traverse the locations. At times, moving forward won't be possible without scratching your head and solving a puzzle.<h3>WANT TO KNOW MORE?
