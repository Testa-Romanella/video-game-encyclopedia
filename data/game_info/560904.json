One phoenix intends to find out. Join Takanashi Kiara in her quest to seduce the tsundereaper Calliope Mori through three DDR-style rhythm games in this rhythm game/dating sim hybrid. Takes about 15 minutes to play, this is my most elaborate shitpost to date. (P.S. I only was able to text this on mac, so if the PC build is messed up let me know).</p>\n<p><strong>The Illusion of Choice</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Go through dates with Calli, picking the right dialogue to win her heart. It doesn't actually change anything, but you do get different interactions depending on what you pick.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bullshit Beatmaps</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Challenge Calli to duels of rhythm and try to survive a gauntlet of terribly designed note patterns. The three songs included are TV sized versions of\u00a0Excuse My Rudeness, But Could You Please RIP?,\u00a0\u00a0Heart Challenger, and\u00a0Live Again. Can you get an S+ rank on all of them? I can't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steamy Ending Scenes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beating a beatmap will allow you to see Kiara's advances pay off, as the tsunderaper slowly gives into this bird's endless barrage of flirting. Enjoy some steamy interactions for clearing these levels! Not really, they're all safe for work.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning:\u00a0</strong>This game does not reflect the actual personalities of the persons/reapers/chickens involved. This is not meant to be taken seriously and is basically a giant elaborate shitpost.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits/Big Ups To:</p>\n<p>Calliope Mori:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Excuse My Rudeness, But Could You Please RIP?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Live Again</p>\n<p>Takanashi Kiara:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heart Challenger</p>\n<p>Sugar Cookie by \ubcc4 \ud5e4\ub294 \ub2e4\ub77d\ubc29 Starry Attic :<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Fulminisctus\u2019 Visual Novel Pack: https://soundcloud.com/fulminisictus/sets/visual-novel-audio-pack\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fireworks: https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</p>\n<p>Background Music</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll Meet You There - Sapajou: https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/?t=27252</p>\n<p>I'll Meet You There by Sapajou https://soundcloud.com/sapajoubeats\r\n</p>\n<p>Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY 3.0\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/</p>\n<p>Wanderlust by Scott Buckley | www.scottbuckley.com.au\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Wow Sound Bittersweet Loop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e700df42aa568f7a180531681464174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jackrockstar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
