I saw a lot of people talking about ideas they wanted to do. I saw soul harvesting and regular farm harvesting were the most popular options. I wanted to\u00a0 do something a little outside of the box. Not to mention, my last two Ludum Dare games were a little silly and childish, I wanted to go for a more ominous vibe this time. </p>\n<p>In Body Harvest, you are a mad scientist. You have an urge to create a monster you can call your own. The villagers don't think you can do it and they call you crazy. Body parts are pretty difficult to come by these days so you have to  harvest body parts from the dead in the local cemetery. Once you harvest all the body parts you need, you can create your, VERY. OWN. MONSTER. <strong>*Cue thunder/lightning and flashing lights*. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>I did the art, programming, animations, and audio from scratch by myself. It was my first time doing pixel art so I bounced around between 16bit and 32bit a lot. Then towards the end of the compo I thought I was running out of time so some art is rushed in high res instead of pixel art ( like the trees and outside of the laboratory ). I wish I had more time to get the animations smooth, but they'll do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are very simple, and the game is pretty short in general. However this turned out to be one of my favorite Ludum Dare entries! I hope you enjoy playing it, as much as I enjoyed making it!<br/></p>\n\n<p>W: Move Up</p>\n\n<p>A: Move Left</p>\n\n<p>S: Move Down</p>\n\n<p>D: Move Right</p>\n\n<p>Enter: Interact <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Things I didn't get around to:</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Better animations, directional animations for each type of movement.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Flash for thunder/lightning in the loading sequence.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Better art for outside, like trees.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Hints/tips for interacting with things, although it's pretty self explanatory it would still be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Rain animation for outside, so you just hear rain but don't see it.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Audio effects for digging and sawing.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Still very glad with what I did in the amount of time I had! Now time to go sleep for 15 hours straight, then i'll come play everybody's games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcb3d0996d7c20777625fbd8cfbfc494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["ForeverTrash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
