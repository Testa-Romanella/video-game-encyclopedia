Try out combinations to maximize your review score! Save money and bet it all on a game to make maximum ROI!<h3>Uses A Real Steam Game Tag Dataset (up to mid-2019)</h3><br/>This game uses a dataset of tags of real Steam games. So the way the system scores you, is based totally on real-world data! It will test your gaming and game development knowledge!<h3>What Is This Game About?</h3><br/>This game is about testing your steam and gaming knowledge! <br/><br/>You are told to make a game with 'X' tag which should receive a review score of Y% and a Return on Investment of Z%<br/><br/>You pick the required X tag, along with other tags that you feel go along well with the X tag. You then decide the development time. Your created game then receives a review score and a Return on Investment(ROI) score. You have to meet the goals set for every level to advance to the next one.<h3>How To Play?</h3><br/>Your <strong>Review Score</strong> is dependent on how closely related or \"correlated\" the tags you select for the game are. Think of it this way. If you are making an FPS then there is a high probability that the game is also Violent. So those two tags have a high correlation. You have to populate a game with highly correlated tags to get higher review scores.<br/><br/>The <strong>Return on Investment</strong> is more complicated. It is dependent on the review score, the number of months the game has been in development, and the tags chosen for the game. So higher the review score and more the number of months the game has been in development, the better the return on investment. However, the tags are chosen also play a role here. Think of it this way. FPS and RPG are common genres. So it is easy to get a high ROI if you choose them and their corresponding tags. However, if you make a 4X Strategy game(which is a niche market) then you might get a lower ROI despite getting better review scores because the popularity of a tag plays a big role. So it is about balancing what tags you select.<br/><br/>So if you are down for the challenge, give this light and breezy game a try.<h3>Steam Achievements and Leaderboards coming soon!</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T00:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46fdf1b33ff5c2bc11d2620ca5fc6b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narcos Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Narcos Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
