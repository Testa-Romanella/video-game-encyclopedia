Some dots provide you with a random powerup that gives you additional hints to make it easier to join future dots together.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>[W][A][S][D]: Move</li><li>[Space]: Use Powerup</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Powerups that you may encounter from time to time:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Zoom out your camera to get a better view of the paper, so that you can see more dots to join.</li><li>Dots are numbered so that you know the order to join the dots together.</li><li>A trail points you towards the correct direction of the next dot\u00a0to join.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>We encourage you to\u00a0share your final drawn picture with the rest of the community by downloading it, and posting it in the comments section!</strong></p>\n<p>Note: If you try to download more than one art piece, some browsers like Chrome may block additional downloads.
