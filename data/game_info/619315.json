Your rig consists of a generator and multiple machines that require power and resources to run and produce things. </p>\n<p>Your generator can only supply a limited amount of energy, so keep an eye on what machines you have running at any given moment. Produce 100 units of the classified product and launch the package in order to win. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Oh, did I mention there were enemies too? Yeah, keep those turrets loaded.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Mouse: Drag connections between machines, click on a connection to destroy it.<br/>Escape: Pause menu<br/></p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Paddy for all of the music and visual assets! Couldn't have done it without you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b68c39733773dd0be89d5f5a6db01512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExoSkull-1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
