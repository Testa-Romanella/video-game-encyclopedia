It is a part of the RPG Maker series and is the seventh game in the set.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Namely, the program allows the user to create any RPG he likes. It consists of three main sections: map editor, database and resources. The scheme for creating the game does not vary from title to title \u2014 one chooses the required map layout, then places the points of interests, initiates events and fills the map with content. In the later stages of developing, the user may track the behavior of the in-game elements using diverse data sets allowing him to change the variables without cutting open the game. </p>\n<h3>Notes and restrictions</h3>\n<p>It is possible to use the game commercially \u2014 for instance, sell and organize the IP around it with no copyrights from the Enterbrain attached. The Maker is limited to only single-player 2D games. Multiple paid DLCs are available each bringing new tiles or characters editor into the title. </p>\n<h3>Ace updates</h3>\n<p>Compared to the original VX, Ace version features minor improvements such as multi-tiles errors fix and new soundtrack options. There was also a problem with the static background in some locations which is also fixed in The Ace.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T16:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18ef77d2a8ed1ddb7f1abf358a3c1ea0.jpg", "website": "http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 1074, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 36, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KADOKAWA"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Degica"], "esrb_rating": null}
