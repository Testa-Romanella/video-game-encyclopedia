{"id": 649754, "slug": "bat-terry-assault", "name": "Bat-Terry Assault", "name_original": "Bat-Terry Assault", "description": "<p>Since he's drunk battery acid every day,\u00a0Terry the cannibal has a variety of strange bat-like powers (or maybe that's just schizophrenia), thus every night, he dresses up as a bat to send people flying with his mystic powerbomb technique... and eats them.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[FLYING].</strong></p>\n<p>Terry can fly through the air with the\u00a0<strong>[</strong><strong>Z Key]</strong>, the more you keep the button pressed, the higher and the longer he'll fly.<br/>\"Z Key\" what do you mean? Maybe you're the one with schizophrenia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[ENERGY].</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Terry can flap his wings to stay in midair five times (but this will decrease by one flap for every human you abduct), and\u00a0returning\u00a0to the ground recharges Terry's energy.<br/>Terry's energy meter displays above his head at all times!</p>\n\n<p><strong>[SOUNDWAVES].</strong></p>\n<p>Because Terry is suffering from glaucoma <strong>SO HE SEES A LOT OF DARK</strong>,\u00a0he's learnt how to produce high frequency sound waves that bounce off walls!<br/>If he manages to collide with the sound wave after it hit a wall, he will collect all the information around him and can know where he is <strong>AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND YOUR VIEW AND SEE LESS BLACK</strong>, but he also doesn't have a very good memory so he has to constantly remind himself where he is with constant echolocation. Doing sp can also tire Terry: be careful not to abuse it in the air!</p>\n<p>On the ground Terry can shoot sound waves on both sides, but in the air he can shoot a total of 6 directions, horizontal and diagonal.\u00a0You just have to indicate which direction you want to produce the soundwave with the [<strong>Arrow Keys </strong><strong>and</strong> the<strong> X Key.]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[HUNTING AND SACKING].</strong></p>\n<p>Also thanks to the fact that these frequencies of the sound waves are highly acute, <strong>if they collide with any human, it will stun them for a small moment;</strong>\u00a0the perfect moment to capture them! Press<strong>\u00a0[Arrow Key </strong><strong>UP </strong>and<strong> X Key</strong> <strong>at the same time</strong> <strong>while not moving]</strong>\u00a0to swing your sack! (fun fact you can use your sack to capture projectiles, like cats or bullets, without a need\u00a0to stun them!)</p>\n\n<p>Capturing\u00a0will cause the\u00a0Terry's max energy to lower, and when Terry can no longer handle the load, his subconscious rejects the idea of simply increasing the weight, disabling him from catching any more humans: stunned or not.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>[POWERBOMB].</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort, pressing [<strong>Arrow Key Down and X Key\u00a0at the same time in the ground]</strong>\u00a0Terry uses the last of his energy to recharge with a deadly powerbomb! When in position, by pressing only<strong>\u00a0[X Key]</strong>\u00a0he'll fly into the skys, falling back down to perform a devastating and mythical powerbomb, turning all the humans you've captured into delicious food!</p>\n\n<p><strong>BE CAREFUL, WHEN YOU FALL, YOU LOSE SOME CONTROL, SO KEEP IN MIND WHERE YOU FALL!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>[SCORE (FOOD!)].</strong><br/></p>\n<p>But be quick, if you take too long that delicious food will be stolen by the mythical creature of despawn times, always lurking on the ground destroying pick-ups in milliseconds!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>-------</strong>One of the things Terry has to watch for to have a successful hunt is!<strong>-------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[NORMAL PEOPLE].</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The perfect size to be destroyed on the pavement, your number one priority when it comes to food. Being somewhat stupid, they will be with their own business and will loose their train of thought\u00a0constantly, monitor them constantly!</p>\n<p><strong>THEY ARE ALSO SO DUMB THAT THEY DON'T CLIMB SLOPES, BUT YOU DO, SO IF THEY HIDE IN SLOPES ASECH THEM AT THE EXIT, BUT ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR AROUND.\u00a0THIS APPLIES TO EVERY ENEMY THAT TRAVELS THROUGH GROND!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>[FAT PEOPLE].</strong></p>\n<p>Those guys are too heavy! No matter how juicy they might look, Terry can't pick them up. Since the chronically\u00a0obese are inhuman, Terry's sound waves will have no effect on them, despite being able to hit them, what a hindrance!</p>\n<p>If you collide with one of an obese person, their fat-scooters will roll you on the ground and <strong>KILL YOU! I</strong>t's better to run out of there, good that they are somewhat slow but deep down they are still human so they are somewhat stupid and they will be with their own business and will change their mind about something constantly, so watch their movements well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[THE ELDERLY].</strong></p>\n<p>They will be constantly looking for your ass, since your high-pitched squeaks screw with their hearing aides,\u00a0so they will throw the first thing they have at their disposal to shut you up, and<strong> KILL YOU!</strong>\u00a0They appear in the windows of apartments.</p>\n\n\n<p>Terry is something famous on the streets so the police are after him! When time runs out, the commissary will vacate right away and come after your ass! So take a good look at the time you have left on the billboard. How convenient that when time is up the</p>\n<p>\u00a0--<strong>----------</strong>streets are free and you can get the hell out of there!<strong>------------</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>[POLICE PERSON].</strong></p>\n<p>Human, but dangerous! he is just like all the other people but he has a gun, so take care of it, they shoot first and ask questions later (Bullets <strong>KILL YOU!!!</strong> btw). they are somewhat stupid and they will be with their own business and will change their mind about something constantly, except for that about shooting to death at your head. so watch their movements well.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>[POLICE VAN].</strong></p>\n<p>Made of metal??!? so it can absorb your soundwaves, but it can't be stunned, somewhat slow, but it can still end your life, and that means it <strong>KILLS YOU!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>[POLICE SNIPER].</strong></p>\n<p>Eagle gaze and steel trigger, perhaps metal. they will constantly search your ass until they look for another position where to do that more effectively, sometimes their judgment will be questionable but they try the best they can, if you are in their sights for too long, they will shoot mercilessly, and see if that shot travels mercilessly! It is advisable to be away from the windows where they are and pay close attention to the sound of their shot if you do not have another, dodge in time or move constantly, or you will die, and that means yeah it <strong>KILLS YOU TOO!!!\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Remember! You can leave the place at any time you want, if you feel that you can not with the police, shelf until the time gets to zero to gtfo\u00a0as soon as possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c9/3c9bee6702e0e8edaa156ea4b859a870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koffy"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
