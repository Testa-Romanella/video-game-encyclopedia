Make use of a variety of power ups throughout the levels and navigate your way through obstacles and enemies unique to each world.</p><p>Each level also contains several hidden Baby Donuts to track down as well as one hidden sweet to find per level and plenty of enemies just waiting to take a bite out of you!</p>Targeted Platforms:<p>iOS and Android!</p><p>PC/Mac. Mac App / Windows .EXE file. (Steam if possible!) </p><p>I'd like to spend a bit longer making the PC versions play best on that platform and re-design it slightly so it doesn't just feel like an upscaled mobile game... This Kickstarter is just focussing on making the mobile versions the best they can be!</p>How to play!<p>In the game you control a Donut using just left and right, it's easy for anyone to start playing as the controls are intuitive and the physics feel realistic in the scope of the game. Each level only lasts a few minutes at maximum.</p><p>The main goal of each level is to collect enough of the baby donuts to open up the exit. Along the way there will be many traps and puzzles to stop this being an easy task! As well as some fun power ups to give the gameplay some variety.</p><p>There will be 7 worlds, each with their own theme. Each world contains three levels, one boss level and one hidden EX level which combines some of the obstacles and power ups introduced in the previous levels, these will be much more challenging, and optional to the completion of the main game. Once all 7 worlds and EX levels have been completed, a special 8th world will be unlocked! </p><p>As well as the ever increasing challenge of the levels, there is also the added replay value of trying to get a better high score to share online, as well as aim for the 100% completion rate which will unlock something very cool!</p><p>As well as the main story mode, there will also be an Arcade mode, which lets the player play through several extra hard levels, you get three lives and have to see how many points you can get before it's Game Over. The high score will be saved locally on the game, and, if playing on iOS, will be uploaded to Game Center so you can compete with other people around the world!</p><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d22/d22d5c8b9a790c4aa72f8b3220a29171.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RetroBreak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
