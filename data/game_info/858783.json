The terrain is generated in real time from a matrix using the principle of the noise of Perlin. C.\u00e0.D: We take 2 different scales with 2 different rotations and interpile the matrix data. <br/></p>\n<p>The rendering of the sea is not optimized, I just applied a texture and the zbuffer does the rest. I would have to improve it using clipping which would avoid depth interference at the Land/Sea limit. Drone graphics are ultra-summal but I think I improve it later, too. <br/></p>\n<p>The drone movement is the results of a calculation taking into account its speed, the power delivered by the reactor and the position of the flap. It is therefore a real simulation. The self-pilot function is a small I.A. very simple. If you pay too low an altitude the drone can crash! <br/></p>\n<p>The game is not finished but we can already have fun driving it and training in making loopings or snacks for example. <br/></p>\n<p>In the code, you will find the most interesting functions, among others: <br/>- billboarding (rendered smoke, clouds and sparks) <br/>- a personalized mylookat function (replaces the OpenGL lookat) <br/>- a display function of a skybox (texture of the skybox found on the net that I modified a little). <br/>- a function returning the exact altitude of the land at a point X, Z.<br/></p>\n<p>All keyboard shortcuts are displayed by pressing \"H\" during the game. Have fun! That's all for the moment.<br/></p>\n<p> The game can be run on Windows 7 or above.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the author of the game: this link\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n    </p>\n<p>The author can also be contacted here: this link<br/></p>\n<p>ZINZIN Drone Racing Project was programmed in\u00a0GFA-BASIC 32.
