It features cute graphics mixed with a strange, fantasy-ish atmosphere akin to Earthbound; although with occasional guro and dirty jokes, giving it a charming unevenness. Most of the main games involve aliens invading the world and attempting to harm humans, with the main party being tasked with saving the earth.</p>\n<p>The main character and their sister Kimiru are shrunken by the mysterious power of a magical book. At that time, the Kisechu, a group of tiny aliens bent on conquering the Earth, appear! The main character&#39;s allies must band together and defeat the six fish-hat leaders of the Kisechu to put a stop to their evil ambitions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T20:48:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/63836551471bc0f3995f183d63ed1b02.jpg", "website": "https://towelket.fandom.com/wiki/Downloads", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
