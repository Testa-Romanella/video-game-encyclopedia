We also added the limitation of implementing a dice as a mechanic and we chose to take advantage of the faces of a dice, as the different faces of the antagonist in the toxic relationship.\u00a0</p>\n<em>Features</em>\n<ul><li>The purpose of the game is to communicate\u00a0a message to society and to give visibility to such an important issue as toxic relationships and machism. In our opinion, it is a problem that is not given as much importance as it should be, but which we should all know a little more about. Therefore, we want to communicate this message and this information through this game.</li><li>This videogame implements the gameplay of the Top Down genre to lose that monotony that really follows the Visual Novel genre videogames.</li></ul>\n<em>How to play</em>\n<p>The game will start with our protagonist taking a walk when suddenly someone who will change her life completely appears. You\u00a0have to interact with the different objects scattered around the map\u00a0and with some characters\u00a0with the \"Space\" key\u00a0in order to reach the end of the story.</p>\n<em>Development team</em>\n<ul><li>Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez\u00a0 - Narrative Designer.
