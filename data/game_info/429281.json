The theme was: \"In the dark\".</p>\n<p>You are a small jellyfish that wants to bring light to the dark world where you live. Eating planktons will give you light and touching plants will make you loose a small amount of light but will help you to fulfil your quest!</p>\n<p>The purpose was to work with lights, that was new for me.\u00a0So, the game is a little weird and very fast to finish. But is cute :D Think of it more as a relaxing experience.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Here is the map if you are having trouble finding your way</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68a99564ab612ca1a9c8752dd4ee7dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Julia Yamamoto"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
