Prince escapes his tower, where he is kept protected by his father, and pursues a mysterious guiding light, which turns out to be Helem, a spirit of Time who promises to help the Prince defeat his enemy.

The player has to confront Ahihud&#39;s sand monsters, collects Elixir to boost his own strength and vitality, and find portals to spirits realm, where Helem&#39;s sisters are to be freed.
