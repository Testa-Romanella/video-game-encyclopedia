Every spin of the wheel matters and behaves the way you would expect from a wheelchair.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Challenging Levels</strong> - No level is impossible, some will just be really difficult.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Highscore Leaderboards</strong> - For self improvement, friendly rivalries and hardcore speedrunners.<br/></p>\n<p>While supporting keyboard, this game should be played using a Gamepad (Xbox, Playstation 4 or Switch Pro controller).</p>\n\n<p>Although free, supporting the prototype through comments, ratings or donations will be a strong incentive to release it in the future as a full game.
