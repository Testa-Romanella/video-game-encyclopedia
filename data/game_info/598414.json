The Augmented Reality feature in the app. Neko is a class project designed by students of Interaction Design. The concept of Neko was based on research collected of Japan's history. We drew inspiration from kawaii culture, robotics and the loneliness crisis. Further in the development of the project, the concept for Neko went from being your everyday robot companion to a robot that focuses on your mental health. A robot companion would ideally be capable of doing a lot, with the pandemic causing a spike in depression it seemed appropriate to start prototyping towards the mental health services Neko can provide.\u00a0One of the ways of providing that help would be through a assessment commonly known as the Beck Depression Inventory. We've modified it quite a bit to make it our own, so it is worth noting\u00a0<strong>to not use this as a legitimate\u00a0way to diagnose yourself.</strong><br/></p>\n\n\r\nVideo of this demo in AR\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nWho is Neko?\r\n\r\n Artificial Pro - Concept Design / 3D / Programming\r\n<p>Portfolio</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n\n\n\n\n\r\nLyndon - UI/UX / Brand Identity / Research\r\n<p>Portfolio</p>\n<p>LinkedIn\r\n</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nJulia - UI/UX / Motion Graphics / Research\r\n<p>Portfolio</p>\n<p>LinkedIn\r\n</p>\n<p>Instagram\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nNeko's Initial\u00a0Concept Video", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T07:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c51df75c0f3a6b369edf2b1ca4fc61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Artificial_pro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
