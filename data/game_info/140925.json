{"id": 140925, "slug": "latitude", "name": "Latitude", "name_original": "Latitude", "description": "<p>Latitude is the result of me getting bored late on Valentine's Day 2017.</p><p>This is a fairly simple infinite sidescrolling platformer; you have power to fly up to other platforms, and each stage is randomly generated (there are unlimited stages). For completing a stage, you get a point... and the map will scroll 10% faster and you have ~10% less power.</p><p>What does that mean? It gets difficult. My high score right now is 30. I might just be bad at the game, or the game gets difficult. I couldn't tell you.</p><p>There are no pause screens, intro screens, whatever, it's just a dive-straight-in sort of game. There are also no images -- everything is rectangles. Each stage has a randomly assigned colour (but can't be black, because that's the background). If you want a pause/intro screen, moan at me in the comments. :&gt;</p><p>There's also no music. I wanted a game I could listen to <em>my</em> music while playing. You should too.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p><p>Press SPACE to fly. Your power resets when you land on a platform. Hit the massive pillar at the end of a stage to move on (you can fly into it).</p><p>If you have any power refills, as shown by the number of white rectangles in the top-left of the screen, you can also hit F to get a boost to your power -- this is especially useful in earlier levels. You gain one refill per level you clear.</p><p><strong>Source</strong><br/></p><p>This project is even open source, at https://github.com/Scratso/Latitude :&gt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfc/dfc1749411deb763354553911b6574e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Damian Heaton"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
