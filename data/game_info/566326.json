The game when reaching the goal is much more tricky than it looks like !<br/></p>\n<p>It's a puzzle platformer game, and on every levels, you will have to guide\u00a0 some color's characters\u00a0to their goal position. Once a characters is well placed, it will activate platforms, traps and many things that will make your way harder to place others colors. Inspired by Zelda's donjons paterns, after finishing a level, you will be proud of you, and I will be too !</p>\n<p>This game is far from being a finished game but that's a prototype developped during my free-time. Have fun !</p>\n<p>Hope you're enjoying it and be sure that I will update many more features with time if you encourage me of! Leave a comment to tell\u00a0me what you think about it, I will do my best to make this game a great game for everyone !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T09:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcd46cb1993a21e2786e45bb9dfca1a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucas \"Shiii-gear\" FERNANDEZ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
