Head into the sky to seek water from storm clouds, bring it back to the islands to restore their supply, and keep the flies at bay by waterlogging them with your water blaster. Don't forget to fuel up, and be careful out there!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Instructions</strong><br/><br/>Keep the islands alive while maintaining your fuel. To keep the islands alive you must drop water off over top of them. Water can be gathered by flying through dark rain clouds up above(fuel and water storage is measured in the bottom left).\u00a0 At some points islands may come under siege from flies, you can take them down by shooting at them with a water blast. If you ever get lost you have a compass overhead that will point you in the direction of either the green, yellow, or pink islands. To refuel, stop at your home base and fly through the flags.<br/><br/><strong>Controls (Controller)</strong></p>\n<p>Left Analog Stick- Steer</p>\n<p>Right Bumper - Speed Up</p>\n<p>Left Bumper - Slow Down</p>\n<p>Bottom Button - Drop Water</p>\n<p>Right\u00a0Button - Shoot<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls (Mouse &amp; Keyboard)</strong></p>\n<p>WASD or Arrows - Steer<br/></p>\n<p>Shift - Speed Up</p>\n<p>Ctrl - Slow Down</p>\n<p>Space - Drop Water</p>\n<p>LMB or \"E\" - Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d48032b3b0168f35ec38c8869bbc025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gumboot"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
