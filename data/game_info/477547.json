However, the main story line is playable from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>Gameplay should take around a half hour, as I can run through it in about 15~20 min. Just don't get lost exploring, lol. I really wish I could have fleshed out the game world more, but it is what it is.</p><p>___<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Website: </strong>http://meike.kimaprince.com<br/><strong>Twitter: </strong>https://twitter.com/MeikeKima</p>\n<p><strong>Like Retro Assets?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Like RPGs?</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b8/5b8a45183078d0b8db696a46d8201616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meike Kima"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
