However, I ran out of time and had to cut some of the more detailed fighting mechanics.</li><li>The default Resolution is 840x480. I had to upscale everything by x10</li><li>The art is all 84x48 scaled up though</li><li>I spent 3 Days on this project.(not including writing this page)</li></ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Things I Learned from this Experience</strong><ul><li>Working with restrictions is a nice change of pace.</li><li>Finding bugs for things that are only bugs because of restrictions is infuriating.</li><li>2color Pixel Art is enjoyable to make. Not worrying about shading.</li><li>How to convert Text Images to Font Files.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Features I wanted to have but had to cut</strong><ul><li>Interiors (every building was to be enter-able)</li><li>Keys and locked areas</li><li>Puzzles (need an item to get to next item)</li><li>More Complex Monster Combat</li><li>Combat outside of phone (zelda style)</li><li>Dialogue options (Every NPC has a name btw)</li><li>Story (it's why some areas are more spooky than others)</li><li>Mini-games.

(use the unstuck feature in the options menu)</li><li>The Ocean's animation broke somewhere. The splashes on the beach work. but they are smooth and the water is suppose to slosh back and forth in a jittered effect.</li><li>The font in some of the Phone stuff is not the same as the UI.<ul><li>The UI uses an actual font version of the sprites provided, but when I was overlaying them on the phone, the sizing would not match up. So I just did my own.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MAP </strong>(in case you need help)</p>\n<p>Check the radar in each zone and you will eventually find all the items.<br/>2 monster fights give you nothing.</p>\r\nHappy Hunting", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac16175af249194b8ca677e48b6cab81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gun Asylem"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
