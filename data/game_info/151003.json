Unfortunately you can't always get from one piece of information to the next in a direct route. Your thoughts just won't cooperate! Keep hopping from one thought to the next and hope you can make it through the meeting.</p><p>This is a very early prototype; I have a lot of ideas for further development of Concentration.
