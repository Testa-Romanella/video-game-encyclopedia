In order to help you figure out what to play the enemy will hint a few of the moves he will make, you can then deduce the opposite.</p>\n<p>In the janken screen, you must use an arrow (up, left or right) to select whether you want to play rock, paper of scissors.</p>\n<p>If one of you wins less janken sets than the other he will lose a life. The first with 0 lives loses.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Meibo : Programming &amp; Animations</li><li>Ashtrail : Art &amp; SFX</li></ul>\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io:\r\n\"Prelude and Action\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\r\nLicence: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T03:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d254892632349a58ad7c4bd18292be02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ashtrail", "Chenipain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
