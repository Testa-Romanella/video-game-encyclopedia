The disease causes irreversible changes in the human body, a person loses his mind and behaves aggressively, like a zombie. Civilization no longer exists, few survivors live in isolation under the protection of the military.<br />\nCities outside the zones are dangerous ruins inhabited by infected people and people who have almost lost humanity.<br />\nHeroes, the smuggler Joel and teenage girl Ellie, are trying to cross the continent, colliding in depopulated cities with all the set of dangers. The game requires hidden actions, the combat capability and the number of ammunition of the heroes are small, and it is best for them to avoid fighting. For most of the game, the player controls Joel, while Ellie and Joel&#39;s other companions are controlled by artificial intelligence.<br />\nThe levels of the game are very extensive, at each level the task is the same - to reach a certain point alive.</p>\n<p>Characters have something like a shotgun pistol, bow and arrow, as well as improvised items - pipes, sticks, baseball bats.<br />\nFrom time to time, it is necessary to solve the problem of perceptiveness.<br />\nArtificial intelligence, which controls opponents, can behave differently depending on the situation.</p>", "metacritic": 95, "released": "2013-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T07:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a5a/a5a7fb8d9cb8063a8b42ee002b410db6.jpg", "website": "http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/", "rating": 4.57, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 270, "owned": 3001, "beaten": 2686, "toplay": 473, "dropped": 190, "playing": 72}, "playtime": 15, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 3047, "suggestions_count": 629, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 3083, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Naughty Dog"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
