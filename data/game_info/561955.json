We discovered coding approximately 2 months ago and instantly fell in love with it.<br/>This is our first real, finished game and we put a lot of work into it (about 50 hours per, including Pixel Art). It's honestly crazy how<br/>much time you can spend if you are really having fun and being dedicated. Especially when considering we had school the whole time. <br/>Thanks to all people helping us out on the Brackeys discord server and special Thanks to loveamongstdadragons, who supported us with the awesome soundtrack and sfx. <br/>We hope you all enjoy the game and we would love to hear your feedback!</p>\n<p>Have a great day and live your life to your fullest (sorry it is 6 am xD)</p>\n<p>Hints: You can move left with \"a\", right with \"d\". Moreover,\u00a0 you are able to jump with \"Space\" and change Characters with \"c\". When you look at the stars you can see how many Changes you have. <br/></p><p>A bed adds one possible change.</p><p>Levers can turn street lanterns on and off.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Spoiler (Our interpretation):\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The main character developed a dissociative personality disorder, because of him not leaving his house for months. One day, his second personality decides to bring him outside and challenge him to get out of his comfort zone. Out of the protagonist's view, it seems impossible, that's why he projects his physical stronger abilities to his different personality. Together they are stronger and create a capable character.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/53504a7c05d7a4cb78390ab4bf2871a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeMixer"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
