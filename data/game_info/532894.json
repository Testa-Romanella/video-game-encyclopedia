Desperate for any thrill, they decide to play amateur detectives and look for the lost property of a grumpy farmer they cross on the way back home. Mistery awaits, as does the undeniable monotony of their now peaceful existence.</p>\n<br/>Features\r\n<ul><li>Tap on the screen to advance the story, make choices and investigate objects. Get dialogue and maybe, only maybe, find clues to progress through the short story.</li><li>Extra stories: Additional content will be added to the game for free through updates.</li><li>Throughout these updates, a spanish translation will be added. Other languages might come down the line too. All of them will be free.</li><li>A 0 dollar budget: No money has gone into coding, drawings, music or sounds.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Despite the cheap budget, amateurish graphics by a solo developer, and mostly comedic story, this is not an ironic visual novel. No offense is aimed towards that genre, but don't be confused and buy this game expecting to date fast food mascots or caricatures of presidents, since there are better suited games for that sort of experience. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df05d831d4184094aedf61abd116f835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["MalditoLanzagranadas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
