Not to mention that your ship is currently crashing towards the ground.</p><p>Use the cursor keys to fire your ships steering rockets to get out of this mess, and use z to switch view and see how close your are to certain doom. The ship'll only let you fire the steering rockets while all loose objects (including you) are at rest. You'll need the key to the main engine to have any hope of landing safely!</p><p>Made during the last weekend of the #LOWREZJAM 2016.
