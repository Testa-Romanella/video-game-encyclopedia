We made this game for Unity lesson in March 2018.<br/></p><p>For design document and designers other projects:\u00a0www.erencaylak.com</p>\n<p>We had one week and i wanted to design this game. We could choose an original game but we had limited time. So i wanted to design funny and playable game and Platoon was just on Nintento. Also it\u2019s mechanics are not so hard for limited time. I wrote the game design document before Yozgod but nothing happened. So it is my first game that i designed. Specially i paid attention to art style and making a replayable game. So i did. </p>\n<p>Except coding all assets are ready asset and i put their source sites down. </p>\n<p>Have Fun!</p>\r\nModels and Animations<br/>www.mixamo.com<br/>www.turbosquid.com<br/>www.cgtrader.com<br/>www.free3d.com<br/>www.archive3d.net<br/><br/>Sounds and Musics<br/>www.freesound.org<br/>www.soundbible.com<br/>www.audioblocks.com<br/>www.youtube.com<br/><br/>Fonts<br/>www.fonts.google.com<br/>www.dafont.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8d9a57cec79186f244bc5acfcb69fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eren \u00c7AYLAK"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
