{"id": 92896, "slug": "hopslide", "name": "HopSlide", "name_original": "HopSlide", "description": "How To Play<p>HopSlide consists of two games. </p><p>In Hop you can explore a large, blue world. There are some platforms to jump on, springs to launch you into the air, a mysterious map room to investigate and two doors (but they don't seem to go anywhere). </p><p>In Slide you can slide some colored blocks around. There are some markings on the blocks (but who cares what those are for). Slide doesn't come with any music so maybe you should leave Hop running in the background. </p><p>Hop and Slide are definitely not connected in any way. </p><br/>How To Really Play<p>Run both games at once. The real game is to discover all the different ways the two games are connected, and in doing so collect the six colored letters. The letters are colored purple, blue, green, yellow, white and red, and their colors should give you some idea of where they are located. </p><p>Because the game is hard and requires a lot of thinking outside the box, I've added some hints below for each of the six letters. </p><p>Made by Daniel Linssen for Ludum Dare 30</p><br/>Hop Controls<p><strong>W </strong>or <strong>Up</strong> \u2014 Jump <br/>A/D or Left/Right \u2014 Move <br/>M \u2014 Mute </p><p><em>Xbox controller is also supported<br/></em></p><br/>Slide Controls<p><strong>Left Click</strong> and <strong>Drag</strong> \u2014 Slide <br/>M \u2014 Mute</p><br/>Help<p>The blue world is just one of many. When two worlds are connected in Slide, you can travel between them in Hop using the exits marked by arrows. </p><p>To erase progress, delete the HopSlide folder in C:\\Users\\<your name=\"\">\\AppData\\Local. </your></p><br/>Hints<p>These hints are here in case you get really stuck.
