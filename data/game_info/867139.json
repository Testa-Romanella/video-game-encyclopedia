All by himself, out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the darkest, densest woods he had ever seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a good thing he had the absolutely amazing 100k lumen flashlight. Though, will he be able to escape this situation? There are numerous paths to success, and even more ways to a painful death!</p>\n<p>* * *<br/></p>\n<p> Tips -\u00a0Use \"T\" when you reach teleportation goal. Initially, it is a good strategy to save travel time, but it will reset when you begin a new game.</p>\n<p>Wax-Boy is incredibly sneaky and quick, but fortunately, he hates bright lights. If you flash your super awesome flashlight directly in his face, it should calm him down for a while. Always pay attention, and you might even want to switch off your lights so your eyes can get used to the darkness.</p>\n<p>Small celebratory item in the main menu becomes available once all endings have been reached! Have Fun!</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Wax-Boy's model design and\u00a0original idea goes to Dr.Galaxie\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T12:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32a8d8d096ce412b4e6c16cad2ce9fa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jivapeira"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
