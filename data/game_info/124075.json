This is our first Ludum Dare, happy to participate!<br/></p>\n<p>Sky Dare it's about an Owl who, in his desire to have wings, challenges the Sky itself for them. Hop on a platform powered by your own will and face all who oppose you!</p>\n<p>The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You stand on the platform and face incoming hordes flying enemies. Every hit you receive takes away bits of the very platform that you are using to fight. Get hit too many times and you won't be able to stay on the air no longer! But worry not, if you are any good at facing your enemies you might just have enough time to repair it (By holding the 'F' key).</p>\n<p>We had to scale down our ideas a bit to be able to submit, but we're still pretty thrilled with the result. Hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it for ya!</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse Click 1 - Shoot</p>\n<p>F - Repair Platform</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e86c930f79fc4cd4fdff0e588a375dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BYFREAKS games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
