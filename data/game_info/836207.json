It took me approximately 25 hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Game is Open Source, you can check it from\u00a0this GitHub link.\u00a0The code has my <em>Label Blocks</em> extension as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE PLAYING</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 This was my first time coding a multiplayer game and I haven't used a Cloud Server system. You have to open Chess twice in your computer to play.\u00a0 You must open both\u00a0clients before connecting, otherwise it might break. One HAS TO BE Host and the other HAS TO BE Client. If the game breaks, you should restart. If you mix them up\u00a0(like hosting twice), game will break and you have to restart BOTH clients.\u00a0I'll fix these and improve the game in future updates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>TO-DOs:</strong></p>\n<p>- Promoting a pawn.</p>\n<p>- Castling.</p>\n<p>- En passant.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T13:02:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/562/56229a0fd0d704226f62d8e7a3ec87be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tzdevil"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
