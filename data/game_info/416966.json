We were tasked with creating a short, 2D, single level game displaying our understanding of level design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has been in development for roughly 3 weeks now, and was my first time experimenting with lighting in a 2D Unity game. I would love to improve on this game in the future, and hopefully create a full experience.</p>\n<p>My game was inspired by other games, such as Pitfall on the Atari 2600, and visually inspired by the SNES games of the past, such as Dragon Quest 5 and 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong></p>\n<p>Music by: <em>i AM esper</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99e09cd6332acfc4343f5d240dc0e7c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Evan Rawl"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
