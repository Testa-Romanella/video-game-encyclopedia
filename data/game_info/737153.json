You will find various items such as weapons, potions and armor to help you get through the increasingly difficult enemies that reside within the caves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you start or join a game you will always begin on floor/difficulty 1. At the end pf floor/difficulty 1, there is a\u00a0small dropdown hole that if you drop down you will go to the next floor/difficulty. <strong>If you die on your adventure, your character is permanently dead.</strong> If you're lucky enough, you can find a room with a rope you can interact with to leave the cave system and save your character with all of your items and stats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To start a game go to the main menu and click the button that says \"Together\" in the center of the screen. There you can either host or join a lobby. To create a lobby simply create a code and put it in the host section, then give your friends the code you put in and they'll enter your game. <strong>Players can only join a new lobby while it is on the first floor, past floor one new players will no longer be able to join.</strong> To join a lobby simply get the code from the host and put it under the join section.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you die to an enemy you will go into a downed state where for a short period of time other players can come and revive you, if your downed bar runs out you will die and permanently lose your character. Falling into spike pits instantly kills you.</p>\n<p>Join our discord!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/TcuQRj4VRM</p>\n<p>Take our survey!</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/82B4YPgeCThrqKYL6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1766f75680aac42015c6149c3fe59b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhostSpartan117", "Spongyfall"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
