You can continue playing after that, but will run into many unfinished areas.</p>\r\n\r\nOverview of changes\r\n<ul><li>Render at 60 FPS using OpenGL, effects are done using shaders instead of CPU-side computation\r\n</li><li>Controller support <ul><li>Switch Pro controller support needs Steam to be active to work correctly\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Indicator of currently selected broom in top left of the screen <ul><li>Swapping between brooms doesn't require using the menu - PgUp/Dwn  and controller shoulder buttons switch between them, 1-4 sets the  current broom directly\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Unopened chest indicator on minimaps on screens you've visited. No  more searching for that one chest in the entire dungeon you missed\r\n</li><li>Minimap shows floor numbers for multi-floor dungeons\r\n</li><li>Return to entrance now returns you to the screen where you entered  the dungeon (most notable in REDCAVE with its multiple entrances)\r\n</li><li>Bugfix: Dust at the edge of water acts more consistently\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n<p>This code and assets are released under the same conditions as the  Anodyne 1 license (found here), we do not claim ownership over the IP.\r\n </p>\n<p>What this means for you as a player is that we expect you to own the original, to support the wonderful people who made this possible\u00a0at Analgesic Productions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5acfc5ed4c2acaeda388fe0e85f405c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PixieCatSupreme", "SephDB"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
