{"id": 858711, "slug": "swordvival-wip", "name": "Swordvival-WIP", "name_original": "Swordvival-WIP", "description": "<p>This is a work in progress inspired by a staff weekly art challenge prompt at Game-U. The assignment that week was to create something sword centered, be it a model, a drawing, a game, so long as swords were the focus it fit the bill.</p>\n<p>I recently purchased the 2D\u00a0Game Dev Bundle from Humble Bundle, but I haven't been able to figure out a solid way to break into that toolbox until now. The prompt helped throw some splotches on the blank canvas and gave me something to sort and filter through the hundreds of sprites, icons, backgrounds/tilesets I found myself with.</p>\n<p>This game and another project that I'm working on that I call Infinitanks are both very similar. There's a seemingly endless number of enemies and you have to defeat them. In that game proximity between the player and the targets is less important and so the movement system in that game prioritizes chaos rather than driving the enemy toward the player. My primary focus in this tech demo was to see if I could create a functional game by piecing together these art assets into usable animated sprites and menus and such. The game is pretty barebones at the moment. There's a level and if you are determined and good enough you could play forever. Eventually I'll add a level mechanic and pick ups and such but I have the basic Start screen and controls menu. And the first level with a reset loop within the game. I hope you enjoy and keep checking back because this is literally just the first 10 hours or so of development.</p>\n\n<p>Note:\u00a0\u00a0As of 9/27/22\u00a0 the fonts on some of the graphics aren't working on Mac based web-browsers. I included MacOS and WindowsOS (32 and 64 bit) executables. If anyone would be so kind as to download and test those (specifically the Mac) I would be grateful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:32:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/628/6281a9dc420dec5c112e20cb6f0f5b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ev1lB0ff1n"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
