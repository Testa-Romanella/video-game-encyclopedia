To play the game, download the rom from here or the NvmU website and run with your VMU emulator of choice. If you are using the Sega Dreamcast Browser you must click the link on the NvmU website, not the link from here, as it contains the correct payload to save the game to your VMU hardware.<br/></p>\n<p>For emulators, I highly recommend ElysianVMU, by Falco Girgis. It supports a stupid number of features (including sound!) and systems, and is currently being maintained.<br/></p>\n<p>Programmed entirely in Sanyo LC86K87\u00a0assembly, NvmU features 1-bit graphics and mono buzzer audio. At 5.5kb this may well be the smallest Yume Nikki Fan Game ever created. In the time it took you to read this paragraph it could already be on your device of choice, so what are you waiting for?</p>\n<p>NvmU features multiple secrets, see if you can find them all.<br/></p>\n<p>Please visit the NvmU Website to find out more information about NvmU. Special thanks goes out to Nyrator, Saturn, Bubsy, and all the people of the DDJ Discord. Without you all this would never come to be.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e933a9ea67a63a231a39f2667d5d051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuresuna"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
