The project uses a webcam to map the viewer\u2019s movements onto a dizzying field of found mass media imagery distorted through multiple layers of analog and digital processing. This playful surface is disrupted by a text collage that generates sentences from short fragments of terms of service agreements, advertising transcripts and online personality surveys. The results of these shuffled texts range from the commonplace and banal to jarring and unsettling variations on the often ignored language that shapes our relationship with new media environments.</p>\n\n<p>Project requires a camera.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b1508e5ebe2bc8ecdca77ab1de8c1d25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearwarp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
