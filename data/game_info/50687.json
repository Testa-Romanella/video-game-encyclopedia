In this adventure, the human race completely destroys the Earth's environment in the near future. We have to abandon it and find a new home in space. After hundreds of years of space travel, we have re-engineered our DNA and artificially evolved into a new form. We jumped through the space singularity and found a new planet to settle down. Many years go by we suddenly realize that we didn't reach a new world but returned to Earth in another time as a different life form, and our ancestors now are predators to us. Several attempts are made to leave Earth which leads back to it. Then, we realize that time is an illusion; our past, present, and future are fused together.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T04:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a9b33bd546ef45f78adfba87f1a86e2.jpg", "website": "http://www.samsara-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 22, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 55, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Virtual and Physical Media Integration Association of Taiwan", "Marker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["4EversGames", "Virtual and Physical Media Integration Association of Taiwan", "Marker"], "esrb_rating": null}
