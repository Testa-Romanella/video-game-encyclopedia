The Playground is an open space for students and educators to spend time before and after classes.\u00a0The space features indoor and outdoor environments where you can join your friends and instructors for conversation and free play with\u00a0interactable games and objects. Play table tennis in the multi-story gymnasium, or hang out on a river\u00a0lined with trees and cozy bonfires.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>WebGL:</em>\u00a0</strong>Use the\u00a0 Mouse to look around the environment. Use the\u00a0Arrow keys to navigate Left and Right through the scene to view the environments\u00a0 that can be explored presently in VR.\u00a0The WebGL build has very limited interactability, but it does provide some insight into the project's development and introduces the user to elements of the VR experience that are immersive with the aid of\u00a0VR hardware (such as the Quest 2 build, which is available for download on this page below).\u00a0\u00a0Click and hold the\u00a0M1 mouse button (default left-click button) to look around the room.\u00a0Use the the directional arrows on your keyboard to move forward, backward, and side to side.\u00a0\u00a0The WebGL build allows individuals with a desktop computer to open the scene and explore the environments that we have created for a Virtual Reality experience. You can walk around the indoor and outdoors spaces, but functionality is limited in the WebGL format.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Quest 2:</em>\u00a0</strong>You spawn inside a home study room.\u00a0Press the \"X\" button on the left controller to open an avatar selection screen and a selection screen for\u00a0the indoor and outdoor playground environments. Choose your avatar, then look to your left and consider which virtual playground you\u00a0would like to join. Each playground can host up to 20 players at a time, which is indicated by the numbers on the lower right corner of each environment's title image. Once the user selects\u00a0a playground they will be asked to <strong>Connect with a Name,\u00a0</strong>then prompted\u00a0to enter a username that will appear\u00a0above their\u00a0avatar. The user enters their preferred username using the hand controls then taps\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Enter</strong> to join the selected playground.\u00a0Alternatively, the user can\u00a0<strong>Connect Anonymously\u00a0</strong>and spawn directly into the selected\u00a0playground.<br/><br/>Once inside the playground the user is free to move around with the Lefthand Thumbstick and\u00a0teleport around the scene using the Righthand Thumbstick. Use the \"A\" and \"X\" buttons on the controllers to pickup objects such as\u00a0the table tennis rackets and yoga balls.\u00a0Use the \"O\" button to quit the application. Find your friends and enjoy some banter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:02:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f09d4e678aae25b2055f63d6832be78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlterLearning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
