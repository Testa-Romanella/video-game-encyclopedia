Use tilt controls to follow the ufo, picking up power-ups as you go, but watch you don't fall...<br/><br/>Eurogamer.net: \"Abduction is incredibly addictive, as anyone who's ever tried a game of its sort before can attest, but with a big world map, unlockables and plenty of characters, it's also got incentives to keep you playing beyond just higher scores. It's wonderfully presented, with bright suns and stars that shine behind the platforms the further up you get, adorable little characters and varied environments. It's superb value for money, too.<br/><br/>9/10\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T08:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52ce892cd8f6789aa55b0dbbe77b32a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Psym Mobile"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
