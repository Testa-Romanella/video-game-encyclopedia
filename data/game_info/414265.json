Once one of you has him tackled and in your grasp, mash the tackle button to hold onto him. Then have your partner in lime (sorry) grab hold with another tackle. Tadaa.</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The player's are supposed to be like twice as fast.</li><li>The tackling works in editor- I promise. If it's having issues, try from...behind.</li><li>Also apparently once you tackle, you can't move anymore.</li><li>The pit is probably gonna run to a corner and then it's basically GG. I\u00a0tried fixing it a lot, even right up till the deadline, but woof couldn't get something I liked-oh well, he's still a cutie!</li><li>Don't look under the map.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><em>I thought I had another day left so I got wild and started messing with things like a madman, only to my horror did I learn that I had 2 hours left, and no amount of CTRL+Z could help me now.
