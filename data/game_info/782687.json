And while it felt quite fun, and my friends loved it,\u00a0I decided to put the test online for free (<em>Perhaps a good way to test the controls for the upcoming game \"I Can't Find Me\"</em>).<br/><br/>No big effort been made in building this massive city, I did only Migrate my \"Hand\" player character from \"I Can't Find Me\" project, and set it as the default player in the Matrix's city, and did very very minor tweaks here and there on the Sample City free demo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Warning, this project is a very demanding one in terms of GPU effort, so be ready to hear a lot of fan kicking in your case. I did test on RTX 3070 as well as RTX3080 and it was alright (still had fans to kick in)<strong>.</strong></p>\r\nMouse &amp; Keyboard:\r\n<p><strong>Move:</strong> WASD + Mouse<br/><strong>Jump:</strong> Space<br/><strong>Walk on walls:</strong> RMB (Hold)<br/></p>\n\r\nGamepad (tested with Xbox + PS4 on PC)\r\n<p><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Left thumbstick<br/><strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0A (X)<br/><strong>Walk on walls:</strong>\u00a0LT (L2)</p>\n\r\nMore about \"I Can't Find Me\"\r\n\r\n\n<p>Have Fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><br/><em>The big city made by Epic for showcasing UE5 and it was not intended to\u00a0reach the top of those high buildings during gameplay.
