What is 'right', and what is 'wrong'? By what standard should we judge each other? What is a justifiable use of power, and who decides? Most of all, who should we entrust to lead our society?</p>\n<p>To help answer these questions, we've created Philosophy On Rails: An Introduction to the Western Canon- a teaching tool and personality enhancement that will teach you about the great minds of history while helping you sharpen your own sense of moral rectitude. We've taken the Trolley Problem- a thought experiment that occupied such great minds as Socrates, Sun Tzu, and Thomas Aquinas (and even some not-so-great ones like Plato and Heidegger)- and put our own modern spin on it. All you have to do is make a simple choice- who gets hit by a trolley, and who lives to get hit by a trolley later? Over a series of (approximately) fifteen simple exercises, you'll develop a keen understanding of history, philosophy, and morality. When you attain the rank of Golden Philosopher King, you'll know everything you need to know about how to solve social problems big and small with the power of philosophy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea1e62b0075f10c310061990b3c51c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mmason"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
