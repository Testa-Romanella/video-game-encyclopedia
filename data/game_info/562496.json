Beep has lost its body and Boop its head. So beep can't interact with things and Boop can't see.</p>\n<p>Help them through the labs in search of new parts to repair themselves!<br/><br/>- This game supports controllers and have been tested with a dualshock 4 on windows.</p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/>- The laser can sometimes trigger objects directly to the right of Boop when spawning \u00a0thereby triggering sensors.<br/>- Falling can sometimes cause the level to re-reload. It doesn't do much except look silly<br/></p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game!</p>\n<p>This game is our first attempt at a game jam and we are pretty happy with the result!<br/>Every asset and every line of code has been made by us.<br/>Graphics and animations were made by <strong>Ida</strong><br/>Code, music and sound was made by <strong>Mathias</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:58:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/5512cbc35f1a05dc7729f34384940891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mrmoeg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
