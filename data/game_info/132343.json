Will you make it through and defeat the king?</p>\n<p>Knight is a fierce fighter who is fast with his blade, and faster with his feet. Trained under a rival\u00a0king's army for 8 years, he decided to turn the tables\u00a0after the king executed his parents, humble bakers, for a mild imbalance in the salt level of his Highness' special loaf. At that point, he grew a liking towards regicide and knew he had found his true calling. Since then, he's been going up and down the country, killing kings as he sees fit, and has never looked back. But there's the one king who rules them all, and he still lives in his grand and thoroughly guarded\u00a0castle. Knight knows it won't be easy, but killing this king will bring him\u00a0ultimate fame.</p>\n<p>Mage is a master of the dark arts; she could summon lightning spells in her sleep. Born with magical abilities, she became an\u00a0outcast in the king's society and resorted to\u00a0lurked in the kingdom's shadows with her parents. Yet one fateful day, they lurked a little too close for comfort. A citizen caught them out\u00a0and alerted the king, who immediately executed both of Mage's parents, with Mage narrowly escaping her own demise. From that point on, she knew she would not stand for the mistreatment of her kind and\u00a0set her mind on hunting down the top dog himself. She didn't\u00a0let anything stop her, and certainly wasn't going to let some\u00a0arrogant Knight mess with her schemes.\u00a0She plans on finding the king first and unleashing her true magical capacity on him, turning him into a frog and then\u00a0exploding him into a million pieces.</p>\n<p>In this pixelated battle for glory, 2 players are required in the local vicinity (Player One uses the keyboard and Player Two uses a controller). Each player controls either the Knight or the Mage, receiving their own abilities and attacks.<br/></p>\n<p>The full title of our game is:</p>\n<p><strong>Knightboy and Magegirl Do the Cool Stuff Together Like Fighting Each Other To The Death And Running Around On Platforms In A Castle With Dungeons And Tables And Also</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>and our team is called:</p>\n<p><strong>Let Mii Dye (Sheep in Minecraft)</strong></p>\n<p>which consists of 3 members:</p><p>David:</p>\n<p>who worked on\u00a0Programming,</p><p>Oscar:</p>\n<p>who worked on\u00a0Character Art and Animation, and</p><p>Joe:</p>\n<p>who worked on\u00a0Environment Art and Music.</p>\n<p>All of the content you see in the game was made entirely within this gamejam's duration.</p>\n\n<p>PS: The game is 78.5MB (unzipped)\u00a0so it is eligible to enter the Special Category: The Tiny Award.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/5328143a8b01eb8a80b267abc9396738.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave22153"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
