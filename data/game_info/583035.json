It was difficult to portray a \u201cLizard Man\u201d or an \u201cIncredible Fella\u201d with 8 bits and with limited colors and space\u00a0 to create. So using dialogue to push through the story and the character was what I had to do. In transitions I tried to use the Japanese transition of using them to establish a mood or sense of place (72). With this thought in mind I used transitions going through the wormhole. Using the wave as a way to give the player a sense of sci-fi travel so when they find their sense of place it transitions a little easier. Or when they go through the cave in the prehistoric era there is quite literally a tunnel effect which worked out perfectly. In using the timestamp method I added \u201cextra panels\u201d in the 80\u2019s to make it feel longer and more adventurous(101). I thought that if each time travel was just one room it wouldn't really seem like the game is traveling through time just traveling to different places. So adding the extra panels or frames in the 80\u2019s to make the player have to actually explore helped with the time stamp.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Watching the theme park videos, the biggest lessons I took away were having a backstory and immersing the user in an environment graphically with the little details. For example if this was some crazy theme park and my last project was a movie. The audience would already have an idea of the story and its sense. The recurring characters like Incredible Fella was a nice call back to immerse the audience in the story/setting. So naturally, when the story takes place in a dungeon and you see Incredible Fella, the scene has pretty much been set. My only regret was to have had more detail on the actual villain of the story or Lizard Man universe. Second was using graphics to fully immerse the audience. One of the ways I did this was by using animations in the tiles like the flames in the dungeon. Also in the arcade with the moving games, and the games in general. I thought the one thing that really screamed the 80\u2019s would be an Arcade. Using those little details helped me create an environment that the player could explore and relate to. Another thing would be the transitions I learned in Mclouds book. Like I said earlier the transitions really helped me simulate a transition through time that made the act of time travel seem more understandable to the player.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/97690aabffee43ea22df4ea799c03ca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LizardMan9000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
