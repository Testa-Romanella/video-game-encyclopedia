The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p>\n<p>Week #4: 23.04.2019 - 30.04.2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Repository</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/nomi_proto_4\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game is by me.</p>\n<p>Royalty free music is Slow Motion by www.bensound.com.</p>\n<p>Supervised by\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai\u00a0as part of the Game-A-Week project course in the summer semester of 2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:47:38", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIwNjQ5NjUucG5n/original/5VVWmT.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naomi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
