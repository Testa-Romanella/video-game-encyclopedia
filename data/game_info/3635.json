Much can be bought outside the castle.<br />\nYou meet not only enemies but also other characters with whom interaction is possible. The smith can sell weapons and armour, and the gipsy can sell different magic things. A meeting with an architect can help with the exploration and reconstruction of the castle. The study of the castle promises useful finds. Among other spaces of the game are a forest, a dungeon and a tower.<br />\nAt the disposal of the player, there is a book in which all the messages encountered during the game are collected. Messages inform us about what is there and what is happening.<br />\nThe map is always generated anew and randomly, and the hero always dies at the end of the game, but all of his money is saved, and they can improve the character of the new game.
