(V1).", "description": "<p>Space Invaders clone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alien Invasion.</p>\n<p>Survive against an onslaught of alien waves. This game uses only the mouse for the reason of having precise movement and speed, the use of only two buttons.</p>\n<p>Right button (Mouse) will fire your regular lasers. Holding the button down will have little effect.. you will have to constantly press it.</p>\n<p>Left button (Mouse). Once you have picked up the barrier or rocket item floating around. It will give you a random number to use. Click the left button to place the barrier and replenish lost defences.. with the rockets, simply point at the enemy and the rocket will fire away from the player towards the enemy. If any enemy is front of an enemy you clicked on, and is in the path of the rocket, it will be destroyed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other pick ups include a bomb, when shot, will explode with a massive radius destroying anything in the way. An atomic bomb will also appear, once shot, anything and everything on the screen from enemies to bonuses will be destroyed and bonuses given to the player.</p>\n<p>Once both the defence and rockets have been picked up, both will fire at the same time. You should probably quickly use them, also they will not stack, if you have 5 rockets and pick up another object with 1 rocket given to you.. you will lose those rockets. So use your defences and rockets often.</p>\n<p>You can press ESC at anytime on your keyboard to return to the title menu to switch player.</p>\n<p>UPDATES TO COME:</p>\n<p>Player death animations. Player death counts redone. Alien sprite changes. Even faster alien smooth movements.. not sure when.. but I will be making changes to these. As much as id like to make this a two player co-operative, I dont think I will add that just yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11bb43c46bde1d7acfef46501b9f25c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craig A.
