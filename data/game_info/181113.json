While invisible, you're invicible to bombs.</p>\n<p>-Speed : You're brighter. Max speed and acceleration multiplied by 2.</p>\n<p>-Bouncy : you're a little brighter. You bounce on walls instead of being stopped by them.</p>\n<p>-Tiny : You're tinier. Pretty much it.</p>\n<p>And sorry for the lack of graphics and sound, I've done it by myself in 4 hours....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d66a0b82f5f72de261a3788abd44def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Le Codex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
