It is known that haikus go by a 5-7-5 syllable pattern but there are some poets who argue that these syllables should be shorter because of the difference in japanese characters.</p>\n<p>The only thing I'll say is to try to at least be aware of which words you are choosing and if the progression of words forwards makes sense (but honestly don't worry too much about that since this is a just a prototype - I'm open to anything). Other than that, choose words that you feel are right :) (or go crazy)\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have a questionaire below after you have played this experience! Also if you are someone that I messaged personally, screenshot me your poem :]\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also post your poem in the comments if you want!</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/XX9YdpVbLfuUSoZS6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e13e3515a7ec9fdda7b0c17b6b749fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pumibless"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
