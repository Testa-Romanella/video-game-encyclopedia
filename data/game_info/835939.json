Danger, intrigue and cosmic adventure await you- but first you'll need to pass your basic piloting exam.</p>\n<p>Until they can trust you with their multi-trillion credit spacecraft, you'll need to prove yourself in this T71 Kestral, a rather care-worn training craft whose only weapon shoots ping pong balls. Yes, it's a tad under-powered but the T71 more than makes up for this with rustic charm. You'll love it.</p>\n<p>After the \"incident\" during an earlier attempt, Squadron officials have set up a series of driving test courses in a seemingly harmless derelict space freighter. What could go wrong? Naturally, it would be decidedly non-ideal for you to run into hostile life forms. We ran a scan and are 90% sure-ish that you won't see any. If you do, maybe you can find a way to dispatch them passively. You'll figure it out- or maybe you won't. How exciting!</p>\n<p>Zip around through fifteen exciting levels over 5 separate environoments in your quest for the Star Squadron Pilot's License. Find the hidden tokens in each stage to open up later courses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One request: please do try not to die. It results in a lot of cumbersome admin and could result in damage to the T71. Also, your demise would go down on your permanent record, so yeah, try to avoid dying.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T11:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e486329e09418f5641c1d81dfb687a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["klemjohansen"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
