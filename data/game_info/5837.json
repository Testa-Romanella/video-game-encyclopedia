Your girlfriend has been kidnapped by the moon men, and the only way to get her back is to eat all the fruit out of 45 crazy jar-worlds!<br/><br/>The game has simple controls.  Tip your iPhone to move Hoggy left or right, and touch the screen to reverse his gravity.  <br/><br/>Use your reflexes to grab all the fruit in each level, and use your mind to force your enemies to grab the fruit you can't reach!<br/><br/>It's a great retro-arcade experience!  If you love side scrollers and arcade action, you'll love Hoggy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd1c7b2943965f0a9adfef3f1cfe2d0f.jpeg", "website": "http://www.raptisoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Raptisoft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Raptisoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
