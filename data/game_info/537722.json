I think I used zilf version 0.8 at the time, which faithfully implemented most of the original ZIL and proved not too difficult to use. Since that time, there has been a resurgence of ZIL-coded games (take a look at the ZIL facebook group).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b11c1db01af454856e731550d593275b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dhakajack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
