Fly through the air and don't hit pipes for the high score! :D</p>\n<p>Support for Joy-Cons is added (any key to flap), and I haven't tested XBOX and PS yet but they should work. If you get them to work please tell me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:48:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e99e1940aa119ed1b43fac5331300f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Family Comics Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
