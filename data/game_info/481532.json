You play as Collin who is a firefighter in the state of Oregon but the thing is that his body is almost entirely made of steel so he is immune to the heat of most fires. He is sent out to scenes where fires have gotten out of control and civilians are still inside. He is equipped with an incredibly strong water pistol that allows him to shoot high pressure water that extinguishes the water. There are differing sizes of fires each with their own health pools and point values. Also as you can see there are people laid out across the map and they are civilians that you can collect for extra points.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:20:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53cc529582367dd7b794a704e10c3078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2wo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
