Addicted to overthinking, lo-fi, and making video games, I decided to merge all three hobbies into one project, thus, Introvert: A Teenager Simulator was born. I have developed this game completely by myself except for some audio, songs and the voice acting. Oh, and I am also 19 and a first-year university student. After releasing a lot of failed commercial games, I realized that I don\u2019t care about money and that what I really want is to create my own universe and community :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-01T22:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2ef386b6aa700f51df8aaa155ec0302.jpg", "website": "https://www.euphoricbrothers.com/contact-us", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 45, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Euphoric Brothers"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Euphoric Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
