The purpose of the hackathon was to create a fun educational game that incorporated the Thinksy educational plugin.<br/></p><p>This game in particular is centered around the concept of space and the planets, dwarf planets, and star residing in our solar system.</p><p>Two mini-games exist in this game. </p><p>One mini-game is a procedurally generated maze that the player must roll a planet through. The maze exit is the correct answer to the Thinksy question.</p><p>The other mini-game has the player flying a spaceship to a planet of interest. Along the flight path, the player can fly through rings that contain possible answers to the Thinksy question. Once the user reaches the planet, fun facts are revealed about that planet.</p><p>The main goal of this game is to learn and have fun at the same time.</p><p>I hope you do just that!</p><p>- Thunder Egg Concepts<br/></p><p>To learn more about the Thinksy tool, visit the following pages:</p><p>https://www.thinksylearn.com//</p><p>https://parent.thinksylearn.com/</p><p>http://hackathon.thinksylearn.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ada97b45ec3078e74da2de990b607bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thunder Egg Concepts"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
