His friendly manner attracted the interests of\u00a0thousands of children yearly. But the downfall of this amusement park came quicker than expected. Due to unknown reasons, the park was closed and abandoned just 10 years after it was opened. The owners didn't make any statements, a night shift employee even stated that he wasn't informed of the closing until several weeks after.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhat happened at this park?\r\nEpisode 1 (Gilla's Ride):\r\n\n<p>Some time after the park was closed, you, the player break in and make your way through the park, first encountering Gilla the Giraffe in the park's famous roller coaster \"Gilla's Ride\". The Giraffe was always described to be very friendly and formal, so nobody would think any bad of it. After all, it's a giraffe!</p>\r\nCONTROLS (IMPORTANT!!):\r\n<p><strong>WASD - WALK</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>MOUSE - TURN AROUND</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT - SPRINT</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LMB - USE GRAPPLING GUN</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LEFT CONTROL - CROUCH (!!!)</strong></p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>The game in its entirety (models, music, sound, characters, story, programming, voice acting, sprites) was made by BowserJ in only 1,5 weeks.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/bowserjdev</p>\n<p>Tested by\u00a0</p>\n<p>TheUnique1: https://twitter.com/TheUnique113</p>\n<p>Zomlord: https://twitter.com/Zomlord\u00a0</p>\n<p>fax machine: https://twitter.com/prodeusenjoyer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Textures by AmbientCG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:14:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8303ff3d4bb81b74227a963b24ae0701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JT JG Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
