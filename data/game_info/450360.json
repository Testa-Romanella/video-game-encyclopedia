Each of them starts at a different point of the maze.</p>\n<p>-The players have the mission to locate and collect a key\u00a0<strong>(a blue sphere)</strong>, to later use it in order to open the exit door\u00a0<strong>(a blue door)</strong>.</p>\n<p>-On the stage we can find various periscopes, which will allow us to observe a fixed point above the walls. Thanks to this view and using trees and other periscopes in the distance as reference points, we can easily orient ourselves and locate our targets.</p>\n<p>-The object is guarded by an enemy AI that will react aggressively if the player approaches or the object is usurped.</p>\n<p>-If this enemy touches a player, the game will be reset.</p>\n<p><strong>-To win, both players must exit the maze.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1:</p>\n<p>-Movement: WASD.</p>\n<p>-PLayer 2:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Movement: Arrows.</p>\n<p>Common control: \"H\". This key can be pressed by any of the players and serves to return the key to its original location. This can be useful to avoid the death, if the enemy is near.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T02:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d26ba9b035fba01b638595793ca38e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Embrox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
