The theme is \"only one\" which I applied to the gameplay controls. Just one button. I spent about 18 hours making the game including development and finding/modifying art assets. This is my first game jam submission and I'm pretty proud of it. I'd like the game to be longer, and have a menu for choosing your level, etc. but that wasn't in the cards with such a short development cycle. I may add to it later though.\u00a0I hope you enjoy it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94bc8052f84826d782b6f0ebf6c6d63d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TheMightyZeus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
