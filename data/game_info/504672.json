The theme was Stuck in a Loop. My interpretation was that every time you collect a powerup, you are transported back to the beginning of the game and another path is opened up. I had a blast making this game, and it was my first Ludum Dare. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5fb887c41a7bd4059ab118ad0141fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HamsterDogg55"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
