Enter the wintry house after winning over the front door, and your journey begins. Instead of upgrading your arsenal, you can obtain more cards by winning battles. <br/><br/>More than that\u2014every new encounter raises a question: do you save your opponent by \"cleaning\" them of the darkness that surrounds the house, or do you kill them, leaving both their moves and dialogue unreachable?<h3>Story</h3><br/>Oogy: Can You Help is driven by the dark story that seems to be seeping into every room of the arts-and-craft styled map. The characters and cutscenes are designed to pull in more narrative-inclined players, tying up the loose ends and getting to the bottom of each question raised through the multi-hour, multi-day play time.<h3>Cards</h3><br/>- Collect as many cards as you can as Oogy, the sheep who somehow answers the call for help<br/>- Cards have familiar mechanics such as Attacking and Shield, but each enemy has characteristic types of cards that you can only obtain from that type of enemy<br/>- Start by playing 1 card per turn, with 4 cards visible at once<br/>- Cards and characters provide the ability to manage and synergize with your cards and deck in exciting, wicked ways<h3>Encounters</h3><br/>- Boss fights and minibosses that are definitely more than they appear<br/>- Each boss unlocks the ability to play more cards per turn, incentivizing boss fights that may sometimes be completely optional<br/>- Deep and dark narrative story that is only accessible by saving those you fight and exploring as much of the map as possible<h3>Design</h3><br/>- Original music for each room and major encounter in the game<br/>- Hand-drawn character style and arts-and-crafts map style<br/>- Secret passageways and puzzles<h3>Extras</h3><br/>- Endgame that allows for multiple playthroughs without having to start over from scratch<br/>- Enjoy extra rooms that have compelling gameplay switchups and specific music tracks.<br/>- Infinitely long \u2018The Attic Observatory\u2019<br/>- Rhythm map \u2018The Music Room\u2019<br/>- Gauntlet boss map 'The Bunker'<br/><br/>..and more!<h3>Author</h3><br/>Written, composed, and developed by Julian Weiss.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T04:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67c/67c2ebe2e4c5b152b54a4c15ce5a1d8f.jpg", "website": "https://oogycanyouhelp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Julian Weiss"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Julian Weiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
