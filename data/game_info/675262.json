However, this game is entirely in 2D!<br/></p>\n<p>The game focuses around a few elements:</p>\r\nPocobot\r\n\n<p>Moves around and pushes things into place. Control him to bring the facility back online</p>\r\nReactors\r\n\n<p>Produce energy, but also create heat. Don't allow their thermals to reach zero!</p>\r\nCoolers\r\n\n<p>These keep the thermals of the reactors in check to keep them running smoothly</p>\r\nPower Cores\r\n\n<p>These store energy, charge them up with the reactors to restore power to the facility<br/></p>\r\nTime Button\r\n\n<p>Stand on this button to have time move forward more quickly. Helpful for slow charging Power Cores</p>\r\nDoors\r\n\n<p>These need to be powered to move through the facility</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/6663cc74c8d81f3403d1e960f73f28dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bitDecay Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
