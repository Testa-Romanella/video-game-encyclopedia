In our game, your attacks with fill up the enemy's health bar and when all icons are full, you convinced him that his actions are wrong and he will join your team. When one of your players lose their full health, they are not convinced anymore, so they run to the enemys team.</p>\n<p>Keep convincing people to stay safe and home and not hoard toilet paper!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, there are 3 types in this game with their respective counterparts:</p>\n<p>social - antisocial (hearts)<br/>mindful - harmful (wash hands)<br/>empathic - egoistic (toiletpaper)</p>\n<p>Some types are better against others, but we won't tell which :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play: </strong>Find people who don't follow the important rules in these corona days, approach and fight them! Basic WASD movement, interaction with E. In the fight, just click the buttons with your mouse.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This being our first gamejam together (where we actually kind of finished a game) time management was a huge factor. Sadly, in the end there wasn't enough time for sounds or music. But we did our best and hope you enjoyed our litte game :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Making turn-based games is so much fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credit to Synty Studios for their polygon city pack, Mixamo for the animations and Kenney for the UI! &lt;3</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d064571cb5bd092f832e8f5edd52672e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sarah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
