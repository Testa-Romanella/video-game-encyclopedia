It's because the pirates stash all their treasure in the trees! \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFew people know this, but one crab does, named Clawrence. He's greedy for Gold, Diamonds and Rubies, and he's found a great spot to catch them as they fall - if it weren't for all the pesky coconuts that fall at the same time!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Help Clawrence dodge falling coconuts, weave through airborne mazes and play beach ball keepy-uppy, and if you're really good, collect enough treasure to secure a place on the leaderboard!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGet ready to Crab some Gold!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCoconut Dodge \u00a9 Copyright 2010 FuturLab Limited.
