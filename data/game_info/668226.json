Japan</strong>, in the world of twenty-second century\u2014a world in which mounting environmental crises have forced humanity to put aside their differences in favor of joining together to save their species through the promising frontier of space exploration\u2014Dream of Stars follows the story of one\u00a0<strong>Tomohiro Ishikawa</strong>, a reclusive and bitter young man who elected two years ago to turn away from the outside world in favor of living a secluded life within his tiny apartment and passing his time\u2014and making a small living\u2014writing computer code and hacking into one computer system or another. \u00a0These talents, through a fortuitous turn of events, draw the attention of a certain man:\u00a0<strong>Hiroaki Abe</strong>, the head of the much-lauded yet mysterious government space exploration and research agency colloquially known as\u00a0<strong>Hoshi</strong>. \u00a0Offered a spot on Hoshi's roster as a computer systems engineer, Tomohiro finally finds a compelling reason to leave his self-imposed prison and once more rejoin the outside world that he had scorned all those years ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>Introduced to a sprawling world of technology and science beneath his very feet, the young Tomohiro acclimates himself to Hoshi\u2019s aims of seeking the secrets of the universe and paving the way for humanity\u2019s eventual ascent into the stars and beyond. \u00a0Aiding him and Hiroaki towards this grand goal are\u00a0<strong>five young women</strong>, each with highly unique traits and skills that make them indispensable to Hoshi\u2019s aims:\u00a0<strong>Tsukiko</strong>, Hiroaki's android assistant;\u00a0<strong>Momoka</strong>, a telepathic alien and Hoshi's counselor;\u00a0<strong>Fumiko Mori</strong>, a child genius and Hoshi's Head of R&amp;D\u00a0<strong>Noah Shimizu</strong>, an old friend of Hiroaki and Hoshi's Head of Operations; and <strong>Kin Suzuki</strong>, a former foster child and Hoshi's fiery and hard-headed chief supervisor. \u00a0Together, in a distant and unfamiliar future, they must band together to the limits of their capabilities to ensure that both humanity\u2019s dreams and their own dreams as individuals are not lost.\r\n</p>\n<p>Will humanity, with Hoshi as its guiding star, accomplish their mission and pave the way for a stellar future for Earth\u2019s inhabitants? \u00a0Will Tomohiro, through facing his own issues, be able to help his comrades face theirs? \u00a0And what sort of secrets lie buried within the hearts and minds of our cast, just below the surface?</p>\n<p>Dream of Stars is\u00a0<strong>rated (by me) T+</strong>. \u00a0There will be <strong>adult language,\u00a0</strong><strong>depictions of fantasy violence, and suggestive/sensual themes</strong>, but there is\u00a0<strong>NO explicit content whatsoever!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Say hello to the protagonist of Dream of Stars and the people he will work with during his time at Hoshi!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0(NOTE: Fumiko's route has\u00a0<strong>no romance plotline.</strong>)</p>\n<p>Plus, meet the two additional heroines who will have <strong>routes of their own</strong>
