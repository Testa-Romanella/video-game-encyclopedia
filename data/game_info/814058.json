Since this prototype for the game is long gone, why not forever preserve it on here?</p>\n<p>The .zip folder for this prototype archive includes:</p>\n<p>- a .zip of a playable version of the prototype</p>\n<p>- the raw files of the prototype</p>\n<p>- a copy of the folder i kept all of the game's files in on my old, shitty computer that i used to have</p>\n<p>- some footage of the game that showed the prototype in development, along with some concept art!</p>\n<p>Well that'll be it for now, enjoy the archive and stay fresh goobers! :))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905fa9f2970267d2aa6967e511e34200.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScruffTuna"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
