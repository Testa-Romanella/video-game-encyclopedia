In this hectic local multiplayer party game you play as magnets Maggie, Neo, Gilbert and Pole. Push your friends into the lava and pull all the bolts and powerups to yourself. But watch out! Pulling loose barrels might knock you in the lava.</p>\n<p>The theme of this GGJ was <strong>Duality</strong>. In that theme we have chosen to feature the push and pull mechanic, with characters showing completely different emotions and moods.</p>\n<p>We are very excited with the end result! You may play with Xbox controllers (accelerate with RB, move with left stick and press X to push and B to pull), PlayStation controllers or keyboard (WASD, space to join, enter to ready/push, Q to pull).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:52:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/523/5233995f230aa983c27044243035b132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teamhaardvuur", "redband1t", "iantje"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
