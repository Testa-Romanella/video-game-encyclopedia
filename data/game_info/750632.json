As you explore the cozy island, you discover some magical items, a rock glove, a flute of wind, speedy potion? well, these items have a dual purpose, both restorative and destructive. What could they mean?\u00a0</p><p>Anyway, I only got the Rock glove in, and the game is mostly chill about exploration. You collect coins, and have to look for the rock glove in a crate somewhere, then I will leave the rest to you... Walk with Wads, move camera with Mouse, Press E to interact with stuff.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE - this is a demo proof of concept that I\u00a0plan to work on in the future. Its a prototype made for GGJ2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80d5da31ff0bbc0723014873f5fa86c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kae"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
