The game is challenging, so anyone who is fairly new to Pok\u00e9mon I don't recommend playing this game as a start to your Pok\u00e9mon series.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: The game lore isn\u2019t direct and the sources you read or talk to are just perspectives, however if you piece together everything then you will discover the truth of this island. The game has a true ending and a secret ending. If anyone need help getting the secret ending here's a hint: find a pinkish text in a temple and make careful dialogue choices with the \"person\".\u00a0This is my first ever game so it's not perfect, but I can ensure that it is very playable! Oh and\u00a0the evolutions that are required by trading and using stones has been changed to levels instead (Including the starters) :P</p>\n<p>One last thing, this game is made using RPG Maker and there's a ton of features made by talented people that enhanced this experience a ton! Their names\u00a0will all be shown in the credits\u00a0at the end of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4bd880caa642e3af48ebb4c09ae8b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoulWolfx"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
