At the end of China's Warring States period, the Kingdom of Qin, led by its king Ying Zheng, better known in the future as Qin Shi Huang (the first emperor of the unified Chinese empire), is on the verge of conquering all kingdoms of the then fragmented China.</p>\n<p>The kingdom of Han, foreseeing the fate of being conquered, sent assassin Jing Ke in attempt to end the reign of Ying Zheng, and the rest of the failed assassination, can be read on the Wikipedia page. <br/></p>\r\nHP &amp; Mobility\r\n<p>A low mobility prevents you from being able to (d)ash, a high mobility auto dodges attacks.</p>\n<p>A slash into nothing will cost you mobility, a slash into something will gain you mobility.<br/></p>\n<p>Note that as in real life, two sword wounds will likely kill you.</p>\n<p>Be careful.</p>\r\nCombat\r\n<p>I aimed to be more tactical, so your dagger poke (by pressing \"a\") will not automatically hit your target. You need to predict where your target is going, and poke the dagger at the right time.<br/></p>\r\nThe Difficulty\r\n<p>Some might feel this is too easy (or too hard, I really have not looked at the balance). I intended to make this a bit \"historical\" in the sense that all the mistakes Jing Ke made was reproducible. In your actual run, however, you will hardly throw your dagger away (leaving you defenseless). Yet if you want to die like the real Jing Ke, you can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da8/da88bfe7a050fe74d272cc021b55fda3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ceremonial"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
