The local doctor advises our protagonist that his father may be saved if he can manage to collect three medicinal ingredients located across the desert. The protagonist then must set out to find the ingredients while interacting with NPC's to learn of the location of the many ingredients. However, certain NPC's will try to persuade the boy that their are 'better' ingredients which he can use to cure his father. If the boy chooses to use the better ingredients he can use them in one of the possible 9 combinations available to create the medicine. If the combination is incorrect the boy will witness his father turn into a cactus. If the combination is correct then the father will be cured. </p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Movement:<ul><li>Left Thumb Stick, Arrow Keys or WASD</li></ul></li><li>Pick Up:<ul><li>E key or A button</li></ul></li><li>Pause<ul><li>Escape Key or Start button</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>\n<p>We are a passionate group of University students that have come together to produce a game that we are as a group proud of.
