Originally, I wanted to combine the story of the Chinese Zodiac with a small racing mini-game that would be inspired by the Run Rattatta Run game of\u00a0Pokemon Stadium for Nintendo64 by Nintendo.\u00a0 You would get to pick your own Zodiac animal as your avatar, and would mash a button on your keyboard to get you to run, and another button to jump over hurdles. I\u00a0started to really get into the idea of being able to have multiple people play by choosing number of players and having different buttons for each, and the image of 4 people on one keyboard mashing away to try and beat each other and perhaps even sabotage/trick each other seemed quite fun.\u00a0<br/><br/>I\u00a0realized very quickly that Bitsy is not built for that level of game play, and decided to save that ambition for another game/engine down the line.\u00a0<br/><br/>After learning more about Bitsy and playing some games made with it, I realized\u00a0 that is built with narrative gaming in mind. I decided to make a story about The Chinese Zodiac since I\u00a0already was inspired to use it before. It was the Year of the Rat after all, which is probably where the theme came from, and I noticed that no one else had made a Bitsy game/story of The Great Race.\u00a0 Thus, I ended up making a small narrative game using Bitsy to tell the story of The Great Race of The Chinese Zodiac. I added a small collection \"mini-game\" where you can collect Oranges for Good Luck. There are 20 of them for the year 2020.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a simple narrative fiction that I enjoyed making. I look forward to the next Bitsy Jam as I get more familiar with Bitsy and get more creative with it.</p>\n<p>Have fun, enjoy, and Happy New Year!</p>\n<p>#bitsyjam #rat #2020 #lunarnewyear #yearoftherat #oranges #jadeemperor #emperor #bitsy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T02:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff554569e4ad691a96438feee946921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maria Deslis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
