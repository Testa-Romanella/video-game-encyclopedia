It is hardcoded jn JavaScript with the help of the p5.js library.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are simple, it's the mouse / touchscreen: you just have to click on the quartz to grapple your way around the underground ( inspired by gold digger ) while avoiding black bombs. Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to p5.js for their awesome library\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0060d0ce9df125e1cdf3f983d690bc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["willitennis@gmail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
