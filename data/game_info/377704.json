I'm curious about what you think to improve it :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>- Select a plane in the Arrival Queue at left, and select a runway to place it, before it run out of gas!</p><p>- Be careful! You won't be able to replace a plane on a runway before the previous one on it reach the depot.</p><p>- Red plane are slower, and green plane are faster, but have more limited fuel!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90d2c47fd791dfa902cf92870c799fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tipyx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
