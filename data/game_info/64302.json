If you use your wits you may even get to play various forms of mini-games, including Whack-A-Mole, a Slotmachine, simulating an alien invasion, and more; all done by tossing coins. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBreak Stuff with Coins is first and foremost a wacky physics destruction game, but also contains elements of exploration and puzzles.<br/>\r\nWith 20 unique coins to unlock, each with their own stats, bonuses, and effects, you will have at least 20 good reasons to play (and replay) the 7 levels with a high replay value. On top of that, there's a good handful of mini-games and toys to unlock.<br/>\r\nTo top it all off, you will be accompanied by your witty butler, Nigel Wadsworth III, who will be your loyal companion throughout the game, giving you words of encouragement along the way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-22T13:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1964bf55eeb963271c162f492fdfb5bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 133, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MKJ Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MKJ Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
