{"id": 840150, "slug": "paranoimal", "name": "Paranoimal", "name_original": "Paranoimal", "description": "<p>Paranoimal is a small top down collection game made for Snappy Guru's August game jam with the theme being \"Ignorance is bliss\".</p>\n<p>\u00a0In Paranoimal the player takes on the role of a thief who has broken into a haunted mansion and must find and secure what loot they can whilst avoiding the ghosts. The twist is the ghosts don't like being looked at and will attack if the player does so. To survive the player should ignore the ghosts as much as possible either by looking away or blocking them out with music on their mp3 player, but use it sparingly as it battery wont last forever .</p>\n<p>Paranoimal was made in 4 days by me alone in Unreal Engine 5. I\u00a0created all assets with the exception of particle effects and sound effects which were sourced from the Unreal marketplace and freesound.org respectively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Audio attribution:</p>\n<p>Code_Box,\u00a0Evanjones4,\u00a0Lennyboy,\u00a0filmsndfx,\u00a0blainksaint,\u00a0SoundDesignStuff,\u00a0deleted_user_96253,\u00a0rap2h,\u00a0worldmaxter,\u00a0toinsill5,\u00a0eponn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:31:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f7e01c97afdc342819565904e83023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeFarrant3D"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
