Haunted by images of a memory she can't recall.  Follow Nicole and Gabby's lives as they try and put the pieces together that are tearing at them daily.  Something or someone is lurking out in the darkness.  Waiting.  Help them discover the truth before it is too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is built on perspectives and choices.  To understand the whole story you would need to play through the game at least twice.  Simultaneous events occur that give insight to the main story.  Cinematic music was a must have to drive the fear and tense scenes.  The story itself has been in the works for years.  It was finding the right medium to tell it that was difficult.  This visual novel gave us the perfect platform for all sides to be seen from the characters perspective.  We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed building it.  It was a labor of love.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T03:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e488b2e4ce0963a8f3b7a825509c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Two Trees"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Two Trees"], "esrb_rating": null}
