You are given your own planet, with a random number at the start. You can just about see some other people's planets and you notice that they are all alone. You on the other hand have a friend, who has apparently been on the planet longer than you have. I stand to learn much from him, even if he is slightly mentally unstable from what you believe are a lot of years on this floating space rock.<br/></p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>:<br/>Just spend some time with the NPC on your planet. You'll hear some interesting things about him, concerning the people on other planets, his personal interests and even some quips from popular culture. There isn't a lot of game to be had, per se, but there are some neat secrets and random events, if you are lucky enough.<br/><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>- A or Left - Move left<br/>- D or Right - Move right<br/>- LMB - Spin axe?<br/>- Space - Debug Menu<br/>- Space+R - Reset Game<br/>- Space+P - Pixel Perfect Graphics (may help with performance)<br/>- Escape - Quit</p><strong>Links</strong>:<p><strong>I would love if you would leave a rating and/or feedback on the game's Ludum Dare page: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/alone-toget...</strong><br/></p><p>- Twitter: https://twitter.com/theartylo<br/>- Source: https://github.com/Artylo/ld38<br/></p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 38.
