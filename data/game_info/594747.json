And once you're ready to move on, just walk through the tunnel opposite the artwork and when you re-enter the gallery you'll get 5 more pieces!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>L = Toggle Display Lights (on/off)</p>\n<p>O = Toggle Display Lights' Intensity (high/low)</p>\n<p>K = Toggle Room Lights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Customising searches</strong>: The default search terms are \"#furryart\" and \"#furryartist\". Once the game has been ran once, you can change these, adding and removing whatever terms you want by:</p>\n<p>1. Press the Windows Key and the \"R\" Key at the same time.</p>\n<p>2. Type \"%AppData%\" and hit enter.</p>\n<p>3. Navigate to the folder called \"Simmo\", then \"ArtGallery\" and open \"searchTags.txt\"</p>\n<p>4. Edit away! Place each tag on a new line though!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note about NSFW content</strong>: By default, the Gallery won't show anything that Twitter classes as \"Possibly Sensitive\"., as well as tweets including common NFSW terms (e.g. \"Sex\" and \"P**n\" and so on...) This (should) include most NSFW content. If you wish for \"Possibly Sensitive\" content to be included, add the following tags to the search terms:</p>\n<p>1. Add \".allownsfw\" to allow NSFW content</p>\n<p>2. Add \".allowswears\" to allow bad language</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/577482f32aa5a00bba681ba130479bf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simmo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
