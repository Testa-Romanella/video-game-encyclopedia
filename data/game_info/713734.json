Feel the full power of a kind of annoying Spider-Bo with weirdo combat, a ragdoll, jumps, and a small fighting area. A rookie still, this is the most weird yet normally weird Spider-Bo you\u2019ve ever played.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Experience a game\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The worlds of Boyko Cosmo and Spider-Bo don't collide in an weird, action-packed game. In this new Spider-Bo universe, iconic characters from Spider-Man\u2019s life have been stolen because I couldn't come up with a different villain from Venom\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Broswald\u2019s New York is not your playground\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The Big Apple comes to life as Broswald's most expansive and interactive world yet because this is the first game. Swing through the one small area and catch Venom and yourself. Use the your one weapon to defeat villains with epic takedowns in truly strange action. As you can see from those the game is not much though I might expand more on the game in the future so stay tuned\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>**Note this is just a prototype and MAY be continued in the future**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b42c89b4a5b37a58b90d81038e4f41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Broswald"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
