After a grueling week of development we have created a demo/prototype of the newest gaming Icon...Tomb Gator! He's an alligator. In a Tomb. That's it, that's the whole goddamn thing. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a web browser version, but we've also included a rom with edited control instructions.</p>\n<p>Use the Arrow keys to move up and down the pyramid (The one in Las Vegas) and collect coins whilst avoiding tomb walls and pesky martian pharaohs. Get used to it because that's pretty much all you do in the whole game. Get through the 3 demo levels and you win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things we intend to improve:</p>\n<p>More levels</p>\n<p>High Score saving</p>\n<p>Better music</p>\n<p>Color</p>\n<p>Super Gameboy Border</p>\n<p>More artwork</p>\n<p>Cutscenes</p>\n\n<p>Please suggest away and give our fat reptilian asses feedback. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/5409e38ab3e8b11f093b8731fc6cbfdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["generalgruntin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
