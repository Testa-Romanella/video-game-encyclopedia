However, it's still very early in development with play times averaging 30-45 minutes. Some parts are still unfinished, but I feel that it's at a good enough point to show the public that it can become something.</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by\u00a0surreal horror\u00a0games such as Yume Nikki and its fan-games like .flow and Yume 2kki. I highly recommend that any fan of those gives this a try!</p>\n<p>There is no definitive end to this version,\u00a0the goal is mainly to see if you can find all the content.
