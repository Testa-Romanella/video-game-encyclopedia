You discover the remnants of an alien base on a battle field that took place between two alien races.\u00a0 The freezing temperatures of Europa has left the battlefield almost perfectly preserved in ice and everything you find is a new discovery for mankind.\u00a0 Your mission has taken on a whole new life.\u00a0 Now there is technology to be found, bases and crashed ships to explore, and aliens to understand.\u00a0 But why were these races fighting?\u00a0 How was so much damage done?\u00a0 And are the aliens that did this still here?...\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Should state the goals for this game for the term (i.e., what criteria must be met for the term project to be complete)<br/>Our goals for this game are to develop an adventure game that randomly generates new areas for a player to explore every time they play the game.\u00a0 We intend to develop enemies that behave intelligently based on their strength and the strength of the players, so the enemies are not suicidal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>##### Advanced AI<br/>- Ness Colihan (Group Lead)<br/>- Graeme Rock<br/>- Christian Brill</p>\n<p>##### Physics Engine<br/>- Tyler Thompson (Group Lead)\u00a0<br/>- Kyle Hartenstein<br/>- Brad Munson</p>\n<p>##### Procedural Generation\u00a0<br/>- Brendan Valley (Group Lead)<br/>- George Meisinger<br/>- Jacob Bader<br/>- Justin Budd</p><p>##Note: The file readme.txt in Bandcamp.zip is an extended version of this description that includes information such as our development strategy, coding standards set at the start of development, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/740/7406e7b21039f0c59b3d27c60d2ed0a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TylerThompson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
