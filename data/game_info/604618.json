Some are hiding in trees, some are\u00a0taking a swim and some might even be a bit scary. It's more of a little time waster than a game, but I hope you'll still enjoy it. This game was made in GB-Studio for the 80th Mini Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/755e330a80f4ff80c0628adf1aa23397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["LL_Productions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
