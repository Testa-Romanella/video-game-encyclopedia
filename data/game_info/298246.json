I like to call it a mix between quick strategy game and logic game. You command an army of little ships and try to dominate asteroid field. It is level-based game with ever increasing difficulty. Levels are unforgiving but short, so forget about fail after 30 minutes spent by building your army. Either you win in a few minutes, or you lose.</p>\n<p>Game is already finished with 100\u00a0levels (about 5\u00a0- 10\u00a0hours of playtime depending on your skills)</p>\n<p>Game features fully working level editor where you can build your own custom levels</p>\n<p>You can even get your own level featured in the game if you send it to me\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:52:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23656bb161625f48314bd20332d15fa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samulew2@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
