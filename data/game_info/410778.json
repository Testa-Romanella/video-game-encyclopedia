You can aim once in the circle by using AWSD/Arrow keys. As you go through games it gets harder and harder.\u00a0</p><p>EXTRA:</p>\n<p>Currently only the\u00a0endless mode is available, but I'm planning two other game modes and a few more\u00a0game mechanics.<br/></p><p>This is a project I started not too long ago and wanted to have it playable. I plan on updating this game to have more features and fix bugs. Suggestions and constructive criticisms\u00a0are more than welcome. This game will always be FREE, but I appreciate small donations as it allow me to not take on as much work and focus on creating games. Thank you for your time and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b86610dc665f3f7ea18e0ef98e300fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yxmx_rsx"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
