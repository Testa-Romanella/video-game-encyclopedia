The levels are quite rushed but I hope you like the game :). This is my first jam ever and it's been a blast. Thanks to everyone participating and making it possible!</p>\n<p>In case the WebGL build doesn't load, you can download a Windows executable below :).<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f0501acf5f60b900fb2b6f51da42274c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["PolloMagico"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
