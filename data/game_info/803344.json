I'm releasing this game as a way to make up for the lack of Peepy Commits a Crime, I promise that game is still underway. Anyways, Super Cocoto Kart is what would happen if Super Mario Kart, and Cocoto Kart Racer had a crossover. I had to remove some characters from Mario to make sure that the races weren't super crowded, so I'm sorry about that. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T15:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cad1560cbd571fcd32669a2a3591bb31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Dark Bean"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
