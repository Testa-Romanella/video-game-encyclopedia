Putting full focus into the completion of ver 2.0, we are taking the project down from steam, until we are prepared for launch in Q4 2016 (winterish). We will be sharing progress of the new engine and TUG ver 2.0, as we get closer to release, so please feel free to follow @nerdkingdom for updates.<br/><br/>The new engine brings significant advances over the current 1.0 version, including: <br/>- access to more generations of hardware, <br/>- enhanced graphics<br/>- super fancy new art <br/>- flexible modding/dev environment <br/>- pretty rad mod distribution system<br/>- data/analytics systems for modders<br/>- logic systems<br/>- new terrain generation<br/>- simplified user experience <br/>- 71% less wtf.<br/><br/>Early versions of 2.0 will go to existing TUG users, who will later be able to invite their friends who do not currently have access.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f3b02db2d91fcab1af7392438811ef.jpg", "website": "http://www.nerdkingdom.com/game/index.shtml", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 89, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nerd Kingdom"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nerd Kingdom"], "esrb_rating": null}
