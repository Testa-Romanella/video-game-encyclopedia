Both \n      kids utilize the same control scheme and have the same characteristics. \n      If you\u2019re playing the two-player game, each player must pick a kid. You \n      can\u2019t have two Zekes or two Julies! Each player starts with three lives. \n      When your life bar runs out, you lose a life. There are hidden 1-Up \n      bonuses in the game. You may also earn bonus lives if you have ten \n      victims left when you finish a level. Now, get ready to conquer 48 \n      levels of giant ants, mad scientists, and big babies. Find seven bonus \n      levels (look for the question marks!), earn points, and stockpile your \n      water pistols and other weapons!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
