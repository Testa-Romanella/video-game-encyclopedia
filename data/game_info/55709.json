{"id": 55709, "slug": "seymour-series", "name": "Seymour series", "name_original": "Seymour series", "description": "<p>The Seymour series of games consisted of five computer games released by Codemasters in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They starred the eponymous Seymour, a slug- or potato-like character with large feet. In Your Sinclair magazine, it was repeatedly stated that Seymour was in fact 'a blob of lard', though doubt has been cast as to the veracity of these claims.</p>\n<p>Seymour had his origins in Codemasters' decision to move the established Dizzy series out of their fantasy-style settings and into the real world. They later changed their minds about this, but liked the game that had been designed for the move. Consequently, Seymour was created to star in it.</p>\n<p>In all, five Seymour games were released, of which two were Dizzy-style arcade adventures, and three, also echoing Dizzy, were arcade style. A notable short adventure was also released as a free gift with computer magazines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
