The game is reminiscent of the Foddian genre, with a <strong>large map</strong>, <strong>no checkpoints</strong>, and <strong>large punishments</strong> ready to spring from small mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>The game is designed to<strong> test</strong> your ability of <strong>timing</strong> and <strong>forward planning</strong> to help your little shadow navigate through a continuous landscape to a <strong>near impossible escape</strong> into the light.\u00a0</p><p>Interact with the world by<strong> latching</strong> onto the many grapple points spread across the map, and <strong>strategically </strong>moving around,\u00a0<strong>twisting\u00a0</strong>and <strong>spinning\u00a0</strong>through the dangers that lurk around\u00a0<strong>every corner</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hold W to <strong>charge </strong>a jump, before releasing to <strong>leap </strong>directly upwards with a higher force, and <strong>rise </strong>your way to <strong>victory</strong>!</p>\n<p>Tap S to <strong>freeze mid-air</strong>. This can help with <strong>tight manoeuvres</strong> and is <strong>absolutely essential </strong>for the completion of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Tap Q to <strong>pause time</strong> short a short while. This is incredibly useful for <strong>harder obstacles</strong>, as it allows you to further think through a <strong>risky swing</strong> at the last minute.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some may refer to this type of game as a <strong>rage game</strong>, other may think it is extremely easy.\r\n</p>\n<p>It all depends on the type of player.\r\n</p>\n<p>What Kind of Player Are <strong>YOU</strong>?</p>\n\n\n<p>!!!<strong>NOTICE</strong>!!!</p>\n<p>This game is in early development and is by far a test build that will be improved upon later. Due to this, the maps have not been fully realised, and hence for the players sake, an \"Unstuck\" button has been added. If you are stuck in one spot, just hit the +/= key a few times, and it should remove you from the situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:02:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c800328e7c7aed603e9cba48eb4ceea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dr. D"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
