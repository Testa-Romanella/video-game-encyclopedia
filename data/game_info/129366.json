This game is a two player co-op. Gamepads are highly recommended.</p>\n<p>Start Over is a game I worked on with students in the Cal State Summer Arts program in July of 2017. When one group needed a coder at the last minute I jumped in and wrote the whole thing from scratch in 2 days. So think of it like a game jam game. I may be making periodic updates and fixes but my goal is to pass it off to the students who want to continue working on it.</p>\n<p>Christian Corralejo: 2D characters, sounds, level design, world building and lore.<br/>\r\nNathaniel Reyes: 3D backgrounds, level design, and QA testing.<br/>\r\nJohn Bruneau: Programming, mechanics and development.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to some of the concept contributors along the way.<br/>\r\nDominique Auyeung, Erika Rumbaoa, and Andrew Ajemian</p>\n<p>Gamepad\u00a0Controls<br/>Button 0 or 18 to jump, 2 or 16 to fire.<br/>Keyboard Controls<br/>Player 1: WASD, 'C' to fire, 'V' \u00a0to jump<br/>Player 2: Arrows, '&lt;' to fire, '&gt;' to jump</p>\n<p>Music from freemusicarchie.org<br/>\r\nThe Last Arp Fades At Dawn by Flashbob<br/>\r\nSocial Sentiments 8-bit mix by Kalipluche</p>\n<p>Textures from texturelib.com, designbeep.com, texturex.com</p>\n<p>Future additions:<br/>\u00a0Vendors?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a68294c7e55e6625716439644b11c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Artfail"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
