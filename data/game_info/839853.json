Move your planes over a target to capture it and the nearby area. Flags only capture a small area, whereas houses capture the largest. From a tent, you can build new planes using the money gained per turn. There are three classes of plane from large to small. Smaller planes have less health and attack than larger ones, however they can move further. You can attack another plane by moving yours next to it, and then selecting that other plane.</p>\n<p>A number of features had to be cut in order to make the deadline, such as enemy AI, music, and\u00a0the ability for smaller planes to place down flags.
