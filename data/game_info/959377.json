After some unusually strong attacks by the EN Curse, the Council seeks to investigate for a\u00a0source. What\u00a0they find waiting for them\u00a0sends the entire Council, and their world,\u00a0into disarray.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hololive CouncilRyS RPG is a fangame and love letter to Hololive CouncilRyS, built in RPG Maker MZ\u00a0with custom art assets by me and original\u00a0musical arrangements of Hololive songs by Jeremy Robson. Expect the game to be about 3 hours long.</p>\n\r\nMeet the Council!\r\n\r\nFauna\r\n<p>As the\u00a0Keeper of Nature, Fauna can utilize its power to defeat enemies, but she can also tap into nature's healing capability\u00a0to reconstitute her team. She is quick and otherwise well rounded.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nBae\r\n<p>As the embodiment of Chaos, Bae uses powerful explosions to send enemies packing! Boasting a wide variety of skills, her next move is always unpredictable. She is resilient but if you aren't careful, she can run\u00a0out of MP quick!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nKronii\r\n<p>As the Warden of Time, Kronii wields immense power. She can obliterate enemies with her swords and lightning, or she can manipulate time to gain the upper hand. She possesses both a powerful offense and defense.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nIRyS\r\n<p>As a nephilim and an agent of Hope, IRyS inspires her team--healing and buffing them or debuffing enemies through song. Her magic capabilities are unmatched, but her defense is low.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMumei\r\n<p>As the Guardian of Civilization, Mumei wields powerful skills which can rain destruction on her enemies with fire and weapons. Her attack stat is unmatched, but she also lacks defense.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Z: Confirm</li><li>X : Cancel</li><li>Shift (Hold): Run</li><li>Movement: Arrow Keys</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Development, art, writing: Kebbie (@IMKebbie)</li><li>Music: Jeremy Robson (@composerdev)</li></ul>\n<p>Plugins: Visustella, Hakuen Studio, Moghunter, Casper Gaming, kchavezdev, Chroma9, Mokusei Penguin, Aesica, SnakeKillerX.</p>\n<p>All sound effects were either created for the game or available for non-commercial or\u00a0commercial use.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0@DenouemenK @SaraValesteinPL @Axel46761300 @Gigi80945558, and Roger Yu\u00a0for helping with playtesting, and @JankenPomme\u00a0for helping arrange QA!</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n<p>This is an unofficial fangame\u00a0made in adherence to Cover\u2019s fan work guidelines.
