To create basic raycaster (raycasting engine) it took something about 2 weeks after work hours. I'm happy with the results.</p>\n<p>The game has been developed on Macos platform but works \"ok\" on Windows. There may be some hitchs especially when close to walls due to caching issues but from what I saw the problem is with Windows only - maybe my choosing of compiler wasn't good.</p>\n<p>Game is still in development so every feedback will be important to me.</p>\n<p>You can find me @HinodeCoder on Twitter or just send me an email: contact@hinodecode.com</p>\n<p>Game is written in C using pure raycasting techniques from Wolfenstein 3D. SDL has been used to proper render a color buffer to screen and handle input and sound.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>- MY FAMILY - which were supporting me in every minute during game jam and gave me time and space to finish it, THANK YOU</p>\n<p>- PAWEL KOWALEWSKI (@PS_Kowalewski on Twitter) for super cool cover artwork and for a huge amount of ideas for the game, THANK YOU</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d20ebcc13e59a6a5eb3f84c4a18da847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HinodeCoder"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
