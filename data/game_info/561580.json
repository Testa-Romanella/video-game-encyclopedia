You control only one at a time, the other one follows. Only the controled Character can take damage, by touching the Slimes.</p>\n<p>Luna's fireballs (range combat) only attacks the dark blue Slimes.</p>\n<p>Eric can attack everything, his passive ability (when he isn't thr controled one) protects you from enemy projectiles... There are no projectiles in this version... so it is practicly useless.. (But switch sometomes, because they don't share a health pool)</p>\n<p>Bonus tip: Play slow, you shouldn't attack all enemies at once.</p>\n\n<p>Have Fun!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77b446308a3bc404f78198652f837824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["projectfiles"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
