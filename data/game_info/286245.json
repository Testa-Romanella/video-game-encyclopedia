Suddenly the bubbles decided not to follow the rules anymore and escaped away.<br/></p>\n<p>Your mission will be follow the bubbles and finish them all, or at least try it at your best. You can select Nayra or her cousin Ivan to complete the 5 zones of the game, playing in 30 crazy levels and beating a super zone final mega boss.</p>\n\n<p>Being a fan of these old games than made my life great during my young ages I always wanted to develop a PANG clone.</p>\n<p>Well, this is not just a PANG clone, it is much more, you will find serious handicaps on your way as dimensional vortex or wind ripples and moving platforms that will make your way harder.</p>\n<p>Don\u00b4t forget that Characters can jump so use it in your own advantage.</p>\n<p>I believe $3.00 is a fair price for the time I have been finishing this project, you have a demo available to test the game before buying it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/66681b5af82337369f5b2f016e6b156d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HellPine"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
