Hit space to jump.</p><p>This ball bouncing game only partially employs unity's built-in physics system. The ball's y-velocity is moderated by the physics engine, but the deflections are separately calculated. This gives the player more predictable control of the exit angle of the ball off the dog's head. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b293ed1287be296793dd68190bb74003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["drjenkin"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
