It's all about those tasty animation cancels!<br/><br/>In this game you are expected to figure everything out by yourself, but <strong>if you're stuck, here's a spoiler:</strong><br/>While moving, tap a direction to shoot.<br/>You can shoot while bouncing off an altar.<br/>The shoot has a sweetspot 2 tiles away (where the smoke appears) and it deals 2 damage.<br/>You can dash through spikes using the attack's knockback.<br/>You can press space to read the item's description.<br/>Also, 0 key turns on slow motion, 9 turns it off back again.</p><p>There were supposed to be some post-boss levels, but there was too little time to make them.<br/><br/><strong>Have Fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/7172c8c38ec661fad94b4e85638969b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunatic Dancer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
