A hideous monstrosity that makes everyone run scared just at the sight of you. Unfortunately those that you scare are also your primary diet, and without their energy you will not survive! The only way to stay alive is to disguise yourself as a human and devour the humans before they can escape. However causing too much of a disruption will cause the police to become alerted, and they REALLY hate you. The police will shoot you when startled, which will cause you to die. They can however, still be eaten!</p><p>Can you survive long enough to eat all the humans in the city?</p><p>Visit us on the Ludum Dare website!</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&amp;uid=40202<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ab/2ab0769d66d9635a1f0bf5eda3d82ea2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Paperbox Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
