While I vastly ran out of time to execute on most of that, this clocktown at least implements the idea of controlling the time of day based on going clockwise (making it later in time) or counter clockwise (making it earlier in time).</p>\n<p>Since this jam was all about the level and not the gameplay, I spent too much time (proportionally) thinking about the level design. I had an intricate story about saving a defamed prince from a prison to overthrow a sour king on his coronation day, and getting different endings at the end of the \"day\" loop based on what you had or had not done. The sections of the game (harbor, market, and plaza) were also originally planned to very in size and shape and composition, but in a subtle way that hopefully made you think \"wait, was this like this before? It seemed smaller last I was here...\". In the end however, work bogged me down and I did not get really any time for little more than a sliver of what was intended for each region of the town. That, and I didn't quite get the logic perfect for seamlessly blending sections of the world together on runtime, hence some sectors and transition pieces pop in and out when they shouldn't. Consider that just a behind the scenes view.</p>\n<p>I do hope to round out the experience and finish up the game, but alas enjoy this concept in the meantime.</p>\r\nDevlogs\r\n<p><em>Post-jam release devlog coming soon.</em></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All models were made by Patrick (TheDuckCow), no textures or third party assets of any kind were used.
