Again, really weak, but it was something I knew I could do. The game-play is VERY similar to pacman, which I wanted to dice-up and change around, but I ended up not having enough time for that ;w;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf19b71ecc5fa0de142148d0041f082a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SplendidDog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
