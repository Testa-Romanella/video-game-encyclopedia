This version of Sheep Spotting has never been \r\nbetter.<br/><br/><br/>**SHEEP SPOTTING DELUXE**<br/>Sheep Spotting Deluxe is\r\n a funny, fast &amp; highly addictive counting game. These sheep won't \r\nhelp you sleep, but they will keep you up all night playing.<br/><br/>How \r\nmany sheep did you see? Count all the sheep before the time runs out. \r\nEach round gets harder and faster which means more points. It's great \r\nfun, fast and highly addictive.<br/><br/><br/>**NEW LEVELS**<br/>There are \r\nfour different levels to unlock as you play through the game. Watch the \r\nsheep travel as they go swimming, into space and come back sky diving to\r\n Earth. Each level gets harder to spot and requires more sheep to \r\nunlock.<br/><br/><br/>**POWER UPS**<br/>We've added new power ups to the \r\ngame, helping you stay on track. Miss that one sheep and guess \r\nincorrectly; you can now use a life. Got totally confused; then replay \r\nthe level or skip to the next round.<br/><br/><br/>**GAME CENTER**<br/>Sheep\r\n Spotting Deluxe is Game Center enabled so you can compare your scores \r\nwith players all around the world as well as challenge your friends.<br/><br/><br/>**RATE, REVIEW, FEEDBACK AND SHARE**<br/>We want to hear from you!
