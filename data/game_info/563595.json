{"id": 563595, "slug": "slime-tamer", "name": "Slime Tamer", "name_original": "Slime Tamer", "description": "<p>In the Fantasia world, animal tamers rule the society. From ferocious dragons to cute piglets, villagers had made contract with creatures that will live alongside them for the rest of their lives. Slimes, on the other hand, were not considered to be tamable because of their weak genes. Most would die before the contract is formed. Hunters from all over Fantasia would capture these creatures for scientists to experiment on. This is a 2D single player platformer game in which the player is the only slime tamer in this world whose dream is to form a contract with all the slimes in the world, but first, he/she must save them from becoming lab rats by infiltrating into the scientists\u2019 laboratory while the people are away for lunch break. This is a dangerous yet exciting journey!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T05:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df0ee231dff580fbc4e72117b228fd93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JiaxinHuang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
