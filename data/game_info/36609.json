This is the exact same game released then, just recompiled for PC. <br/><br/>As the game was originally built for mobile devices, there may be some terminology such as \"tap\" or \"pinch to zoom\" that can be be replaced by left clicking with your mouse, or scrolling with your mouse wheel.  <br/><br/>As this game has not been updated since 2013 and was intended to be a mobile game, there is a possibility that not all features will work as intended. Just something to keep in mind.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T10:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31e7e482fcac3c46c309d4f9245939b0.jpg", "website": "http://www.synthetix-interactive.com/wobbles.php", "rating": 4.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Synthetix Interactive", "Play Nimbus"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MassDiGI", "Synthetix Interactive", "Play Nimbus"], "esrb_rating": null}
