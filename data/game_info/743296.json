It's a place people dream of going to see, but unfortunately for our protagonist, she has found herself locked in the dungeon. The good news is, escaping things is a daily activity for the well-renowned magician. But that's only the beginning of this journey, now she has to find a way out of the dungeon. She'll need to make friends with anyone she can along the way!</p>\n<p>This RPG uses a first-person perspective, similar to the classic computer role-playing games of old. You'll fight your way through encounters and make friends out of enemies as you climb the eleven floors of this dungeon. Each new ally possesses new talents, and the good news is, your allies are always the same level as you - no need to level up each new friend you make. However, they unlock more talents and powers as they participate in battles, so be sure to try them out as you get them. You'll need a strong team to conquer the fortress. Good luck, and have fun!<br/>#rpg\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the left mouse button to select things, and use the right mouse button to cancel selections.</p>\n<p>Ephraim225 here!\u00a0This is the second game I've ever published, all the way back in June of 2018. I'm not super proud of this one, it's a bit of a relic. I wanted to give it some updates but that ended up not happening. Still, it's here for archival purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T11:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc6c2dabd3fee6c04a3297dc85c5c3f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ephraim225"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
