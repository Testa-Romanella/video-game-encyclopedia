But I'm still proud of it! I had forgotten about Ludum Dare until the first day's morning and I didn't want to miss it this time, so I gave everything I had into this little game, hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/></p><p>NOTE: If you'd like a version where you can restart the game, for speedrunning for example, check this link:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pc3IRmDm8-dDLwGMkZomCajA9Arw3UPy?usp=sha...</p><p>It has the source code as well as a modified version where you can go back to the first screen by pressing Ctrl + R.
