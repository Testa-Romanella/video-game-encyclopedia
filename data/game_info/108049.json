I love the kitschy visuals, and the various themes that you can unlock keep you motivated to play. I enjoy ambient music, so the soundtrack is delightful. On top of it all, the ability to play the game as you please in any order you want is great, and honestly, I wish more games allowed you to do that. It\u2019s just not much fun being stuck and frustrated on a level with no other options. Fliplomacy is a must for any puzzle lovers.\u201d</em>\n<p><em><em>\u2013\u00a0</em><strong><em>9.1/10 AppAdvice.com</em></strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Full Review</strong></p>\n<em>\u201cThis is a great puzzle game that deserves more attention from fans.
