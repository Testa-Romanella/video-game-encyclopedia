If you click away from it your inputs won't be directed there anymore.<br/></p>\n\r\nDownloading the Rom\r\n<p>If you'd like to download the rom file to play on your device, keep in mind that it's *<em>not*</em>\u00a0an executable, but needs an emulator capable of running Gameboy or Gameboy Color roms.\u00a0You can download one of these for free through a quick Google search. I've heard people really like MyOldBoy, and I personally use bgb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're confused, think of a rom as the game itself and an emulator as the game system used to play it-- digital versions of\u00a0a physical Gameboy and the game cartridge used with it.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to make a donation through this same means (the 'download now' button). It will encourage me to develop other projects like this in the future.</p>\n<p>God bless!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84d71b6e96ef82e2a89fbadae2f22b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sweet Egg Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
