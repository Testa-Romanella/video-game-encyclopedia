Today's the day I\u00a0climb outta here.\" Even though you have a ball and chain tied to your back, you can still climb the wall and escape the prison. Click to climb toward the cursor, and smash any lights along the way for bonus points. Be sure to keep hitting the ball, though, otherwise it'll drag you right off the wall!</p>\n<p>If you're having trouble balancing the ball, try taking it slow for the first few hits and just focus on stabilizing the ball. There's no need to rush early on since the initial combo timer is pretty lenient.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video in the sidebar to see the game in action.</p>\n<p>All art and programming done by PeaQueueAre</p>\n<p>Background music:</p>\n<p>Final Punch -\u00a0Track 1: Intro<br/></p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/final-punch</p>\n<p>All sound effects obtained from\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T08:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1aa/1aa6c80346c8d02bc6c8a3ab4ee73fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PeaQueueAre"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
