Two weeks?! I tried but failed, and this much was after tossing it aside for a year or two and then coming back to sort it out. I'm glad that I managed to make it to a demo release, it has been a lot of work for a newbie developer like me. I hope these ISOI gods forgive this non-artist\u00a0for using their character sprites Ellis. I love Ellis' sprites so so soo very much. &lt;3 Thank you for your awesomeness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:30:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d704a5704b21c02fe039e3f52ef11be5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yuu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
