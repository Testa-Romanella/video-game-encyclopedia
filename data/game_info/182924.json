{"id": 182924, "slug": "laguna-solaris", "name": "Laguna Solaris", "name_original": "Laguna Solaris", "description": "<p>Laguna Solaris is a score attack shmup where you currently try to survive for as long as possible, or get as good of a score as possible.<br/></p><p>THE WEB VERSION DOES NOT WORK SUPER WELL SO I SUGGEST DOWNLOADING THE WINDOWS OR OS X BUILD!<br/><br/>Enemy placement is random but with the spawn interval on a time-scaling difficulty level. The plan is to make a bunch of different \"stages\", with more enemies, bullets and power-ups etc., and keep a separate scoreboard for each of them. Eventually I want to make a full Judgement Silversword-y arcade mode where about half the stages are just this survival mode for a specific amount of time, and half have specific placements. Plus at least like 5 bosses.<br/><br/>Some more details:<br/><br/>Controls: </p><p>Arrow Keys or 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L'<br/>Ctrl or 'X' to Fire/Confirm<br/>'A' to toggle autofire on/off</p><p>It uses a fixed 144x160 resolution (\"GameBoy in Tate-mode\") that is scaled up. No stupid sub-pixel movement or anything. I started using the Pico-8 palette of 16 colors, but I did add a few more colors to it.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on proximity to enemy (along vertical axis) as well as how low the enemy is on the screen when it is killed - the lower the enemy is on the screen, the more points. This is mostly to spice it up a bit, and since it's harder to stay alive if you let enemies survive to get to the bottom of the screen as their bullets will eat more screen space.<br/><br/>You can only die from colliding with bullets, not enemies. Your hitbox is, of course, the red square in the middle of your ship.<br/><br/>It gets more and more difficult the longer you survive - you advance to the next difficulty level every 10 seconds. Balancing wise I tried making it pretty easy to survive the first 30 seconds (though you can always go for higher scoring to make this more difficult), having it be at least a bit of a challenge to make it to 60 seconds, and then having the game being pretty difficult after that.<br/><br/>High Scores and longest survival time should be saved between sessions.<br/><br/>Obviously I like shmups a lot but one big inspiration is the japanese game TKKN: http://homepage1.nifty.com/bee/tk/ , where you just try and avoid getting hit by asteroids for as long as possible. It's very easy to just fire up and play for a minute or two here and there. Geometry Wars 2's Pacifism mode is also great.<br/><br/>Any feedback is much appreciated!</p><p>Change Log:</p><p>v07 - 20160717:</p><p>-- Tweaked scoring a bit, shooting enemies in the lower half of the screen is now worth more points than before</p><p>v 05 &amp; 04 - 20160716:</p><p>-- Tweaked difficult and added 'X' and 'IJKL' as additional inputs, as well as 'A' for autofire toggle on/off</p><p>v 03:</p><p>-- Added sound effect when dying</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c61f7c70fff3eded0de4e69d35d100a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["neontropics"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
