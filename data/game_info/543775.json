Then you can get onboard any one of the boats (or saiboat), modify the wind/wave conditions, time of day and go sail! Great for learning HOW to sail....especially upwind! You can also set up markers and race against the computer-driven boats.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a5049dfbb07f4c7d64671ce0456ff67c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["papaysailor"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
