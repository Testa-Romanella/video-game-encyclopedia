All you have to do is melt it and send it down the collector.<br/><br/>Play over 100 levels, composed of timed, moves limited, ingredient collecting and puzzle levels.<br/>Use bonuses and boosters to help you get a bigger score or simply help you finish the more tricky puzzle levels.<br/><br/>In each level you guide molten chocolate to a collector. You do this by selecting a starting chocolate piece and connect this molten piece to another one of the same type. You can also use the type bonus to link a type of chocolate to another type and score bigger this way.<br/><br/>In order to make your life easier you also can use a moves/time bonus that gives you 5 more moves or 15 additional seconds.<br/>The random bonus needs to be connected to a chocolate chain and it will remove 3 other random pieces of the same type, once it's collected.<br/>And to help you most in the moments that you are stuck you have the bomb bonus and clear bonus, both of those will remove many chocolates when you collect them from the field.<br/><br/>In<strong> limited moves</strong> types of levels you have to reach a certain score within a limited number of moves.<br/>The <strong>timed</strong> levels play similar to the limited moves levels, but you play against time.<br/>For <strong>ingredient</strong> levels, you must get candies from the top of the board all the way down or in a collector.<br/><strong>Puzzle</strong> levels will put your strategic thinking to the test, by having you clear jelly puddles by collecting the chocolate on top of them in a certain number of moves.<br/><br/>Each day you can roll the wheel for various rewards. Compete with your friends for the biggest highscore.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T02:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a1a2e3866ddc96070a5ff4167610207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["games mill"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["games mill"], "esrb_rating": null}
