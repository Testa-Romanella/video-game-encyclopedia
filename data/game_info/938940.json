(F for floral, P for produce, B for bakery, M for meat)<br/></p>\n<p>The player can carry 5 stacks of items at a time, and they can be the same stack. \u00a0(e.g. a stack of 6 apples and a stack of 2 apples).</p>\n<p>When your inventory is full, or you've gathered the requested items, run to the conveyor belt and press Q to drop the items on the belt, and they will get scanned at the register.\u00a0 Once all items have been gathered, interact (E) with the computer screen at the checkout to complete the transaction.\u00a0 If you don't want to do the current list, you can interact with the router/modem sitting on the checkout counter to skip to the next customer. \u00a0You will not gain any time from doing so.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The player gains 1 second for every correct item scanned, and loses .5 of a second for each incorrect item. \u00a0Upon successful completion of the transaction, the player gains seconds equal to the amount of items scanned for that transaction.</p>\n<p>The game is over when the timer reaches 0.<br/></p><p><strong>Note<br/></strong></p><p>This is a very early version of the game that is probably the bare minimum to be considered playable. \u00a0I plan on at least filling out the rest of the store in the next couple of months and potentially changing up the shopper's behavior, but I don't expect this to really be a fully-fledged game. \u00a0It was more of a passion project to create the smallest thing that I would still play to inspire me to continue development. \u00a0Positive/constructive feedback is appreciated, as well as comments for bugs!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T14:35:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f80e7c952e2bf02a1f32618ca1114d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["sirByrt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
