It follows the optional theme of \"Lost\" and is told entirely through text and choices. Besides four \"actual\" endings that depend on some of your choices during the game, there are over twenty ways to meet an untimely end before you ever reach Grandma's house, along with well over 10k words of story.</p>\n<p>How far can you get through the woods?</p>\n<p>(Note:\u00a0Due to the sprawling nature of the woods, some bugs may still hide within. Any reports will be much appreciated.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5bad28bdee5cc9acf05b8b080f00bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kuismai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
