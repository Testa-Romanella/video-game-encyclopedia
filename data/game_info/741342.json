Only to find out your awaited Heaven is full of slimes. Many accepted this paradise; living alongside the slimes in their abodes. But one man, Luis Sipher, chose to rebel against this order. Having cleared his paradise home of the slimes that haunted it, he started up a business to do the same for all who wanted it. Follow Luis on his latest job, as he faces the onslaught preventing Heaven\u2019s latest arrivals from moving in through the course of this arcadey top-down shooter. Armed with only a makeshift plasmatic propulsion pistol, make short work of your Heavenly foes as you dodge the charging slimes and the discharges of the punk rock slimes.</p>\n<p><strong>Created By -</strong></p>\n<p>Programmers:</p>\n<ul><li>John Branton</li><li>Logan Pribyl</li><li>Dylan Hestwood</li><li>Zach Eason</li></ul>\n<p>Artist:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Kyle Solverson</li><li>Alexander Ewell</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T11:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/791acced98416f3886ff31fc9819197a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zoc"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
