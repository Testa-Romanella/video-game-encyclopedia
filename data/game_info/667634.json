No code is used but just basic geometry, rigid bodies, colliders, etc.</p>\n<p>The goal is to distribute all glowing bodies to their corresponding boxes. With one falling ball, all glowing bodies are in place.\r\n</p>\n<p>I found the cone shape in the Asset Store and discovered a \u2018Halo\u2019 component that can make objects glow. By doing this project, I figure out that Unity still has a lot of components and game objects for me to explore, and it has huge potential for game designing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7115b5e4d75495666f73aa1a3c8a2a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yz5698"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
