The vault between you and your partner(yourself, trust no-one) must not be damaged as you have been paid top dollars for the contents!</p>\n<p>The game is a topdown shooter where you control two spaceships at once with asymmetrical controls. Keep shooting down enemies as the screen quickly fills with enemy attacks. The only way to get damaged is by enemies or bullets hitting the vault swinging between the ships. Swinging the vault into your enemies deals massive damage and rewards you with a score multiplier! But watch a\u00f3ut as it also damages it.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Coding: Alexander Norgren, Martin Yxberg, Fox Hamr\u00e9n and Adam Temmel</p>\n<p>Art: Caronela and Fox Hamr\u00e9n<br/></p>\n<p>Music and sound: Joel Skoglund and Adam Temmel</p>\n\n<p>Special Thanks to Tom Francis and the Unity forums!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:16:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596afd9d0fe0e78478031a89175c7a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dustfoxx"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
