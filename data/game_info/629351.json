This game is a funny way to learn different characters used in japanese language (hiraganas, katakanas and kanjis), aswell as a few vocabulary words.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on the ability to find the right character (or word) among others which are displayed at the same time. The character/word to find is pronounced and also written in romaji (phonetic way to write japanese is latin alphabet) or as the translated word (french only). The game has two game modes : \"Learning Mode\", used to learn and memorize the characters and words, and \"Time Attack Mode\", a more Arcade mode where you must have as much good answers in a row as you can in a given time.</p>\n<p>This project was my first experience with Unity and C# language, which I learned to use by myself. I have done all the code of this game, and also\u00a0all the graphisms using Gimp.</p>\n<p>GitHub link :\u00a0https://github.com/nathanchevenard/Nihongo-no-Samurai</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:15:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e072c09faa4a2f0b2611fc429eaa8dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaakao"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
