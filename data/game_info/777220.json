It is a personal journal that allows me to open up to my classmates about my struggles and success in life. Inspired by the openness of others in the class, I wanted to break out of my comfort zone and try producing something personal as well. If you are interested in playing, feel free to, I just wanted to supply some context to the game. I\u00a0hope you enjoy and find meaning out of this game.\u00a0<br/><br/>It plays as a choose-your-own-adventure, text based game, with choices intended to simulate interactions between the journal and the reader.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T12:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aab96baf57646fcef69ba842a561beba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LoonyGoober"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
