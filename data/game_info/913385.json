All objects are projected from a 2D top down map to try to create a pseudo 3D world. World objects will move around the player as you change the camera rotation. It creates a really nice effect, but I also put a lot of mathematical workarounds to really get the game going. There\u2019s still a lot with the game that I\u2019m figuring out, but the game came out pretty good. I would go into a lot of technical detail, but this post is already pretty long as it is.<br/></p>\n<p>The game itself is really focused on RPG aesthetics, with many inspirations from the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series games. But more specifically, what really inspired the mechanics and art direction is some of my favorite game devs on Twitter like Galof Manron\u00a0and Faxdoc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created in 2 weeks on Flowlab.io for Winter Flowjam 2023. All sounds and music comes from Flowlab, and the artist is a friend of mine that goes by Glowbug.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Having Performance Issues?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are experiencing any issue, please let me know what browser, device you are using, and make sure hardware acceleration is on in the browser.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The download link below will help run the game better locally for Windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://flowlab.io/assets/users/62/user_622236/game_2202241/windows.zip?stamp=16...</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c53/c53f90cf0b24cc1b4b46c9b198d7d709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JR 01 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
