{"id": 845912, "slug": "whole-gamejam", "name": "WHole (GameJam)", "name_original": "WHole (GameJam)", "description": "<p>Created for the 10th Pirate Software Game Jam.\u00a0<br/>Short 2D, Side-Scrolling Platfromer. The main twists are that the game is more about grabbing surfaces to make jumps and\u00a0that pits don't provide game-overs or reset the level. They take you to the next level. The game loops until all the keys are collected.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>I originally made it Keyboard only, but mine didn't work on my export, so I added Controller\u00a0support, and that for sure works. Uses the face buttons, left stick, down dpad, plus the bumpers. For keyboards (if it chooses to work for you): WASD, arrow keys, and space bar are all that are used.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/>5 Looping levels<br/>1 Enemy type that probably won't kill you<br/>Grabbable walls<br/>15 <em>things </em>to collect</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong><br/>All the walls flicker because my sprite work hates me.<br/>There's no audio. I didn't have time to make any.<br/>No options, pausing, or menus. Just ALT+F4 when it's quitting time.<br/>Sometimes getting stuck grabbing when too close to wall. You can dive out though.<br/>Sometimes lose momentum when diving.<br/>Sometimes getting launched after diving onto an enemy.<br/>It's possible to buffer the attacks, so don't spam in every direction.<br/>It is possible for the character to rotate when grappling with corners.<br/>It is possible to out of bounds on Level 1. There's nothing up there.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>This was a solo project, so everything good and every fault are all mine. You can't have any of them. You can play the game though. I gave up halfway through the Jam because I wasted 2 days on the level loader and didn't have that much free time for the 2 week period the jam ran, but I got the 2nd weekend back to be able to work on it and swore I would finish the game enough. I did that and I made this. Thanks for playing if you did.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b8416c7110f994e0def6a290161977dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Y."], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
