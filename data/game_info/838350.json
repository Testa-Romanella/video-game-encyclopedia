If you mess up, I recommend you wait to fall of or get on the collectors before you reset to avoid having to encounter this bug.</p><p>If you do encounter the bug, sorry about that, you'll have to restart the entire game :(</p>\n<p>Submission for Wowie Jam 4.0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a puzzle game where you have to use AI, self-driving\u00a0vacuum cleaners to clean the floating island. If you fall off, however, your vacuums will merrily fall into a void to never be seen again (unless you press space to restart of course, because you have admin powers over this world, mostly anyway). Place obstacles to stop the vacuum cleaners from going off, the map, as they turn when there is something in front of them (including another vacuum!).\r\n</p>\n<p>Sorry there are only 8 levels (including tutorial levels) but hopefully that shall suffice.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is a tutorial in the game but the control's are here anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Building:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Note: You can only build\u00a0when the vacuums are not running, and you cannot build on dust, map occupied tiles, or the vacuums starting position\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Mouse-Button: Build obstacle\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Mouse-Button: Delete obstacle\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Other Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Space: Play/Restart\r\n</p>\n<p>Enter: Next Level (Only when you win the level you are currently on)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Stuff Used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Map Tiles, made by Buch, can be found on open game art:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/the-field-of-the-floating-islands\r\n</p>\n<p>Vacuum Noises:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4sLR1OCDaY<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/059bef5e18321352550ee3eba58bc037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["TheUnknown1050"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
