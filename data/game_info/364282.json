This game is in active development, this page is for feedback.</p><p>Leave a comment below if you beat my HIGHSCORE: 145,400.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>ONLY ONE MINUTE:</p>\n<p>One LIFE.\u00a0One BULLET.\u00a0One MINUTE.\u00a0One...\u00a0HUNDRED enemies!</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Typical top-down shooter controls, but the twist is that you need to collect the bouncing\u00a0\"bullet\" after shooting it.\u00a0Other than that, all the mechanics are pretty straightforward. Don't run out of time, get a highscore, and have FUN!</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam. I spent around 16 hours building this game, since I only had\u00a0Friday night and Sunday morning to work on it. I think I did alright.</p>\n<p>I do have one released game under my belt:\u00a0Ballistic Tanks\u00a0which is on Steam. But I have zero programming knowledge\u00a0so I use the Construct 2 engine which is really easy for noobs like me.</p>\n<p>This game, Only One Minute, will be in active development and might be releasing it for free/cheap on Steam in the future. So please give me some more feedback!</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out the game! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T05:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/110/110a1226caba7595608e4d23b9ec492c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KirklightGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
