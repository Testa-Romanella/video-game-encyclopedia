Bandits and thieves aren't as fearsome as another, more subtle and more deceiving enemy: time! Unable to outrace it, during his journey he must learn to exploit this fiend to his advantage. Never shall he forget its detrimental power: youthful strength and speed aren't ever lasting, but with age comes knowledge, too. And who is willing to reject a gift such as magic? Throughout his quest he will learn powerful spells, which he shall use wisely to augment his tactical mastery and thus, tilting the wheels of fortune to his side. As the time goes on, he will need every single bit of help he can get and no one should underestimate luck. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50513726167e331861fd458a3555938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
