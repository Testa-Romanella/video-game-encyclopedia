{"id": 965444, "slug": "sonic-classic-heroes", "name": "Sonic Classic Heroes", "name_original": "Sonic Classic Heroes", "description": "<p>Sonic Classic Heroes is a ROM hack for the Sega Mega Drive that is the result of a collaboration between flamewing and ColinC10, combining their respective hacks Sonic 2 Heroes and Sonic 1 and 2. It therefore is a single ROM that offers the entire campaigns of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, either alone or together; and enables the player to play as many characters such as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The hack is named due to the ability to control a team of characters, which is reminiscent of the more recent 3D game Sonic Heroes.</p>\n<p>The hack is built on Sonic 2\u2019s engine, which has been enhanced by both flamewing and ColinC10 to have new features. These include: multiple gameplay elements from Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, such as element shields and character-specific abilities; the ability to save progress, scores, etc. to SRAM (something rarely implemented in Sonic 2, with the other notable example being Esrael\u2019s Sonic 2 Delta); various bug-fixes and improvements to the mechanics of the original games; and many more features, both implemented and planned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-25T18:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b68164db7f3ef9eb533ac8a9346fda0f.jpg", "website": "https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Classic_Heroes", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
