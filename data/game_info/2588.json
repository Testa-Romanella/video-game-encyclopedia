The game\u2019s dialogues, items descriptions, and overall style are filled with humor, parody, and references to iconic video game series. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main feature of the game is unlocking of graphical, sound and gameplay improvements. The game starts as a monochrome top-down adventure with no sound and gradually, as the player progresses through the story, transforms into full-fledged 3D RPG with soundtrack, different settlements throughout the game world, side-quests, NPCs and equipment system. <br />\nEvoland\u2019s gameplay continually changes. It can be divided into three main parts, each one resembling a certain game series. The first is top-down adventure similar to older The Legend of Zelda titles. Like Zelda, it features different puzzles and dungeons throughout the game. Then the game changes its combat system to turn-based imitating Final Fantasy series with its random encounters and party system. After that, it becomes the top-down hack-n-slash game in the style of Diablo series with the accent on obtaining various loot.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2013-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T12:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b291197d50dea8e6c9cb7f7eb6d2242d.jpeg", "website": "http://evoland.shirogames.com/", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 1211, "beaten": 233, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 61, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 161, "ratings_count": 268, "suggestions_count": 587, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 272, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "Android", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital", "Playdigious", "Shiro Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Playdigious", "Shiro Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
