I created this piece as a submission for an interactive fiction and computer games course after originally wanting to write something more dark and emotionally stirring, possibly even triggering for some people.</p>\n<p>I decided against it in the end because I realized, while I knew the other subject matter very well on a personal level, I couldn't make balance the emotionally stirring aspects with aspects of fun. Possessed is the product of that decision.</p>\n<p>So I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/6688f98c4db3ce6c1cc4cae4830c0f22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emmasgames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
