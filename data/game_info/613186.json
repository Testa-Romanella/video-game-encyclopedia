It's 100%\u00a0free, and it uses the sprites and sounds of the original game so you can feel the escence of the classic Doom.\u00a0It also contains an Infinite Level where you can kill monsters indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's only one level, but I\u00a0tried to add\u00a0every possible detail so it looks exactly the same, I also tried to make the gameplay fun. So please, give me feedback so I\u00a0can improve in the future!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>AWSD to move</li><li>'Shift' to run</li><li>'3' to equip the Shotgun</li><li>'5' to equip the Rocket Launcher</li><li>'e' to open doors/secrets</li><li>'space' jump\u00a0(yes, you can, but you shouldn't!)</li><li>'u' to hide the UI</li><li>'p' or 'ESC' to pause and open the Menu (you can change the\u00a0Mouse Sensitivity)</li><li>'t' to restart.
