Each year one of the friends creates a board game to play. We've had a papercraft game, a board game made of building blocks and one with big castles that are normally used for aquariums. Last year it was my (Niekoe) turn. The idea was that everytime my friends beated a game board they had to play a level in a video game. So I asked my colleague from work (CrasyBoy) to help create an awesome video game for that board game weekend.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We had a blast creating Thunderday and the game grew bigger and bigger. Adding more levels and even a highscore game for the friends to compete in. <br/><br/>Eventually on game day Thunderday was a great success and my friends asked if we could release the game. We expanded and improved the game and now we are glad we can show Thunderday to the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-12T03:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa182dbb667eb2e04ebc6f847168ca1.jpg", "website": "https://www.robotcatgames.com/#/video-game/Thunderday", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["RobotCat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RobotCat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
