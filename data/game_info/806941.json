The most notable code is for the NPCs, listed below.</p>\n<p>The code works with two objects in tandem: the NPC itself that gets determines the accurate textbox\u00a0and a GUI object that actually outputs the text associated with the correct textbox.</p>\n<p>Relevant NPC code:</p>\r\n\r\n// textbox &amp; interaction handler\r\nif (obj_pl1.key_interact &amp;&amp; distance_to_object(obj_pl1) &lt;= range)\r\n{\r\n    switch (obj_pl1.quest1)\r\n    {\r\n        case 0:\r\n            obj_pl1.quest1 = 1;\r\n            textbox = 1;\r\n            break;\r\n        case 1:\r\n            if (obj_pl1.shells &lt; shellsNeeded)\r\n            {\r\n                textbox = 2;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (obj_pl1.shells &gt;= shellsNeeded)\r\n            {\r\n                obj_pl1.quest1 = 2;\r\n                obj_pl1.shells -= shellsNeeded;\r\n                textbox = 3;\r\n                instance_create_layer(x + 16, y, \"Interactables\", obj_sandcastle);\r\n            }\r\n            break;\r\n        case 2:\r\n            textbox = 4;\r\n            break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n<p>Relevant\u00a0GUI code:</p>\r\n\r\n// npc1 textbox\r\nswitch (obj_npc1.textbox)\r\n{\r\n    case 1:\r\n        draw_sprite_ext(spr_npc1, 0, 42, 540, 2, 2, 0, c_white, 1);\r\n        draw_text_ext_color(64, 525, \"I sure wish I had some seashells to finish my sandcastle!
