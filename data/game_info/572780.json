Special delivery: 1 hydrogen fuel cell with enough juice to kick the  station out of this pesky atmosphere and back into space where it  belongs.     </em><br/></p>\n<p><em> Back home your buddies are placing bets on whether you'll make it back alive. Last you heard, odds were 5 to 1 against.   </em><br/></p>\n<p><em> \"Docking complete,\" sounds a lifeless mechanical voice. No word yet from the station crew. Comms must be down. Figures. Shouldering your pack containing the fuel cell, you trudge into the airlock. Gotta lug this thing down the five flights of stairs to the fuel bay. Who designed this place?   </em><br/></p>\n<p><em> A dim light flickers on in the airlock revealing words smeared in blood on the opposite door: \"<strong>DON'T OPEN!
