Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2: Battle had the Tiny Chao Garden. The Steam releases of those games have... nothing! That's where this project comes in. Designed to use the .chao format introduced by Fusion's Chao Editor and utilized by krzys2's Chao Exporter/Importer, this game allows you to interact with your Chao just like in the original Tiny Chao Garden!<br/></p>\n<p>More than just a simple recreation, Tiny Chao Garden DX has new enhancements and will feature more in the future! You can view a Chao's stats by opening the full menu, view item stats and descriptions in the shop and store your goods in a new inventory system. Currently, there are two minigames- Chao Match and Chao Janken, both appearing in version 1 of the original TCG- and more minigames familiar and new will be added down the line. In addition, I plan to add additional Gardens so you can house up to four Chao at one time!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T14:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbf1b88b12083a34f1d0c3faa018b75a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["domobot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
