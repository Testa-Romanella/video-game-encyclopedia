It&#39;s creepy, scary, horror and<br />\nincredibly hard. So hard, that you can and should expect to die dozens<br />\nof times. My inspiration was thing such as Darkseed, Silent Hill,<br />\nHellraiser, Event Horizon, Shivers and Lovecraft. Antumbra is also a very special &quot;child&quot; to me. Because I&#39;ve made it<br />\nmostly for myself. Because right now, I am having a very difficult time<br />\nin my life. And I had to vent. So I took all my nightmares, my fears, my<br />\nanger, sorrow and misery... And I turned it into a game. Antumbra is<br />\nthe most personal creation I ever made.It&#39;s also my first game, that I made from scratch, and finished - all<br />\nby myself. The game was supposed to be a lot bigger and with RPG<br />\nelements but I had to cut that out due to lack of time. And It&#39;s also<br />\nthe first adventure game I ever tried developing. I would like to make<br />\nAntumbra 2, with better graphics and longer gameplay but I have no idea<br />\nwould anybody actually play it. So here&#39;s this. If you would like more -<br />\nplease follow me wherever I am, specially at facebook, as its my<br />\nprimary communication channel. Please support me - and I&#39;ll make more.<br />\nIf you had enjoy the ride - let me now.<br />\nAnd if not? Well, then maybe go play CoD or Cookie Clicker or some other crap - I don&#39;t care :PPS: If you guys would be interested I can stitch an OST from Antumbra. But only if enough people will request.<br />\nKudos, have fun and see you at the Crossroad of Rust and Moss.<br />\n/DroneLocker [EXTRA TAGS]<br />\nhorror, surreal, scary, creepy, creepypasta, adventure game, point and<br />\nclick, hard, difficult, dark souls, dronelocker, nightmare, fear,<br />\nmedals, cicada 3301</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T00:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb488c703bfeb5c6099b52e9d4618dc.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/654784", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DroneLocker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
