You can find the original jam version in the downloads section.</p>\r\nHow to play<p>There is an interactive in-game tutorial, but here is a short break-down of the game mechanics:</p>\n<ul><li>Protect the core in the centre against incoming bullets.</li><li>Use the paddles to catch bullets. A bullet can only be caught with a paddle of the same colour.</li><li>Each time you catch a bullet, the paddles swap colours.</li><li>Each time you catch a bullet, you can also fire one bullet back. You can't hit enemies directly -- instead, aim for the\u00a0thin hitpoints at the edge of the circle. A hitpoint can only be damaged by a bullet of the same colour.</li><li>Over time, the game will shrink, and you will need to react faster.</li><li>Each time a bullet reaches the core, one of its rings will be destroyed.<br/>The game is over when all rings are destroyed.</li><li>Once all enemy hitpoints are destroyed, you move on to the next level.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Control the paddles with [A]/[D] and [left]/[right]</p><p>Fire bullets with [W] and [up]</p>\n<p>[ESC] to pause / quit</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The circular font is based on @Managore's m3x6 font.</p>\n<p>Tweening uses Kikto's excellent neonate.lua.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b270740bd592241e0f6acea7c925fabd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moritz Neikes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
