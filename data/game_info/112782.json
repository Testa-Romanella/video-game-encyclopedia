Fly through space and dodge the spud-looking asteroids. Currently available for Windows and OS X.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimple controls are the best. One button will boost your ship up, and when you let go you will fall back down. Use any key on your keyboard, the left mouse button, or if you have a Playstation 3 Dualshock controller hooked up to your system, you can use the 'X' button.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tI made this game in my spare time while working a full time job and being a good husband and father at home. I couldn't have done it without the work that many others put into the tools that I use. I make my games with HaxeFlixel, a wonderful cross-platform 2D game engine. All graphic assets are courtesy of Kenney, who makes tons of free art for developers who lack the skills. The background music was made with Figure for iOS, and the sound effects were made with Bfxr. </p>\n<p>\r\n\tI would love your support in buying, downloading, and more importantly PLAYING this game. That's why I made it in the first place. If you enjoy the game, please consider buying the downloadable version or the source.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/51075f1791e4e2579e77db1e581349f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jonathan Hirz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
