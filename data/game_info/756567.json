You Pilot the Peace Hawk, a 6 DOF vehicle with VTOL capabilities and a multitude of weaponry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Its your first day on the job with the Police Force and you cant wait to patrol the skies. There are a lot of people that don't think the law applies to them, they race around the city at dangerous speeds, rob banks, join gangs and terrorize businesses. Its your job to take them down with any means necessary and make them pay for their crimes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Police force is a private company that hires freelancers and you get paid per job instead of a salary. Use it on your ship and upgrade its performance, handling, scanners and weapons, to take on any task. <br/><br/><br/><br/>You will have to patrol the city and use your radar to find speeders, scan for contraband and stop armed gangs from expanding their operations. Visit the local street food vendors to get tips on what is happening, just make sure to order 'the special'<br/><br/><br/><br/>When you have saved a little, you can spoil yourself with a nice car or two. Maybe even an apartment to call your own.
