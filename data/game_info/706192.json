{"id": 706192, "slug": "nightmare-arena", "name": "Nightmare Arena", "name_original": "Nightmare Arena", "description": "<p>This is my second attempt at making a series of free, short RPGs that I call \"Side Quests.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p>So basically, you play as someone who is sort of like a  cop, but not really. Sort of like a bug tester... But not really. She's  like... Sort of like, cyber crime division? Cyber terrorism division?  But not quite. The agency (not mentioned in game) has investigated a  string of deadly accidents happening within the Virtual Reality world.  So, her job (your job) is to enter the Arena and find the \"Shift Zone,\" a  place in the virtual world where things are broken down and exposed -  typically where hackers do their thing. The stakes here are, if she  (you) doesn't find the Shift Zone... Everyone in the arena will die in  real life.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, shifting  into the virtual world, you must take on the arena, train by fighting  arena monsters and other arena combatants to level your character and  conquer the arena. Be the Arena Victor, earn the Arena Card so you can  move on to stronger arenas (not in game) and finally put a stop the  cyber terrorists.\r\n</p>\n<p>During  the game you will be exploring a small park (Ossein Park Arena,  basically Bone Park Arena but you can probably guess why I didn't want  to call it that...) of darkness and death. By fighting other Arena  Challengers you get Voltage (money) and one of their skills. By end game  you will have a skill form every other challenger in your arsenal.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You  have 3 weapons and 3 armor sets to choose from, which you get from the  equipment guys. Each has their own little strengths and weaknesses and  each comes with their own skill. For example, one weapon may come with a  skill that is powered by both Focus (magic) Attack and Agility, while  another weapon may come with a skill that is only powered by Agility. So  then you must decide how to build your character depending on what  skills you want. But beware, when you invest in one skill, the others  will fall far behind (unless you spend more time becoming balanced,  which takes longer).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You  will be facing an onslaught of Arena Monsters which will keep coming at  you (they respawn after 1 minute on field, it resets if you leave and  come back). So between these monsters and the challengers, you will  always have something to fight and strengthen yourself against.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>So can you do it? Can you both be the Arena Victor and put a stop to the threat of the Cyber Terrorists?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa55a1dd3d69869683f0c24cb113bbdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpicyNoodleStudios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
