Toddy loves a tall tale, and free beer!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In each encounter you can keep rolling the dice to increase the number of enemies Toddy faced, and benefit from increased interest from Patrons (round multiplier). But you must temper Ben's suspicions by knowing when to increase the number of enemies by a little or a lot; predict whether your next roll will be higher or lower than the previous roll.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Brag too much, and Ben will call you out on it. Brag too little, and Ben may lose interest! Bank your current score to end the encounter and collect your beer.
