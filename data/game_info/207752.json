Press F11 to Full Screen it!)<br/> Ok, this game was supposed to have more levels, more exploration, more enemies, more bosses and more everything... But it didn't. I had all the mechanics done, a second level done, but for the time sake i made some cutbacks (a lot of) to finish the game to the compo. Tomorrow i'll work, so the jam is not possible. I felt like i cheated the Ludum Dare, giving a so cheap and incomplete alpha of a game. But i had to finish it, my second LD without a game. NO! This have to finish now! So whith you...
