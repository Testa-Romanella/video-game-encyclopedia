An experiment, made in slightly too few hours for Ludum Dare 34 (the Jam).</p><p>Charge up your beams and tag the other dancer(s) with them to complete the ritual. </p>Controls<p>The ritual only has a few movements, using the keyboard. You can:</p><ul><li>fire your light beams</li><li>conjure a shield to deflect the other beams</li><li>dash along your path</li></ul><p><strong>{Z} </strong>- switch the active movement<br/></p><p><strong>{X}</strong> - press and hold to charge. When you see the yellow flowers, release to perform the active movement.<br/></p>Notes<p>The shield has a ridiculously slow charge rate - you have to hold the button down for a few seconds for it to activate (you can tell when it's available when the particle effects turn to flowers).</p><p>This may be edited in a later version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/9550e55cf0c6ff6386dc836c5cfbe26a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amorphous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
