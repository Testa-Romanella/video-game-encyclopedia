We never played a text-adventure before, nor we ever used the Adventuron engine to create games, but when we saw the competition here on Itch we decided to participate. <br/>\r\nInitially we planned the whole game, then I developed the code and she created the main illustration. We did not manage to polish things up as much as we wanted: some areas are quite empty, some passages may be confusing and we did not find the time to add more characters and descriptions. <br/>\r\nIt was also our first time using Itch and developing a full game in general, hence the basic form of this page.\r\n</p>\r\n Hints \r\n<p> Some characters may say something different when prompted to talk more than once. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6df454fb6b4ecba8b566816180675b99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sanjuro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
