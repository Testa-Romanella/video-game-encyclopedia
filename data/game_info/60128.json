Mamiko is beautiful, intelligent, compassionate\u2026 and completely out of Azusa\u2019s league!<br/><br/>Azusa has long since resigned herself to the cold, hard reality that Mamiko will never return her feelings, and she\u2019s fine with it! At least, that\u2019s what she tells herself \u2013 until she receives a text message one night from the mysterious \u2018Venus\u2019.<br/>Word around the campus is that Venus can use her perplexing powers to bring any two people together, irregardless of how incompatible they may seem. Before Venus will help Azusa, however, our heroine needs to prove her unyielding affection towards her crush.<br/><br/>And how is Azusa going to do that\u2026?<br/>She has to take a candid photograph of Mamiko\u2019s panties, of course!<br/>Will Azusa succumb to Venus\u2019 devilish temptations? Will Mamiko ever fall in love with her? Or are the rumors surrounding Venus complete and utter nonsense?<br/><br/>No matter what happens, Azusa\u2019s bound to have an exciting semester filled with intrigue, deception, and up-skirt photography!<br/><br/><br/>The heroine of the story. Azusa may be a student at the prestigious Victoria Academy of Music, but she doesn\u2019t take her studies seriously. She would far rather stare at the cute girls in her local maid caf\u00e9 than practice the cello.<br/><br/>Azusa\u2019s father is incredibly famous in the world of classical music, and Azusa has a lot to live up to. The professors at her university constantly compare Azusa to her father, much to our heroine\u2019s chagrin, and she\u2019d really rather be judged on her own merits than those of her father\u2019s.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Azusa\u2019s only positive qualities are her exuberant energy and her unerring optimism.<br/><br/><br/>Azusa\u2019s childhood friend. Mari \u2013 or \u2018Marilyn\u2019 - has stood by Azusa\u2019s side through thick and thin. Mari routinely waking Azusa up in the mornings, reminds her about impending deadlines, and helps Azusa study in the university library.<br/><br/>Despite everything Mari does for Azusa, Azusa regards her as a bit of a nag, and wishes she would just lighten up a little.<br/><br/><br/>The object of Azusa\u2019s affections, and the most beautiful girl on the school campus. Mamiko is something of a musical genius, who can play the piano, the clarinet, and the harp, but she never boasts about her great accomplishments.<br/><br/>All the girls in the Victoria Academy want to be like Mamiko, all the boys wish she was their girlfriend, and vice versa. Unfortunately, Mamiko is simply too perfect, and most people are intimidated by her goddess-like demeanour.<br/><br/>Though Mamiko has a large number of fans, she doesn\u2019t have many friends...<br/><br/>That is, until Azusa begins to pursue her.<strong>Features:</strong><ul><li>join Azusa on her love quest</li><li>available in English and in Chinese</li><li>enjoy a cute and funny visual novel</li><li>small choices influence your ending</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-22T19:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8d1f7b2bb5db068be6fa7afd3d62279.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 15, "owned": 194, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
