The theme for the jam was\u00a0<strong>What's hiding\u00a0 in the dark?</strong>. The time limit was\u00a0<strong>48 hours,</strong> of which I only used\u00a0<strong>24 hours</strong>. This is a\u00a0<strong>solo entry</strong>\u00a0and there are\u00a0<strong>no premade assets</strong>. Everything was made by me, with the exception of some of the sound effects (lightning, thunder, footsteps) from freesound.org</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game Design: me\r\n</li><li>Code: me (using Unity &amp; Visual Studio 2019)\r\n</li><li>Music: me (using FL Studio 20 - Producer Edition)\r\n</li><li>Art: me (using Krita)\r\n</li><li>Sound Effects: freesound.org\r\n</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>My YT channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Od4iYshEhNFfgUCRr0ccA\r\n</li><li>You can find and download all my music here:\u00a0https://agentjo.newgrounds.com/\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfc/dfc71755fee7b46cc28a4e440af1f77b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Agent_Jo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
