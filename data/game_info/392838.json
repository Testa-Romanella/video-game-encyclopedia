It'll make sense once you're playing.</p>\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n<p>Made in GMS2 in 48 hours for the GM20th birthday jam. I\u00a0spent the first 5 days trying to make something from a coin based turn based rts idea\u00a0that I\u00a0really wanted to do. But it was boring. So I\u00a0finally gave in and made this. Therefore it's not as polished as normal, but it should run fine - I\u00a0didn't find any bugs in the 10 minutes of testing I did at the end. So, fingers crossed!</p>\r\nSOME LINKS\r\n<p>If you like it - follow me on twitter!\u00a0I hardly use it but, maybe one day I will, and then we can be twitter friends. -&gt;\u00a0Twitter</p>\n<p>If you enjoy - make sure to leave a comment and let me know if you have a game as well.
