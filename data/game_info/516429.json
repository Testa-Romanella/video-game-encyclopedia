You have to use your powers of spreading lies and misinformation to postpone voters as long as possible.</em></em>\n<em><em>How long can you keep it up?</em></em>\n<p>Game is split into days, and you try to survive as many as possible. During each day villagers go about their business and after they finish their tasks they go vote for either Drowning, Burning or Stoning. Your goal is to distract them with conspiracies and lies so they don't get to vote.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Each day you pick two conspiracies (mapped to LMB and RMB)\u00a0that you use to stall the other villagers so they don't get to vote how you die. Keep the voting going as many days as you possibly can before any option gets 20 votes.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Kill Me</strong>\u00a0was created during GDS 2020 Game Jam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b2552edd4ac46f8339699fddb0c04a68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gorgodon", "shashishekhar", "raphaelpont", "JanVan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
