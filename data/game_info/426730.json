I replaced the main characters with the heads of goats, and the bullets with cheese. It was a homage to Jeff Minter and his use of animals in games. It also incorporated, rather unsuccessfully, a power-up system. If two bullets collided they formed a bubble, and shooting the bubble caused your opponent to freeze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It caused balancing issues though, and the collision detection never really worked, so it was scrapped from later games. Due to the complexity of the DRAW statements used for the goats, it also runs slower and there are graphical glitches in DOS Box.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a47da23e94ca398791544a515833235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
