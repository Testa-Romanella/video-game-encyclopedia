{"id": 469853, "slug": "little-wars", "name": "Little Wars", "name_original": "Little Wars", "description": "<p>Update .001: A quick fix for the most egregious, make-it-nigh-unplayable bugs of the original jam submission.</p>\n<p>Update .002: Huge number of bug fixes, quality of life upgrades, etc. as well as two new Units! Val is here to be the anti-Sai, and Mark certainly is a dodgy fellow. Plus all new models, options window, etc.</p>\n<p>Hi there! Thanks for checking out Little Wars, my submission to the Unofficial GMTK 2020 Deadline Missers Jam!</p>\n<p>This game is a simplistic autobattler, in which you the player compete with the machine in increasingly difficult miniature fights.\u00a0If you're not familiar with autobattlers, I'll give you a brief summary:\u00a0in an autobattler, you assemble a team of units that you deploy for combat against an opponent. Though you control the composition of your team and their position/deployment, you do not control how they fight, thus why I was inspired towards this concept for the \"Out of Control\" themed GMTK 2020 jam. The roguelite elements for this game come in the form of persistent units (any units that survive a fight can be used in future fights) and currency (CTRL) carrying over between fights.</p>\n<p>'Start' will lead you through a couple of tutorial levels. 'Infinite' will allow you to simply fight until you lose. Post high scores/strats if you happen to get decently far!</p>\n<p>This game was originally developed for the GMTK 2020 gamejam (big props to the organizers of that event) but after missing the deadline by a significant margin it became a submission to the Unofficial GMTK 2020 Deadline Missers gamejam, where it came very close to missing ANOTHER deadline! Man, I gotta start watching the clock in these things.</p>\n<p>This was likely too ambitiously scoped for a jam like GMTK jam 2020, but it's an idea that's really excited me, and thus I'm planning on continuing development as I move forward.<br/></p>\n<p>Though they're also credited in-game, I'd really like to thank Thavia for all of the 2d art assets and music featured in this game. Additionally, the materials on the ground/walls are free Unity Store Assets. All other assets, including all scripts, were created in the last three days.</p>\n<p>Thanks for stopping by! And I hope you enjoy Little Wars!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708ef2e629b38a47d579ed6df06e0121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrowVendor"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
