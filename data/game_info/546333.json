The brief for the coursework was to create a narrative using Twine with some interactive elements.</p>\n<p>To challenge myself, I researched Twine scripting and built some basic RPG elements. In\u00a0Park Souls, you control a nameless squirrel hero as he battles a variety of animals, collecting acorns and power before attempting\u00a0to defeat the evil (?) woodcutter.\u00a0Featuring soulslike progression,\u00a0text-based combat (loosely inspired by\u00a0Kingdom of Loathing) and an exceptionally odd\u00a0bear.</p>\n<p>The game is very much a prototype with some basic RPG elements and probably some bugs and typo's.\u00a0A special thank you to my kids for the most excellent cover image.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/7685675541808157ec0b21958add7863.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pladda Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
