This is basically a qop clone - press a key to move in that direction until you hit a wall (or slime). Try to get to the finish... but you can kill yourself to make a block to stand on! You can also warp from the left to the right side, vice versa, and up and down. Be careful, though, because there's a limit to the amount of dead bodies you can leave!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\u2191 | W | Numpad 8 - Move up<br/>\u2193 | S | Numpad 2 - Move down<br/>\u2190 | A | Numpad 4 - Move left<br/>\u2192 | D | Numpad 6 - Move right<br/>(Yes, I know that on the Nokia 2 was up and 8 was down, but I wanted to make it more intuitive for PC)</p>\n<p>Spacebar | Enter | Numpad 5 - Turn into a block<br/>If you try to turn into a block while moving, you die without becoming a block and respawn.</p>\n<p>Escape | Numpad 0 - Pause game<br/>R | Numpad '*' - Restart level<br/>Backspace | Q | Numpad '/' - Quit to menu / Quit game (while in menu)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made by 89o<br/>Sound effects compiled by Trix<br/>4x4 font by Groszak<br/>Made for the 2nd Nokia 3310 Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349c0a7fddda7f2ccb0bd19e3430b41c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
