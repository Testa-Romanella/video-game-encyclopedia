We are excited to present the next entry into the Most Boring Series!  Do you miss life pre covid? The fantastic yet boring 9-5 of our existence? Then this is NOT the game for you. This boring game involves you moving around throughout the day during quarantine as you go by living life from getting out of bed to going to your desk to taking a walk in the park until finally coming back to your bed with no end in sight with covid in this endless experience. Think this is going to be a fun game? NOPE. Enjoy the new normal with covid where you will wonder if things will ever get back to normal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe made some updates in gameplay since the last game: <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Choose what you want to do throughout the day. We now provide the ability to have different options of what you want to do and where you want to go next. Players can cycle through different environments and can choose to do what they want throughout the day. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Full day/night cycle letting the player experience all hours of the day. Sleep when you want. Work when you want. Its all the same during a pandemic. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- New scenes! Take a walk in the park (while practicing social distancing) or have a smoke break outside your apartment.We are providing new things you can do in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T03:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f8025bf1a7218f960360ec2b6e045137.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Virtual Sky Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Virtual Sky Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
