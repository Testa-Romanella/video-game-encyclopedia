The game tells the story of Vegetaria, a nation of bunnies under attack from vegetable monsters. Players control a brigade of 4 bunnies - each with their own unique stats and skills - and battle against the monsters in turn-based combat, with the ultimate goal of clearing each area and reclaiming Vegetaria.</p><p>The game is currently in early access. Four areas exist for players to traverse, with a fifth area on its way. The game will actively be updated with bug fixes and revisions until then, so please let us know if you have any feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f7855314f5ef172c359b49deeaa3437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alex Garbus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
