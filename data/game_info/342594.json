With anticipation he observes the culmination of the 33rd Theatre and final battles of the Trigon space war. An event at the edges of the universe between forces unleashed by a temporal shift in the fabric of space and time. Negative agents of an alternate time-line known as the Outribes of Lult emerge onboard five identical astral triangular crafts as pilots of the Zoneplex Defendant Paradigmatics. This final act of warfare, encompassing battles on a pan-plex level, holds the outcome of future timelines on the cusp of explosive singularity. One side will be victorious and one side will be sequestered to the outer reaches of the universe, to begin again and attempt to shift the tides of intra-dimensional struggle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T02:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/061c31a4a5c58ae859183fe477b88e36_aEAlfl9.jpg", "website": "http://www.eriksvedang.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Erik Sved\u00e4ng"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Erik Sved\u00e4ng"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
