Well, except instead of going after Dracula, you\u2019re going after a Nephalim named Daughter who is working to undo the boundaries of reality and myth. And by myth, we really mean all myth -- Abaddon has been designed to host creatures and characters from global mythology, from Norse Draugr to Judeo-Christian Angels, Taoist Cultivators, and Hindi Asura -- anything is game due to the way we\u2019ve designed Abaddon\u2019s world. These Myths are injected into the chaos of 1980s New York, a city run by greed, want, and excess. The clique, the trend, the drug these were king in NYC, and with myth bursting in and inhabiting it, we can explore a provocative and chaotic new frontier. Afterall, the chaos of the setting is not without purpose: It\u2019s an allegory for the times we live in. Chaos, misinformation, manipulation -- these are the plights of our time, and thematics that we as creators can seek to speak to, question, and resolve in an engaging, dramatized manner. Finding a way through the chaos about us, embracing our own independence and power, and building strong and earnest relationships -- this is the Player\u2019s Journey of Abaddon, and the morals we wish to impart onto our players.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:37:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/350/350fc6fdcaf16fb69332b127268ca6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Montague"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
