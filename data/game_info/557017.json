I saw someone post the ripped iconset from RPG Maker Fes on The Spriters Resource website and I wanted to recreate some items I\u00a0thought could be easy to recreate. I ended up recreating and rendering 8 items from the iconset with color variations. In the file download I include the my renders so you guys can check the result and play around with them, they don't look anything special, but when scaled down I feel like they mimic the original iconset pretty well. I\u00a0also made they available in 48x48, 32x32, 24x24.</p>\n<p>Use as you please, share around, support and contact me if you want to chat about it.</p>\n<p>This project is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).</p>\n<p>Recreation by: Jardson Jean</p>\n<p>Lady Luck Soft - 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca538f9e3bf055e86d8c8c1570e1efa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LadyLuck"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
