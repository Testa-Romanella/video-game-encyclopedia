What once slept undisturbed in the lost temples of the Underworld is roused once more bringing forth the end of humankind&gt;&gt;</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Withering\u00a0</strong><strong>Light </strong>is a rules-light <strong>Lovecraftian </strong>fantasy <strong>horror </strong>RPG with <strong>OSR </strong>influences for a group of 4-5 people, one being the Game Master (GM). This game is heavily inspired by <strong>Lovecraftian's </strong><strong>mythos</strong>, Mothership (tuesday knight games), Blades in the Dark<strong>\u00a0</strong>(Evil Hat Productions) and\u00a0Darkest Dungeon<strong> </strong>(Red Hook's Roguelite).<br/></p>\n<p>In Withering Light, players take on the roles of adventurers delving deep into a haunted and dark underworld making their way through eldritch abominations and horrors that will consume their minds. The more the adventurers will delve deep into the earth, the more the lights will wither giving way to madness and despair.<br/></p>\n<p>To survive, adventurers must hold on to their weapons and torches and, most importantly, cooperate.<br/></p>\n<p>Artwork by <strong>Guil Inchausti (Reddit)<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Notes from the author (me!): </strong>this project is both a tribute to my favorite games/authors and an attempt to mix design principles usually associated with the OSR scene (e.g., dungeoncrawling, exploration, loot hoarding, player's agency) with psychological themes including the horror and insanity. Lastly, the RPGenesis2021 jam served as a training ground for my (modest) design skills forcing me to create something in a short amount of time. </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Withering Light as least half as much I enjoyed creating it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c52fdf64ece6e0d34f7a8979353d27ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zove161"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
