Not joking. Impossible to win. This game features 3 difficulties (easy, medium, and hard). In the first level, the player must pass through a cluster of bowling balls rolling down towards a giant ramp. The player must dodge all the balls to get to the finish line. The second level features a 2D level platforming design. The user must go across a sea of lava and then dodge moving obstacles to get to the next level. The third level is hardest level of all (look at thumbnail). Its basically using the\u00a0 concept as the 2D platformer but I made it in 3D.\u00a0\u00a0The user must go through all these moving obstacles to win the game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Controls: WASD<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e2da4177f39f6ea575339e35b599a1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeffreyliu321"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
