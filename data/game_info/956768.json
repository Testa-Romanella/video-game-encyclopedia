The universe was a swirling mass of energy and matter, without form or direction. But from this chaos, eight powerful beings emerged, each one representing an elemental force of nature.</p>\n<p>The first was <strong>Pyros</strong>, the god of Fire, whose fierce flames burned bright and hot, illuminating the darkness and bringing warmth and light to the universe.</p>\n<p>The second was <strong>Zephyr</strong>, the goddess of Air, whose gentle breezes whispered across the void, carrying with them the seeds of life and the promise of change.</p>\n<p>The third was <strong>Aquarius</strong>, the goddess of Water, whose cool, soothing embrace brought peace and tranquility to the chaos, calming the stormy seas of the universe.</p>\n<p>The fourth was <strong>Terra</strong>, the god of Earth, whose unyielding strength and stability provided a foundation for all things, from the smallest pebble to the mightiest mountain.</p>\n<p>The fifth was <strong>Vitalis</strong>, the goddess of Life, whose nurturing touch gave birth to all living things, filling the universe with a riot of color and sound.</p>\n<p>The sixth was <strong>Mortis</strong>, the god of Death, whose gentle release gave peace to those who had lived their lives and ensured that the universe would never become overcrowded.</p>\n<p>The seventh was <strong>Umbra</strong>, the goddess of Shadow, whose dark embrace concealed secrets and mysteries beyond human comprehension, while also providing a necessary balance to the other elements.</p>\n<p>And finally, there was <strong>Arcanum</strong>, the god of Magic, whose infinite knowledge and power gave rise to the very fabric of the universe and the laws that governed it.</p>\n<p>For eons, the elemental gods existed in a state of harmony, each one working in perfect balance with the others to maintain the universe. But over time, their personalities and agendas began to clash, and they began to war with each other, each one determined to gain dominance over the others.</p>\n\n\n<p>AGE OF CHAOS</p>\n<p>For centuries, the wars raged on, with no clear victor in sight. But eventually, a group of mortal champions emerged, gifted with powers drawn from each of the elements. These champions, known as the Ascendants, fought on behalf of their chosen god, hoping to tip the balance of power in their favor.</p>\n<p>The wars continue to this day, with the Ascendants fighting for their gods and the fate of the universe hanging in the balance. Despite the valiant efforts of the Ascendants, the wars between the elemental gods continued for centuries, with no end in sight. Entire worlds were torn apart by the constant clashes, and the mortals who lived under their watchful eyes suffered greatly.</p>\n<p>Finally, it was Arcanum who suggested a truce. With his vast knowledge of the universe, he was able to see the destructive path the wars were leading the gods and the mortals alike. He called upon his fellow elemental gods to lay down their weapons and come together in peace.</p>\n<p>At first, the other gods were hesitant. The wounds of the wars ran deep, and many were still nursing grudges against their rivals. But Arcanum was persistent, and he was able to convince the other gods that a truce was the only way forward. Together, the elemental gods crafted the Treaty of Balance, a document that would ensure peace and harmony in the universe. The treaty called for a council of the gods to be formed, with representatives from each of the elemental factions. It also established rules and regulations for how the gods could interact with mortals, ensuring that they would no longer be used as pawns in the wars between the gods.</p>\n\n\n<p>AGE OF BALANCE</p>\n<p>The Treaty of Balance was signed in a grand ceremony that was witnessed by mortals and immortals alike. It was a momentous occasion, one that marked the end of centuries of strife and conflict. In the aftermath of the treaty, the elemental gods began to work together in ways they never had before. They shared their knowledge and power, working to maintain the delicate balance of the universe. And though there were still disagreements and rivalries, they were resolved peacefully, without resorting to violence. For the mortals who lived under their watchful eyes, the Treaty of Balance brought a new era of peace and prosperity. They no longer had to live in fear of the wars between the gods, and they were able to focus on building their own societies and civilizations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so, the universe entered a new era of harmony, thanks to the wisdom and persistence of Arcanum and the elemental gods who signed the Treaty of Balance. For centuries, the Treaty of Balance held strong, and the universe flourished in peace and harmony. Mortals built great cities, explored new frontiers, and made incredible advancements in science and magic, all under the watchful eyes of the elemental gods.</p>\n<p>Mortis was trapped in the Shadow Realm, plotting her revenge against the other elemental gods. She knew that she needed to be patient and wait for the right opportunity to strike. During her time in the Shadow Realm, Mortis discovered a powerful spell that would allow her to create a portal to the mortal realm. She knew that if she could escape the Shadow Realm undetected, she could begin to work on her plan to take down the other gods. She spent years studying the spell and perfecting her technique, until she was finally ready to attempt her escape. She cast the spell and stepped through the portal, emerging in a remote part of the mortal world.</p>\n<p>Once in the mortal world, Mortis disguised herself as a mortal and began to work on her plan in secret. She knew that the other gods would be watching her every move, so she needed to be careful and avoid attracting too much attention. Mortis began to gather followers, using her charm and dark magic to sway mortals to her cause. She promised them power and immortality in exchange for their loyalty, and many mortals were swayed by her dark promises. As her following grew, Mortis began to sow seeds of discord among the other gods. She spread rumors and lies, turning the gods against each other and causing them to lose trust in one another.</p>\n<p>Finally, the time was right for Mortis to make her move. She launched a surprise attack on the other gods, catching them off guard and unleashing her full power. The battle was fierce, with all the gods unleashing their most powerful spells and attacks. Mortis fought with a ferocity that none of the other gods had ever seen before, and she seemed to be winning the battle. But just as victory seemed within her grasp, Mortis was suddenly overwhelmed by a powerful blast of magic. She fell to the ground, defeated and weakened. As she lay there, Mortis realized that she had been betrayed by one of her own followers. One of her most trusted lieutenants had been secretly working with the other gods, feeding them information and helping them to defeat Mortis. With Mortis defeated and weakened, the other gods were able to finally put an end to her plot for revenge. They banished her to the Shadow Realm once again, where she would spend eternity contemplating her failure and plotting her next move.</p>\n\n\n<p>AGE OF STRIFE</p>\n<p>Mortis, the elemental god of death and darkness, had been trapped in the Shadow Realm for centuries, plotting her revenge against the other elemental gods who had betrayed her and cast her into exile. Finally, she found a way to escape, and she emerged from the darkness with a burning desire for vengeance.</p>\n<p>Mortis immediately set about building an army of the undead, using her powers to raise the dead and bend them to her will. She also began to recruit other dark beings, such as necromancers and liches, to her cause, promising them power and influence in the mortal realms.</p>\n<p>With her army at her back, Mortis unleashed destruction upon the mortal realms. She and her minions rampaged across the land, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake. Mortals cowered in fear, and even the other elemental gods were hard-pressed to stop her.</p>\n<p>As the ages passed, Mortis continued her reign of terror. She seemed unstoppable, and her army of the undead grew stronger and more numerous with each passing day. Mortals lived in constant fear of her, and even the bravest heroes dared not challenge her.</p>\n<p>But Mortis's lust for power was insatiable. She began to turn on her own followers, destroying those who displeased her and absorbing their power into herself. Her thirst for destruction and dominance knew no bounds.</p>\n<p>For centuries, Mortis ruled over the mortal realms with an iron fist, her army of the undead spreading chaos and destruction wherever they went. But eventually, even her dark power began to wane. The other elemental gods slowly regained their strength, and mortals began to band together to fight back against her tyranny.</p>\n<p>Mortis, the elemental god of death and darkness, had been trapped in the Shadow Realm for centuries, plotting her revenge against the other elemental gods who had betrayed her and cast her into exile.

As Mortis and her army of the undead clashed against the forces of the other elemental gods and the mortals who opposed her, the very earth shook and split apart. The forces of magic and darkness unleashed by Mortis tore through the fabric of reality, rending a massive rift across the human empire that would never fully heal. The land was left scarred and changed forever, a reminder of the devastation wrought by Mortis and her quest for ultimate power.</p>\n<p>In the end, Mortis was defeated. Her army of the undead was destroyed, and she was cast back into the Shadow Realm once again. But even in defeat, she continued to plot and scheme, waiting for the day when she could once again rise to power and unleash her vengeance upon the mortal realms.</p>\n<p>In a world still reeling from the aftermath of Mortis' rampage, a group of brave adventurers seeks to make a difference. Driven by a deep desire to heal the land, the group sets out on a perilous journey, venturing across the mortal realms to find a way to restore balance and peace and claim the title of Ascendant. Little do they know, their quest will take a sinister turn when they discover Mortis' plans to strike again. With the fate of the realms in their hands, the group must use all their skills and courage to stop Mortis and her minions, and save their world from eternal darkness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T16:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af41b92dd623d969d0259b71a2f36d05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arkytoothis"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
