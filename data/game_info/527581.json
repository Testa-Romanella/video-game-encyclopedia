The jams theme is retro and so I did the most retro game I've think of and changed a bit. I've made Galaga and Space Invaders mix with \"Quick Time Event\" system. If you can press the right number on the right time your ship will fire. Also player and normal enemy can be killed with one shot only the boss have more hit points. This game is played with WASD keys and\u00a0 Numpad Numbars. (You need be make sure you lock your numpad numbers so you can use it for pressing numbers or it act like as a WASD keys.\u00a0)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eeb204c8de69bc1cf8ff0778a686084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kaljal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
