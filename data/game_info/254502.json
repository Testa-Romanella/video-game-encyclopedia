Street harassment happens everywhere. To some people, they have to face this situation everyday. Aggressive or sexual words are not compliment, they can bring negative influence to the victim. During the exploration in the virtual train carriage, pay attention to the words in red. They represent how most of outsiders think of victim in sexual harassment. Also, listen carefully when you bypass each passenger because the things they said are common in street harassment. By experiencing the feeling of being stared and harassed, I aim to make players rethink the seriousness of street harassment and what actions should be taken to stop it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f85bf35f1631c37b564aca4c78fd4e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DonnaLee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
