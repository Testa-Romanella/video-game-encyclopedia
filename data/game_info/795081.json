First time doing pixel art, making a 3d game and finishing a game jam. It was a lot of fun, took way more of my life than I expected,\u00a0\u00a0and I\u00a0learned a lot about Unreal Engine blueprints.\u00a0I'm leaving on a vacation and won't be able to do anymore work on it before the end of the jam but I did my best to deliver a final product despite cutting my scope way back. Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Charlie aka rubbery_shrubbery</p>\n<p>-----------credits----------</p>\n<p>Environmental textures from Jetsans Sci-Fi Texture pack (https://jestan.itch.io/sci-fi-textures)</p>\n<p>Ambient soundscape with drums by Erokia (https://freesound.org/people/Erokia/sounds/634546/)</p>\n<p>Dark Schippie Dues Battle Music: Super\u00a0Mega Ultimate Final Boss Battle by FoolBoyMedia (https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/530064/)</p>\n<p>hand sprite from pngkit .com</p>\n<p>Everything else is me!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T15:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55a/55a414749243429fa0baa5fbd4aa21d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charlie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
