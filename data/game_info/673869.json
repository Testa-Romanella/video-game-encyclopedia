With Swolemochao!", "description": "<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This game is not suitable for people who have hand problems like Carpel Tunnel and involves a lot of button mashing.</p>\n<p>You wanna get fit? You wanna get powerful? Well all you need is the help of the strongest mechanical Chao out there, Swolemochao! Using his intense work out regimen, you'll be swole and your muscles will be flexing (maybe literally)!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a single button game but also requires the mouse. So make sure your space key works and so does your mouse. You don't need a mouse during gameplay, just menus.</p>\n<p>The game was made in under 24 hours and was a joke game as a birthday gift for a friend of mine! I\u00a0decided to upload it somewhere just to say \"yeup, I\u00a0made more games.\" and just for some resume material. I\u00a0added a couple of enhancements to make the game a little more tolerable with basic settings added to it.</p>\n<p>This game is a non-profit fan game and features music and sound effects not made by me. Because of that, it should never be sold.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a9e16d170eb190ff8f84a4d7ecec84d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stolken"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
