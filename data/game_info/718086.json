We try to let the player feel all the emotions that soldiers live in the confusion and adrenaline of a battlefield. Explosions, devastation, orders, shot fires will be all around the player, that will be rewarded by the game not for his number of kills, but for his strategic and survival skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Large battles and historical locations</strong><br/>All campaign will take place in <strong>large Open-World maps</strong> that reproduces the real places of the fights, and battles plans are faithful to the events that have historically occurred. <br/><br/>Participates in the landing of Anzio in January, 1944, and brings the front from the Italian coasts to the city of Cassino.<br/><br/><br/>Revisit the war in the Pacific and the conquest of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands<br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Squad based gameplay</strong><br/>No one can go to war alone; A good tactic require a good team work.<br/>So be the <strong>squad leader</strong>, or the <strong>medic</strong>, or maybe the <strong>radioman</strong>: You will always have a job to do inside your squad.<br/><br/>We especially focused on creating <strong>sub-objectives</strong> that differs from main mission objectives. While the main objective of a team may be to have to conquer a specific area, a sub-objective could be assigned following the radio requests of a tank to clear its way from an anti-tank gun that has been sighted. So gameplay has radically improved in a more realistic and dynamic way. <br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Vehicles</strong><br/>War machines have changed the war forever, and World War 2 proved that in an unequivocal way, so Prepare to jump in you Panzer 4, Sherman, M3 lee, or any tank that dominated the real battles fought in the game.<br/>We decided to let the player have a full control of the crew of the vehicles; He will be able to drive and shoot tanks, as long as there are crew members on the seats to use each armament. Also battles don't stop when a tank is disabled. Lot of tank crews in World War 2 had time to escape from unusable tanks and survive the battles, and so it will in Easy Red 2: If you lost your tank in a fight you will need to bring your crew back to your lines safely.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/>Play online in PvP and PvE missions coming from the game or the Mission Editor.<br/>Play with your own squad or join squad of your friends.<br/>Create a match whenever you want and in any map you want.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Map &amp; Mission Editor</strong><br/>With the Map Editor is possible to create custom maps, using brush tools to raise/lower the terrain, paint the textures, add grass and props.<br/><br/>The Mission Editor allows anyone to create new missions for the game using game maps or maps made with the Map Editor.<br/>Both maps and missions can be shared &amp; downloaded from Steam Workshop<br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Devastation</strong><br/>Explosions, will destroy sandbags, walls, fences, vehicles, defenses, and the battlefield could radically change during all the fight.<br/>Also, enemy fire will constantly suppress you and your squad. Learn how to move safely in a real combat scenario, and keep your helmet on your head.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Optimizations</strong><br/>We want a smooth war simulation, so we designed our own graphic style to bring great animations, textures and effects, with the compromise of having a high and stable Frame-Rate.
