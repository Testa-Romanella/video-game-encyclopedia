This is best played with a game controller and a few friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>\n<p>If you press \"Join Game\" and nothing happens it's because your computer is missing the libraries needed for multiplyer/networking to work. Look in the folder for VC_redist.x86.exe (32 bit windows) or VC_redist.x64.exe (64 bit windows) and click to install depending on your OS. Alternatively you can find those same files here https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ in the section \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019\". Once you've installed try running the game again and you should be able to join!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Jo Adams</strong> - Gameplay &amp; Networking (@duplicatedframe)</li><li><strong>Raphael Azcueta</strong> - Gameplay &amp; Art (@LUNARSIGNALS)</li><li><strong>Anthony Tesija</strong> - Networking &amp; Art (@AntonTesh)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>bu\u00b7oy</strong> /\u02c8bo\u035eo\u0113,boi/\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>noun</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0an anchored float serving as a navigation mark, to show reefs or other hazards, or for mooring.\r\n</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:58:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c17f51a1de42b330f2664fe68f041d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Tesija", "lunarsignals", "jo adams"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
