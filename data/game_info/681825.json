This genre mix has potential we believe could result in unique, fun, and intuitive gameplay.</p>\n<p>The <em>Tower Defense</em> genre brings wave-based combat in combination with a high ceiling of creativity to defend your base. While <em>Roguelikes</em> come with an aspect of exploration, and discovery of items. We want to bring these together to create a game where each time you play, you will have to be creative and adapt to reach the goal.\r\n</p>\n<p>We are now experimenting with a central base and having waves varying in their spawn positions. With constant variation in wave direction, we found that there\u2019s almost a necessity to have relocatable turrets. It\u2019s an interesting twist on the classical Tower Defense games that we have grown fond of. Our hope is that it will feel unique and open up for more skill expression and new types of interesting choices.\r\n</p>\n<p>We want to make a 3D game and thematically, we have started exploring the idea of having turtles with turrets which you can move during the planning phase before becoming stationary.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our core design values:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Strategic depth\r\n</li><li>Uniqueness in turrets and units\r\n</li><li>High density of interesting choices</li></ul>\n<p>You can share feedback to us on our survey here.</p>\n<p>We hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>- Walking Home Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11bb3cd4ae6474c8e6c82fc995468b43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WalkingHomeStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
