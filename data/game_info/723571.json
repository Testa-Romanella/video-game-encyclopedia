It is not a full game, just the story of how you obtain your ability and an introduction to using it.</p><p>To add to the originality of your character and their power, I included a short origin story.\u00a0You can play the <strong>full demo</strong> (how you get your ability + using it to solve a puzzle), or just <strong>jump to the puzzle portion</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: </strong>These\u00a0are given in-game, but here are some points to remember:</p>\n<ul><li>After unlocking your power, use\u00a0Space to interact with objects</li><li>When you use your power, you lose held items</li></ul>\n<p>This game uses the keyboard and mouse. If the keyboard does not work, you may need to click inside the game window first. In rare cases you may need to refresh the page.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>STORY SPOILER:</strong> The unique ability is transforming the game world back and forth from 2D to 3D. You obtain this ability once you make the deal with the snake in the 2D world.\u00a0The original character (you!) is a human stuck inside a virtual world where you must save your poisoned friend by helping a manipulative snake save his own friend.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS: </strong>Textures are public domain (CC0) from opengameart.org and sound effects from\u00a0mixkit.co.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5a03393293e53daee6f3f8b09befb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JJ & Friends!"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
