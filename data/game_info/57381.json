It is a video game adaptation of the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). The game was developed by Factor 5 and published by JVC Musical Industries, Inc. The story is told through cutscenes and text and is mostly faithful to the movies. Its release coincided with that of Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, also released by JVC and LucasArts and in the same platform style as the Super Star Wars trilogy.<br />\nA Sega Mega Drive/Genesis port of the game was apparently completed and ready to be released between summer and autumn of 1995, and was reviewed in GamePro (issue 83, August 1995, graphics rated 4.0 out of 5.0, sound and funfactor rated 3.5 out of 5.0, control rated 4.5 out of 5.0) and in Germany&#39;s GAMERS (November 1995 issue, rated 2, or B Grade). Like many third-party titles near the end of the Genesis&#39; life, however, the game was shelved and was never released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-11T13:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57a/57a0d33f128e618d0ecc326dac00e3f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 14, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Factor 5"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "JVC"], "esrb_rating": null}
