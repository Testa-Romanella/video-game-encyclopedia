Each number represents a sequence of consecutive marked cells.

There might also be some empty cells before and after these sequences.\r\n    The hard part is figuring out where exactly these sequences fit. You  do this by making deductions and finding the places where there <em>must </em>(or<em> mustn't) </em>be marked cells based on the way hints in the rows and columns intersect. The wikipedia entry for nonograms has a lot of strategies.</p>\n<p>Source code on GitHub.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T11:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d1b8860ceaee835ff202b2c67587f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
