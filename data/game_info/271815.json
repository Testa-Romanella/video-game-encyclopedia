Depending on which state you\u2019re in, depends on how you move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had some more ideas, and ran into a few issues, for this game but could only implement/fix some in the time that we had. If you play, and enjoy our game, please leave us a comment and let us know! We\u2019d love to continue development if people enjoy it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: It\u2019s much, much easier to play with a controller! Keyboard controls are extremely hard!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c3989ac7c34e2af05282359eaa47e5b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ABAlmeida"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
