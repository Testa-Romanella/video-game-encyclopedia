Don\u2019t make the road too steep or your car will flip and crash!<br/><br/>On your endless highway trip, there will be other dangers to look out for. Pillars get faster and faster, and go higher and higher. Don\u2019t forget to build that road, otherwise you\u2019ll crash down.<br/><br/>For the expert bridge constructors, you can try to build your track to collect the coins floating in the air. If you build correctly, you will get the coins. But avoid the bombs if you don\u2019t want to go boom!<br/><br/>By downloading the game you accept our End User License Agreement, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy: http://support.vividgames.com/policies<br/>Contact us anytime at support@vividgames.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T22:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c77/c77f784122bd3cd73a177b036efa82de.jpg", "website": "https://vividgames.com/games/?lang=en", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Vivid Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Vivid Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
