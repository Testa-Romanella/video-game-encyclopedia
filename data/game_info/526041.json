Each piece is a statement within a larger conversation, isolating an aspect of the dialogue, examining it, and placing it within the context of other work in the space. As a medium based in creation of the multiple, print becomes a method for creating structure. This framework, indulging a desire for order, creates space for disruptions. Using prints as modular components allows the work to inherit visual information across pieces. I am interested in how this repetition of imagery and motif reflects recurring thought patterns.\u00a0\r\nThe virtual exhibition has been a fascinating experience, giving me the chance to think about my work without some of the constraints of a physical space. I was able to suspend and animate movement into portions of the exhibition in new, exciting ways. I explored repetition and layering of pattern elements and played with the scale of various aspects, while at the same time trying to make a space you could believably walk into. I look forward to taking my discoveries into future physical installations. I am deeply grateful to Clayton Harper and Chelsea Brtis\u00a0for helping me to navigate this new platform, and SECAC for the support of my work through the Artist\u2019s Fellowship and the opportunity to share my work with you all. \r\nAbout the Artist:\r\nAdrian Rhodes grew up in Hartsville, South Carolina.

For the best possible in-browser experience we recommend Firefox, but it is also compatible with Chrome, Safari and Edge. (It is not, unfortunately, currently iOS or Android compatible.) Depending on your connection, it may take a moment to load. Once it\u2019s open, if you experience anything funky (lagging play, etc.) try closing other open tabs which may be using up the browsers processing power. If you\u2019re still getting less than optimal play, try refreshing the virtual exhibition tab and then closing other applications which may be running on your computer in the background.\u00a0\r\nCursor and Keyboard Commands:\r\n\u2013 After launching, LEFT-CLICK inside the viewport to activate navigation.\r\n\u2013 Use your CURSOR to control the viewing angle by holding LEFT-CLICK in the viewport and dragging the cursor in the direction you\u2019d like the camera to move (i.e. click and move the cursor left to pan the camera left, etc.)\r\n\u2013 Use your ARROW KEYS or WASD to control player movement. Left and right (A and D) will move you sideways without changing the camera angle.\u00a0\r\n\u2013 When facing an artwork, RIGHT-CLICK to zoom in for a closer view. Right-click again to zoom back out.\u00a0\r\n\u2013 When prompted, press \u201cE\u201d to open documents and linked files in another browser tab.\u00a0\r\n\u2013 To end your session simply close the tab.\r\nNavigation Description:\u00a0\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever played \u2018first-person\u2019 video games in the past, the navigation should be familiar and fairly intuitive. If you haven\u2019t, just imagine that the camera angle represents your perspective as though you were standing in the gallery. Player movement is controlled through a combination of cursor and keyboard arrow keys, with your cursor controlling the angle of view and arrow keys (or WASD) controlling movement relative to your angle of view: forward, sideways, backward, etc. Hopefully you\u2019ll get the hang of it pretty quickly! And you can review the cursor and keyboard commands above for a more detailed description of the navigation.\u00a0\r\nAs you move through the virtual environment you can activate hyperlinks by moving closely to linked objects, including artworks, within the virtual environment. When you're near a linked object a message will pop up telling you which button to push and what will happen when you do. (i.e. \u201cPress E to open exhibition checklist\u201d.) Pressing the button on your keyboard will open the linked content in a new tab in your browser. To close new content simply close its tab.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e7c0d9c5af1c93f6c44505e1d025152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Virtual Anderson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
