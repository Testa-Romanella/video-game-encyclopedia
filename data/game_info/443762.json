I can't for the life of me figure out how to fix it, so if you've got any ideas please let me know!</p>\n<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with how this game has turned out so far and am planning to continue working on it for a bit longer and look into releasing it for Android and iOS :)</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/jazz-comedy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/1697d7888566785ef1dd8ba83e932116.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Scott Topping"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
