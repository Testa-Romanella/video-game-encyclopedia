Whether you\u2019re a beginner (yes, I\u2019m talking about you) or a pro (hmm, debatable), the variety of game modes will challenge you with its witty AI. Play solo, or play against a friend (or against yourself if you don\u2019t have any)\u2026 or even let an AI play against another AI. Go grab some popcorn.<br/><br/>It is as beautiful as it is witty, and minimalistic as it is fun. A scrollable history view captures your previous moves, and the wonderful haptics keep you engaged.<br/><br/>This is chess like you\u2019ve always known it, but better, way better. I hope you enjoy Chessmate as much as I did making it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a868c7ea83f8b320fc58cc0325c5d7c.jpg", "website": "http://thebluebird.app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Shihab Mehboob"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Shihab Mehboob"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
