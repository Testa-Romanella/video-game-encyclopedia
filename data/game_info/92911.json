It invites the viewer/player to dive into a surreal atmosphere, sharing the character's experience.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt is not about horror. It is more about a dream. People may experience different feelings in a dream. Any regular action may cause surrealistic consequences. The game provides a player a combination of expressions (if he/she wants to get it).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game takes about 10-20 minutes to play. There is only one location and various stuff to interact with.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe soundtrack of the game has written by Shawn Claude Jones. The composer sought to reference the original source material which Bunuel chose for the original screening.\r\n</p><p> <br/></p><p>\r\n\tAdditional links:<br/>\r\n\t \u2022 The game's site <br/>\r\n\t \u2022 Presskit <br/>\r\n\t \u2022 Twitter @nothanksgames<br/>\r\n\t \u2022 Authors Ilya Kononenko and Yuliya Kozhemyako <br/>\r\n\t \u2022 Composer Shawn Claude Jones\r\n</p><p>Please note: the atmosphere of the game depends on the graphical settings.<br/></p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50ffd58407fb7afdab117f04f03e9f7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["no, thanks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
