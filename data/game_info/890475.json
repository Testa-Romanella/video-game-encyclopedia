Follow your heart!</p>\n<p>There are a few assets that aren't used for anything. The old man by the lake is just dialogue. The spider silk isn't currently used for anything. There is a teleporter that is inactive. The gravestone is just flavor text. I\u00a0may eventually add more to this project, but as of right now, I have lost my inspiration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I titled this game \"Inspired\" because a friend of mine started making a game of his own in RPGMaker XP, and it inspired me to mess around with RPGMaker MV. I will link to it when he uploads it!</p>\n<p>Features 6 different enemies with unique movesets, 15 different screens (some are lackluster), spells, items, and (I believe) balanced short-term progression!</p>\n<p>I recommend using the arrow keys and enter keys to navigate throughout the game, rather than using the mouse.</p>\n<p>I'm open to any and all feedback! Just keep in mind it's my first time, so please be gentle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482dbb7bf516546624092ac80ba10893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swagdaddy31"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
