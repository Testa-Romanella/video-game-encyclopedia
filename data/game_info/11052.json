The game is set in the world of pre-Roman age and includes 3 locations: Ancient Greece, Egypt, and eastern civilizations. The story begins with a narration about Titans, who ruled the entire world before the Olympians. The idea is that a trio of Telkines managed to break off the communication between Earth and Olympus and started terrorizing the mortal world. The protagonist is a hero, who is expected to defeat Telkines and to restore the conduit linking to worlds. To assume the role of the mythical hero players need to customize their own character: choose the gender and appearance. The further action continues in a traditional hack and slash manner. Players navigate the 3D world through the overhead third-person view and lead the protagonist with the mouse, while special abilities are tied to keyboard buttons. The Anniversary edition includes all possible fixtures and improvements of graphics and gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:13:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/33d/33df5a032898b8ab7e3773c7a5f1d336.jpg", "website": "https://www.thqnordic.com/games/titan-quest-anniversary-edition", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 409, "owned": 6354, "beaten": 342, "toplay": 59, "dropped": 333, "playing": 40}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 109, "ratings_count": 759, "suggestions_count": 511, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 766, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Iron Lore Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": null}
