{"id": 869515, "slug": "akashic-code", "name": "Akashic Code", "name_original": "Akashic Code", "description": "<strong>Description</strong>\n<p>Akashic Code is (a very early prototype of) a game set in a space opera universe where you (will) control a female sniper sometimes followed by the ghost of a fallen soldier. Her goal is to complete missions/contracts given by a mysterious employer.</p>\r\nHow did I came up with this ? (In case you're wondering...)\r\n<p>I started by generating ideas with an online website to give me the following data :</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>Genre </em></strong>: Survival x Rythm</li><li><strong><em>Rule </em></strong>: 1 HP</li><li><strong><em>Setting </em></strong>: Space Opera</li><li><strong><em>Theme </em></strong>: Rich vs. Poor</li></ul>\n<p>That gave me a simple base to expand upon. Just for fun I then looked up for a Text Generator AI to get a storyline for the game and by picking the best part I got an interesting synopsis.</p>\n<p>To complete the idea, I then generated a name for the game.</p>\n<p>For the visual style of this prototype I followed Leon Stansfield's \"How to make 3D Pixel Art in Godot!\"\u00a0(and also his grass rendering video) using a palette by\u00a0Joao Vasconcelos on Lospec.</p>\n<strong>\"What can I do in this prototype ?\"</strong>\n<p>I will update this section of the game page if I ever continue this project.</p>\n<p>As of now, you can move your character in a simple debug scene with some trees, grass and water. There is no real gameplay for the moment being.</p>\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n<p>Thanks for everyone who made the tools/websites that helped me build this game idea. Thanks to randy\u00a0for giving me the will to\u00a0upload this unfinished project.</p>\n<p>If you're interested, feel free to share ideas for the project, or ask me for collaboration.\u00a0If this game is\u00a0abandoned and you want to continue it, feel free to ask me too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T15:55:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/5960039dd13d18be8a264425f22a432b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luckius"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
