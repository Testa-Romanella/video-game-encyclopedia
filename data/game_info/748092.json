This increases every time you make a sale. Each item has a different value so don't waste your time on cheap, easy to grab items.<br/><br/>Team Roles:<br/>Brandon (Myself) - Team Manager &amp; Gameplay Programmer<br/>Andrew - AI Programmer<br/>Taylor - Asset Modeller<br/>Hayden - Asset Modeller<br/><br/>All members worked on concept and sharing of ideas.<br/><br/>This was a college project in February of 2020, only worked on for a few hours each day for 4 days during the college schedule.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:59:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6dbad92fb369c12f6f4b84b9c7925b6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrandonN"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
