As it is my <em>first </em>serious attempt at making a game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Left click to dash, A/D or arrow keys to spin</p>\r\nMore Info\r\n<p>In this <em>extremely </em>short top-down game\u00a0you play as an abstract triangle who can dash in any direction and bounce off \"walls\". Your goal is to collect all red shards in the level without hitting any spikes. Failing to do so, or depleting the dash count, will result in a loss.</p>\n<p>Only six (terrible and poorly designed) levels were made because I had reached the deadline I set for myself, so I was \"forced\" to wrap the game up and call it finished. I might, based on reviews, continue developing it and adding levels and new mechanics in the future; though unlikely and no promises are made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b3198f831e80f7288a3ca6909f2df0cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Pyrodynamic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
