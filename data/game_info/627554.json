HIRT is a <strong>sheep-fueled local multiplayer brawler game with intense, emergent gameplay</strong>. HIRT puts the players in the role of competing shepherds. They try to win holy pastures for their antagonized clans, fighting each other with every mean they find on the sheep inhabited islands.<h3> A unique systemic brawler gameplay</h3>HIRT follows a systemic gameplay approach. This means that the game world is cohesive and built on simple rules and systems. Those lead to a huge amount of possible outcomes and chain reactions. <strong>Pushing a dog off an altar with a tornado horn and awakening a stampede? Sure. Sheering wool off your dead Co-Player? Yep. Getting thrown off the island while hooked to a staff? Here you go.</strong><br/><br/><h3>HIRT offers:</h3><ul><li>2-4 Players in Local Multiplayer Couch Fighting Splitscreen</li><li>A emergent gameplay and world, where weird chain reactions with sheep and weaponry are possible</li><li>A strange and outstanding setting, in which player fight with herds of self-determined animals<br/><br/><h3>A multitude of islands to brawl on</h3>HIRT combines epic sceneries with intense and hectic gameplay mechanics. Players face each other over and over again on a multitude of islands, desperately trying to win back the old remnants and forgotten sanctuaries for their clan. However, the sheep inhabited maps differ in size, available space and layout. Additionally, each map has a HIRT-unique system of item and sheep randomizing, which creates new elements of surprise and mayhem with every round the shepherds fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Join our community on discord: https://discord.gg/H4bF2yk</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T02:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/31881e5bc8c5af51ebc6c25d7c07b392.jpg", "website": "https://playhirt.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Togglesword Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Togglesword Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
