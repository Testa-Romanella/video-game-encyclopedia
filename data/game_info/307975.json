Through a strenuous boss gauntlet,\u00a0players attempt to repair their Grandma\u2019s virus infected computer. Can you overcome the obstacles impeding your grandma's ability to send e-cards? Faced\u00a0with\u00a0a stream of standalone levels to play, you'll come to know the vulnerabilities that bosses exploit.</p>\n<p>If you think you're a good grand-kid capable of helping your Grandma, see if your computer science knowledge is up to snuff in\u00a0<em>Byte-Sized Boss Beatdown</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you are a professional in an educational practice, you'll find this game useful in a teaching context. Games are often falsely thought of as solely recreational. More and more, we are seeing a paradigm shift in the games industry to present entertainment in an educational manner. James Paul Gee's writings in\u00a0<em>What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</em>, published in 2003 delves into\u00a0situated meaning and cognition. This is to say that using the jargon that developers or systems use are not necessarily conducive to mimicking or creating a desired understanding in players. Through gameplay, <em>Byte-Sized Boss Beatdown</em> teaches computer science elements and necessary steps to protect one's personal computer from viruses in a context where it makes sense in an introductory way.</p>\n<p>Don't believe us? Take a look at\u00a0<em>Dumb Ways\u00a0</em><em>to Die</em>, the world's most popular public service announcement. Metro Trains Melbourne launched the campaign to promote rail safety, with release of the first\u00a0game within a year,\u00a0after the video went viral. It is by looking to these examples that we are inspired to build out games in aims to\u00a0achieve learning objectives.</p>\n<p>As a result, by the end of\u00a0<em>Byte Size Boss Beatdown,</em>\u00a0players are be able to:</p>\n<ul><li>Recognize computer threat classifications that can afflict\u00a0computers</li><li>Identify how viruses, malware and neglect to maintain system checks negatively impacts their computer</li><li>Distinguish appropriate methods in removing these computer threats and repair file systems afterward through computer system access</li><li>Recall how in-game activities and solutions are paralleled to real world benefit</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game was developed in the span of 6 months by a group of five fourth year undergraduate Game Design and Development students at\u00a0Wilfrid Laurier University\u00a0in collaboration with\u00a0MediaSmarts\u00a0for our Capstone project.
