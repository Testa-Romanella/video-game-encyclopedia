This game is an infinite runner based on the portal games! Your objective is to see how far you can survive, but be careful as the game gets harder as you play.\u00a0 In case you aren't familiar with Portal's mechanics, you are required to shoot two different colored Portals in order to play the game. The blue portal takes you to the yellow one, and the yellow portal takes you to the blue one. You'll get the hang of it after a few tries. Be careful though, only the light-grey surfaces are able to have a Portal placed on them, so make sure only to aim for those surfaces.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p><em>W/A/S/D</em> or the <em>Arrow Keys</em> to move the character</p><p><em>Space </em>to <em>Jump</em></p><p><em>Aim </em>with your <em>cursor</em></p><p><em>Left-Click</em> to shoot a blue Portal</p><p><em>Right-Click</em> to shoot a <em>yellow </em>Portal</p><p><strong>Questions to the player:</strong></p><p>What else can be implemented to make the game more fun and replayable?</p><p>Are the Portals working as intended?</p><p>Are you confused at all by the concepts presented?
