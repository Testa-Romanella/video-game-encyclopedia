Prioritising key clients, juggling priorities and just trying to keep your head above water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>\n<p>- drag boxes into slightly larger boxes</p><p>- panic as workloads become too much</p><p>- try to stay in control as much as possible<br/></p>\n\n<p>I'm a one-man team - all code is done by me\u00a0but music and imagery has been taken from various sources; attributions in the supplied txt file.<br/></p>\n<p>I'd really appreciate any feedback, positive or negative. The game isn't necessarily designed to be 'fun', I had more of an eye on the theme which pushed me away from something that was enjoyable - but\u00a0I hope you get 'something' from it.</p>\n<p>Sorry about the bugs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df209a0d90af5ea2f0c6aee053d537d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beztom"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
