Themes of communism, trans and lesbian experience.</p>\n<p>t\u2019s\u2026 a game only in the most tenuous sense: there is only one route. It's a short story presesnted in a fancy way. I hope I can get away with that. Perhaps in a later update I will add other routes through the story!</p>\n<p><strong>Content note:</strong> \r\ncontains explicit house/human/human/house sex scene, some other sexual \r\ncontent, mentions of transmisogyny, death, slavery and eugenics.</p>\n<p>Despite this it\u2019s actually extremely utopian! Embarassingly FALC-y in fact.\r\n</p>\n<p>I\r\n really hope you all enjoy this - I find writing about sex and sex \r\nscenes very nerve-wracking and it probably shows. Comments and gently \r\nexpressed criticism would be very much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Twee2 source available here.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80df4f1e65c4d6b45b104e96e8609882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["canmom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
