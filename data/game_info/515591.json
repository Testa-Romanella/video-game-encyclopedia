It is at the moment heavenly based on Call of Duty World at War zombies. But I'm soon adding original mechanics and ideas to the game. I'm at the moment working alone at this project which explains the textures of some things xD. I always searched for a cool simple CO-OP shooter game but never got to find one. So, logical next step, I'm making one! Since this is my first real project all the feedback and help is welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f667943713eb539887e46c1604a3c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rubiegames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
