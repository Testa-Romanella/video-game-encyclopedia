I love making music, so I decided to make my songs into a game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to move your mouse cursor towards the evil, taunting enemy dots! They can be different colours, in e.g.\u00a0 red, blue, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you miss one of the enemy dots, they will hit the cyan section of your player, and you lose! You have to let them pass through the dark red part of your player.</p>\n<p>You don't need to click any mouse button, this is a none clicker music rhythm game! You just move your mouse left or right to aim your player.</p>\n<p>(<strong>THIS IS ONLY A DEMO OF THE GAME, THE FULL GAME MIGHT HAVE SOME GRAPHICAL AND GAME CHANGES!</strong>)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T13:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc45b483f9d0d57adb2c511d3964d6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ioquack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
