I used one downloaded asset, the\u00a0Speech &amp; Thought Bubble System by Gannon Game Design - very cute &amp; useful system I highly recommend.</p>\n<p>In this game, based on the prompt \"YOU'RE THE BEST!\", you play as a weird little monkey guy, Stan, who wants to see his favorite choice win in the talent show. To that end, he not only has to protect and root for his fav, but sabotage the competition!</p>\n<p>Move left and right using 'A' and 'D', jump with 'Space' to block/grab tomatoes (it's a tough crowd in this theater...), and once you've caught some, use 'E' to throw them at pivotal times in the performance to tank the contestants rating with the judges. 'R' does a cheer/boo animation depending on whether your fav is up or not, and will raise or lower judge sympathy accordingly. Contestants acquire sympathy when they get hit with tomatoes outside of their talent animations, because attacking performers before they've even gotten a chance to get started is just mean. &gt;:O Higher sympathy results in bigger score gains when the crowd cheers.<br/></p>\n<p>Crowd cheering/booing/tomato throwing is handled pretty randomly...SOME GAMES it's a tomato onslaught, sometimes they're a bit scarce. It's technically possible for no tomatoes to ever be thrown! That would be pretty problematic. &lt;_&lt; But, if you want to be a Stan of the greatest integrity, it IS possible to play through the game without interfering with the show! You'll probably lose, though...probably.</p>\n<p>ALSO, I didn't put anything in to handle ties. There are three rounds; at the end of rounds 1 and 2, the contestant with the lowest score is removed from the game. If that's your fav, you lose. And if your fav is tied for lowest with someone else... it's random whether your fav or who they're tied with will be removed... same for the highest score winner decision on round 3. So I'ma just need you all to get very different scores for everyone, alright thanks</p>\n<p>HERE'S\u00a0THE CREATOR CREDITS for the music we used:</p>\n<p>Lobo Loco's Website: https://www.musikbrause.de<br/>Zaire's Userpage: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/ZAIRE<br/>Monplaisir's Website: https://loyaltyfreakmusic.com/<br/>Monk Turner's Website: http://monkturner.weebly.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T06:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d57f921c01af46cfbb7602520503646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["utzsar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
