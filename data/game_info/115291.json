I then submitted the game to EGX Rezzed's Leftfield Collection, so I went back and finished it off, and made it look a LOT nicer. You can download the show build below, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eebe2838456ec992807cf3a66e38698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giraffe Cat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
