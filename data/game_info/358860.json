Now go collect the stars and reach the goal.</p>\n<p>Based on an idea I had for an endless climber aimed at handheld devices. The art theme I then had in mind were a lot different, but because of time limitations I chose to go with something more simplistic. The art is inspired by Thomas was alone.</p>\n<p>Originally I wanted an endless level, but I was unsure of how to procedurally create a level that would both become harder and still be doable the higher you would reach. Thus I made short levels instead and added a total of 16 levels. Also, the original idea was supposed to be called Bean Up which would be about a delinquent bean who needed to climb up in order to mature and avoid coffee grinders and stuff.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15d3515b26cd907dc286c5550d4b8287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FreakyFeet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
