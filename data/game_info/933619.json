In Root &amp; Bloom, you can water tree roots to create defensive towers. A grid can have up to four tree roots, and tower strength increases as there are more roots on a grid.</p>\n<p>Watering the grass to make flowers bloom is also possible. The watering system is built on collecting water from the lake, and then commanding the cloud that is on the map to make rain.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p><em>Here is the list of essential controls.</em></p>\n<p>Left Click: <em>Navigation, Collecting Water, Watering, Planting<br/></em></p>\n<p>Right Click: <em>Cloud Movement<br/></em></p>\n<p>Mute Music/Sound: <em>M/V</em></p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n<p>Ata Deniz Oktay - Game Design &amp; Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Sezgi Sevilmi\u015f - Pixel Art<br/></p>\n<p>Yusuf K\u0131z\u0131lkaya - Music<br/></p>\n<p>G\u00f6rkem Y\u0131lmaz - Sound Design<br/></p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Mounir Tohami - Font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T11:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8ded23f0dcf61b5ebe358fc0a89c7d03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kizilejderha", "Beez", "sezg", "gorkeem01"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
