Here, the rules of chess are twisted into a new form. Move a piece next to adjacent allies and it becomes stronger, entering a combo state where it can infinitely chain moves with the right setup. There is no checkmate here, the only way to win is by physically taking the enemy's king piece.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the void.</p>\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<ol><li>Chess pieces can move to any space marked blue, take pieces marked red, and can perform special movements on spaces marked green (such as castling)</li><li>\u00a0Piece movement patterns work exactly as they do in regular chess, with the exception of En Passant, which is not implemented.</li><li>If you move a piece next to an adjacent ally, it will enter a \"combo\" state, allowing it to move again, or you can optionally use the \"End Combo\" button to leave the piece where it is. If you move the piece next to another piece again, it will remain in its combo state.</li><li>Win the game by capturing the enemy's king piece.</li></ol>\n\n<p>Made for the Brackeys 2021 Game Jam, with the theme \"Stronger Together\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e39/e394b3951872b986dfa36f78776225a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pefeper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
