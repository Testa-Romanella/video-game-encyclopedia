Things can only get better. Like hey, at least I finished making something. That honestly feels pretty good.<br/><br/>So this game's\u00a0got a one-player mode (A and D)\u00a0and a two-player mode (A and D and also left and right arrow keys), and the menu is W, S, and Space. Only the active girls can hit the ball.\u00a0Periodically the active girls will switch. First side to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it, have a great day. <br/>PDB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca70d6bce87ff2040ea54d46fd77018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PDB"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
