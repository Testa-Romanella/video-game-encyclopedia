Forever.<br/><br/><strong>String Tyrant</strong> is a survival horror game where you must look, think, hide, and if necessary, fight your way out of a mysterious mansion filled with monsters and traps.<br/><br/>If you're defeated by a monster or fall for a trap, you'll be ensnared by the manor's residents - and join them to hunt your former friends. At least you'll be a pretty doll.<br/><br/>The game has an <strong>active card-based combat system </strong>where you build combos using your magical cards. You can hear nearby enemies through doors and walls, can open and close doors to try to break line-of-sight, and must contend with traps that will tax your wits. You'll need to unlock the secrets of the manor to stand a real chance of escape.<br/><br/><strong>A free demo is provided</strong>. Please ensure system compatibility with the demo before purchasing the full game.<br/>The demo covers the first \"phase\" of the game, featuring one enemy types, three doll types, and two endings.
