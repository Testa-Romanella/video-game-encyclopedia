The uncertainty of the obstacles the players might go through next is what makes this experience unique. The players will never know if they will be able to survive the hurdles and challenges their dreams make them go through. It might be as simple as filling up a cup of water or as obscure and complex as fighting death itself. However, do not be fooled by what you may encounter, after all, it is just a dream, and you never know what may happen. </p><p><strong>Our Refection About This Game:</strong></p>\n<p>We decided to base our game <em>DREAMBLAZE</em> on the system of <em>Wretched and Alone</em> as it seemed to carry multiple ideas that we wanted to explore, such as being a single-player game with a more personal experience and focusing on storytelling along with role-playing rather than combat.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The mechanics we adapted from <em>Wretched and Alone</em> were also very useful.\u00a0 Some of the mechanics would be the use of the die and how the game document is very simply structured. Our goal was to create a game that can suit whoever is playing, and adapt to whatever mood and/or setting the GMs would like. In <em>DREAMBLAZE</em>, narrative plays a very distinguished role since it is required for any action to be completed. We designed our game to allow the players to be as creative as possible at creating scenarios, giving them the freedom of coming up with their most creative ideas and enjoying the game as much as possible.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>After playtesting our game, we decided to add a new optional rule \u201cif the player dies as a consequence of their actions during the completion of the challenge, they lose automatically\u201d. (The document is already updated with this rule included)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/7417fadb87702a1724a607cbf7a82355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luciane66"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
