The beginnings of this project was the prompt \"Goo\" and from there, it grew to,\u00a0uh, \"Slime\".</p>\n<p>It's a pretty normal platformer, but quite hard I'd say even with how brief it is! The big thing that might set it apart somehow is that the platforms are made of slime, and so you don't need to jump on them - you can just jump into them. Careful though, you'll slowly slide out of them!\u00a0</p><p>It has neat little backgrounds too, if you like those, but you'll need to find the SUPER SECRET CHEAT CODES to see them.<br/></p>\n<p>The current version being released right now is the gamejam version, however I will likely polish this up more in the coming months for fun, adding more levels and\u00a0backgrounds!</p>\n<p>Use the cheat-code \"SUN\" to unlock a secret background shader!</p>\n<p>Use the cheat-code \"CENTERSUN\" to unlock another secret background shader!</p>\n<p>Use the cheat-code \"BASIC\" to go back to the bland, black background shader!</p>\n<p>More cheat-codes may be revealed with time! I keep them in my SUPER SECRET CHEAT CODES text file on my computer that no one else is allowed to see and would be impossible for you to find anywhere on this page!</p>\n<p>Check out more about this game, and our main game \"Edge of Akestor\" on my Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/AkestorDev!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my wonderful artist partner who whipped up Slime and the promo art as well as everyone on Discord who have given advice and support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f1/9f1f05ce3b646f838c94d7fa138c16f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AkestorDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
