So he sets out to leave a glitch in every level of the game, ruining it for anyone who might not be as <strong>smart</strong> as he is and might actually enjoy it.</p>\n<p>You are Daniel. Play through Eubert 2 and leave glitches in each level. Make it to the end to ensure <em>no one\u00a0</em>gets to enjoy the travesty. Because, as everyone as bright as Daniel knows, <strong><em>nothing stays around forever</em></strong>, not even his favorite game.</p>\n<p>Game supports keyboard, mouse, and gamepad controls in multiple layouts, as well as custom remapping of individual buttons to your liking. It auto-saves whenever you reach a new level, so you can continue where you left off later.</p>\n<p>Due to the time constraints of the Weekly Game Jam, it only has 8 levels -- but that means you should be able to see the ending cutscene :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac8/ac8c73e06512165a63e72d011900b543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IceMetalPunk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
