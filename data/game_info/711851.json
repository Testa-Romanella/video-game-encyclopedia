I only added 2 recipes into the game, for testing purposes: Lava and Stone. In the future i think I'll add more recipes (Or maybe a system for users to submit custom to add custom resources, idk). I'll doubt i'll add more than that tho :/</p>\n<p>Again sorry if the game is barebone and lacks challanges and objectives. I hope you'll like it either way!! And i hope you a happy\u00a0Merry Christmas!!</p>\n<p>With love, your santa.\u00a0Marxy 37</p>\n<p>\u2800</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS </strong>(QWERTY Keyboard)</p>\n<strong>ACTION</strong><strong>BINDING</strong>Move CameraWASD/Arrow Keys<br/><br/><strong>OR<br/></strong><br/>Right Mouse Button + Move MouseChange Move Cam.
