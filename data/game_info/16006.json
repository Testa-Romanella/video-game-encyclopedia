Destroy everything in sight with your sheer power. You are so powerfull that weapons are useless. <br/><br/>The game was designed from the ground up focused on immersion so controlling your godly powers can be intuitive and natural. There is no weapon switching or menu selection in battle. All your powers are activated and released by your movements.<br/>Currently, battles are online with up to 8 players in an arena deathmatch. Battles can take place day or night with dynamic weather system. You better hide for your life when the clouds take over the sky with Scrios rage.<br/><br/>Current Characters:<br/><ul><li>Draken - He will overcome his foes with his sheer powers. Your enemies can't hide if you destroy everything in your way.<br/></li><li>Roho - Stealth and tactics are his strengh.
