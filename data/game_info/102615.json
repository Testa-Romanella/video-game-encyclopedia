(If unfamiliar, the concept of fan armies is a bit like Beliebers, Swifties, etc., except this game has nothing to do with music.) You, the player, have been hired and tasked by Rater Inc to rate these Husbandos. How you rate them is entirely up to you; whether by appearance or by judgement of character or any other reason. Your only task is to rate the Husbandos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features:\u00a0<br/>-RATE THOSE HUSBANDOS!!<br/>-4 Different Endings!<br/>-Make those decisions!<br/>-Spot those references!<br/>-Each play through is slightly different!<br/>-Short game!
