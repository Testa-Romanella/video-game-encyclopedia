{"id": 410097, "slug": "twilight-of-the-gods", "name": "Twilight of the Gods (itch)", "name_original": "Twilight of the Gods (itch)", "description": "<p>\"Twilight of the Gods\" is a short visual novel based on Norse mythology where the player takes on an active role in the events leading up to and culminating in the Ragnarok, the Norse apocalypse. Decisions you make throughout the game will influence the behavior of characters and lead to one of two unique endings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game and it was made a few years ago over a summer and then got buried up until just recently.\u00a0It's currently playable but extremely bare bones. Due to the fact that it's been years since I've worked on this I'm not planning on updating it, but I am looking to make more visual novels in the future so feedback on what works and what doesn't would be much appreciated!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you wanna know about future game plans, see my more recent art, and connect with me more directly feel free to join my discord server. Link is right here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/BmKeyAZ<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fefbabeb90c27d893a37cfeb3140c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kraken in your coffee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
