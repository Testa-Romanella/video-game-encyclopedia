(re)Made in Love2d, solo, in 11 days for Project Revival Jam 2.</em></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>An even more sleepless night!</li><li>15 or so unique (and upgradable!)\u00a0projectiles to stuff in your blunderbuss!<br/>\n</li><li>4 enemies! (Including an even cuter crow)</li><li>3 bosses!</li><li>Lil' itty bitty chick friends</li></ul>\n<p>This is a remake of a game I worked on with a team for Brackey's Game jam 2021.2, as the lead sprite artist. (You can play it here!)\u00a0I always liked the idea, and it's very October-y, so I thought it would be an excellent project to remake for this jam.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I think the difficulty is a little off; too much\u00a0variance in the wrong places. But it's fun when the randomness works out in your favor! And it's not as much of a deck-builder as I wanted, there's no synergy, nothing to encourage 'building'.\u00a0 The passives are just pretty standard, I wanted to make extra-interesting-game-changing perks you pick after boss fights (a la\u00a0 Slay The Spire)\u00a0 but I ran out of steam.</p>\n<p>Overall a good jam! Learned a lot, had some fun ideas, drew some fun monsters. I'm satisfied.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T12:34:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/584c50a832b1afbdf8021253d455ef13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Inkspinner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
