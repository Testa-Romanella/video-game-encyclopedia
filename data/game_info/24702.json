As each \n      stage begins, variously colored cubes form into one large object (a \n      Cubello) that floats and rotates as you play. Launch additional cubes \n      from your magazine and try to connect four or more of the same color, \n      removing them from the Cubello and eventually leaving only its core. \n      Take on the challenge of either STAGE or ENDLESS mode and watch what \n      happens when bonus time is activated! The straightforward controls and \n      goal ensure that anyone can play, while offering enough depth that even \n      advanced players will find themselves quickly addicted to the unique \n      world of Art Style: CUBELLO.\n    </p><p>\n      Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, \n      and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on \n      fun and engaging game play.\n    </p><p>\n      Check out more Art Style games!\n    </p><p>\n      For WiiWare:<br/>Art \n      Style: light trax <br/>Art \n      Style: ORBIENT<br/>Art \n      Style: ROTOHEX<br/>Art \n      Style: Rotozoa\n    </p><p>\n      For DSiWare:<br/>Art \n      Style: AQUIA<br/>Art \n      Style: BOXLIFE<br/>Art \n      Style: DIGIDRIVE<br/>Art \n      Style: BASE 10<br/>Art \n      Style: precipice<br/>Art \n      Style: Zengage<br/>Art \n      Style: PiCTOBiTS\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8c598fa63d65d8c359b48d9e2e40d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
