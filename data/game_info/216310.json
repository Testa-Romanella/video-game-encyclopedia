You control a little triangle and can move it up/down and back/forth. Depending on which difficulty you are playing on the obstacles will come at you at a high speed, your task is to simply not hit them (harder than it sounds).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Cave Racer feature three levels that all have different difficulty. There is also a infinity level where the goal is to survive as long as possible, your high score will be displayed at the main menu.
