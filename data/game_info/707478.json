You are free to switch between each whenever you please, so find the right combination and solve the level's puzzles! You are also free to disassemble yourself at any time to fit in smaller areas- be wary though, disabling a part means you can't use its ability anymore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enemies<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Be careful, the other robots on the ship have gone haywire! You can either run or defend yourself from the different types. From the standard Alpha, tanky Bravo, flying Echo, or rolling Kilo, you're free to choose how to deal with these enemies in your own way!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD- Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera</p><p>Mouse Click - Use Arm Ability<br/></p>\n<p>1 - Drop all equipped parts</p>\n<p>2 - Drop Legs</p>\n<p>3 - Drop Arms</p>\n<p>Tab + 2 - Switch leg ability</p>\n<p>Tab + 3 - Switch arm ability</p>\n<p>E (while in range of terminal) - Begin Hacking minigame</p>\n<p>(While hacking) Arrow Keys - Move Ball</p>\n<p>(While hacking) Esc - Exit minigame<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/440211465ef341030bb3e433f49974b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rob Davis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
