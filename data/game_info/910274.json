Play as the eponymous protagonist Jimmy and catch fruits flying straight from the sky!</p>\n\n<p>Your objective is to get the highest possible score by getting fruits, hearts and time! When you lose, your hi-score will be displayed on the screen. Think you can max it out?</p>\n<p>Beware of the pesky projectiles though! Those things can get you a quick Game Over if you don't know what you're doing. It's best to avoid them.</p>\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n<p>This is my first ever game I made using the Sega Genesis Dev Kit, so it's obviously not perfect. I tried making this game as a learning experience\u00a0and also because I always wanted to make a Genesis game on my own.\u00a0I have only tested this on an emulator, so if some of you got an actual Sega Genesis, I would love to see this game running on it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T09:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/81171b386b10f0384e4d37eca4be8d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swackyGCF"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
