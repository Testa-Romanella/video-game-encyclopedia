Nobody was ever sure why. You've returned to your ancestral home after several years abroad and feel unease around them. Your grandfather died of a mysterious illness. He once told you there was a demon in those woods. That it lived there since the day God kicked Adam and Eve out of Eden. The symbol of the cross kept him out for so long, but its waning has made it strong. He was never a superstitious man, but whatever lived there made him afraid. Your family is glad to see your return, but a strange white hart has gored your mother, just before your arrival. In rage, you grab one of your grandfather's hunting rifles to end this demon's life once and for all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/403a4a8fc91584f7fabb79053a6c98d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MorpheusKitami"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
