Now they're falling from the sky in a relentless attack and all we can do is dodge them.</p>\n\n<p>Use ASWD to move out of the way of the bombs to avoid getting hit. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Also: Any feedback is super appreciated, this is my first time using unity in a long bit plus I didn't have a ton of time (roughly 12 hours) hence why the game is how it is. This game was made for the Wowie Game Jam 4.0. Thanks for playing my game!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa420a4866b427161f21aa1ba56a324.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BastedEggsRYummy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
