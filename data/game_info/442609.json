But beware of pesky little thieves!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Equipped with state-of-the-art looting and shooting equipment, get ready for a big payday at a booty-packed island.\u00a0 Your top of the line treasure chest will automatically store all your shiny new items. Unfortunately, rumor has it that this particular island is inhabited by strange creatures, who will not bat an eye (thanks, animators) while stealing your precious goods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, your handy scanner transforms into the Blast-a-Foe 9001 which is all but guaranteed to stop any ill-conceived attempt at your stash. And should you run out of ammo, there's always the option of some good old-fashioned close-quarters combat\u00a0with the Whack-a-Mator transformation of your gear.</p>\n<p>Fight the onslaught of the weird (and kind of cute) army of greedy green dudes for 10 minutes and see if you got the money for the trip back home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ecd77fa15db32d9cc924089f282ce8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Peili"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
