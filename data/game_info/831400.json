This can get very time consuming so you are warned. Don't blame me if you forget to be where you're supposed to be.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is to produce the highest number possible by combining three or more cards that are adjacent to the current card, which removes all of the cards in the chain. The last card in the chain is promoted to the next highest number. The spaces in the grid that were created by the other chain cards being removed are then filled in with the cards above them falling into place, and new cards are added to the grid above them.</p>\n<p>Cards will only show a single digit number. The numbers are hex values which means they range from 0 to F. This results a maximum card value of 16 (represented as F). I have never played long enough to get to that point but I have tested it to see if it works and it does.</p>\n<p>So this is all based on the player dragging a touch through a chain of adjacent cards. Valid cards can be left, right, up or down from the current card. They can also be any diagonally placed adjacent card.\u00a0 Valid moves are indicated by adjacent cards shaking. Cards in the chain are indicated by cards with an outline on them. The last card in the chain is indicated by a large outline.\u00a0Dragging can move in a reverse direction on the chain and this will remove any cards from the chain (but not from the board).\u00a0</p><p>There is an incentive to create long chains. Each third card in the chain will increment the resulting value of the last card by one additional value. Because of this, it is possible to produce a very large number at the end of a long chain.</p>\n<p>At any point the player can release the touch and stop dragging. The drag can be resume from any card in the chain by touching and dragging once again. The chain can be cancelled altogether by tapping on any card that is not in the chain.</p>\n<p>Tapping on cards will not work when the grid is being updated with falling cards so be patient. This is supposed to be relaxing!</p>\n<p>Hopefully some of this makes sense enough to begin playing. It should become clear by just trying it out and observing what happens. I will produce a video illustrating gameplay soon.</p>\n<p>The credits value is not used at this point. I am still working on how scoring will be used. At this point the game is just a diversion.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. Let me know how it goes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T16:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b551d7f0bcc267f09b553548f5e06f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["roccode"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
