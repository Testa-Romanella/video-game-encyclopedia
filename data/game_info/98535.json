You can perform songs you know from playing a real guitar, or create your own! No previous experience with a real guitar is required.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI have recorded several development update (#DevUp!) videos while building this app, which show progress and discuss various UI/UX challenges while working with VR. \r\n\t<strong>Check out the entire playlist &gt;</strong>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Contents<p>\r\n\tThe app download (GuitarVR-2015-11-07.zip) contains:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li> <strong>GuitarVR.exe: </strong>suggested build (Leap Motion Controller mounted on Oculus Rift)</li>\n<li><strong>GuitarLeapOnly.exe: </strong>experimental build (Leap Motion Controller placed on a table)</li>\n<li>Does <em>not</em> contain additional instrument sounds! See \"AudioPack\" instructions below.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tHardware/software notes:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Required: Leap Motion Controller, with runtime 2.3.1+</li>\n<li>Suggested: Oculus Rift DK2, with runtime 0.7+</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Instructions<p>\r\n\tThe white spheres on the tips of your index fingers are your cursors. The right hand's cursor is for strumming the strings. The left hand's cursor is for selecting chords.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo strum a string, the cursor will need to be near to the string. Like a real guitar string, you'll need to move the cursor past the string to make it play a note. The strumming motion can be up/down, in/out, or in various diagonal motions.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo select a chord, move the cursor near to a chord button. The button labels show their root note (like C or A#). The chord you choose will stay selected until you choose another. You can move the cursor through the center of the chord-button ring without causing a new chord to be selected.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo change sounds, select the the \"Sounds\" menu button (below the chord selection area). The menu shows selections for each audio file present in the \"GuitarVR_Data/StreamingAssets\" folder. Select any sound in the list, and use the \"Prev\" and \"Next\" buttons (if necessary) to browse additional pages.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAn advanced feature (and one that may change) is to switch between major and minor chords. To do this, move your left thumb toward your left palm. When the tip of the thumb crosses a threshold (roughly halfway along this motion), the chord type will change. You will see some strings change color, and of course, their notes will sound different when you play them.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you're having trouble, please watch one of the \"DevUp: VR Guitar\" videos. These show a variety of strumming motions and playing techniques that might be helpful for you.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Audio Packs<p>\r\n\tTo add more instrument sounds:\r\n</p><ol>\n<li>Download \"AudioPack\" files from http://zachkinstner.itch.io/vr-guitar</li>\n<li>Unzip the download into the \"GuitarVR_Data/StreamingAssets\" folder.</li>\n<li>You should see one or more \"*.aif\" audio files in this folder.</li>\n<li>Start (or restart) the \"VR Guitar\" application.</li>\n<li>The \"Sounds\" menu (below the chord selector) will contain a selectable item for each audio file in the \"StreamingAssets\" folder.</li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tAvailable audio packs:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Standard: </strong>A collection of my favorite instrument sounds.

Often, you can open your hand wide and move it around a bit, to give the Leap Motion a clear view of your hand You can also try moving your hand entirely out of the scene, then bringing it back in again.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Leap Motion controller works best in low-to-medium lighting conditions, and in environments that don't have much clutter or reflective surfaces around. It also helps to remove rings, watches, and other items from your hands.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Links<ul>\n<li>3D Jam contest entry: https://itch.io/jam/leapmotion3djam/rate/39736</li>\n<li> Follow project updates: http://twitter.com/zachkinstner</li>\n<li>Watch project videos: http://youtube.com/aestheticinteractive/videos</li>\n<li>Business website: http://www.aestheticinteractive.com</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/faee9a424f9d9373479890a070c65b86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zachkinstner"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
