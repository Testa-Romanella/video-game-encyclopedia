Things aren't so easy, however, when jerks like the bag-snatchers try to steal children's bags of candy- chasing them as soon as they come close enough to be seen. As this young ghost, you must go between houses, finding homes with lights on that are offering candy while still avoiding the bag-snatchers.</p><p>Use WASD to move</p><p>Created by:</p><p>Miranda Holland</p><p>M Donahue</p><p>Stephen Shekailo</p><p>Alan Ganan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e541c51396e7b534f16e6557d11a6b1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeonLights"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
