Experience an exciting take on a classic game of chance! In Bingo Adventures, you are competing against other players where you need both speed and wits to win. You and your opponent get the same bingo card, and the same bingo numbers will be called in the same order for both of you. However, with faster reaction times and careful planning, you can unlock power-ups that give you the winning edge. <br/><br/>Bingo Adventures takes you to three different locations, each with its unique bingo power-ups: <br/><br/>\u2022 In the Mysterious Jungle, you can manipulate time by boosting the callout speed. <br/>\u2022 Visit the Desert Sands, where magical scarabs will add extra bonuses to your bingo lines.<br/>\u2022 Seek the Pirate Treasure and use your trusty pistol to fill in the blanks on your bingo card. <br/><br/>All bingo matches are played against real people, whether you play practice matches or real cash competitions. Once you master the game, you can play cash skill matches and enter ladder tournaments. <br/><br/>GOOD TO KNOW<br/>\u2022 Practice matches are played with HexiCoins, our free in-game currency.<br/>\u2022 Every time you play (for free and cash), you earn Skill Points that you can exchange for bonus money.<br/>\u2022 The more Skill Points you earn, the higher you will rank in our Leaderboard, where top players are rewarded with real cash prizes every week.<br/><br/>BONUS WITH YOUR FIRST DEPOSIT<br/>Deposits start at $5 and can be made with PayPal or Skrill. When you make your first deposit, we'll give you a bonus for some extra opportunities to win real money.<br/><br/>FAST &amp; SECURE PAYOUTS<br/>When you do win, don't wait weeks to get your money! We let you cash out with PayPal, Skrill or Zelle, and receive your winnings the same day. Of course, you can also have a check delivered right to your door.<br/><br/>LEGALITY<br/>In our games, all participants have an equal opportunity to win as the player's skill determines the outcome. The option to play for cash is only available in select U.S. states and countries. If you're not in a cash-enabled region, you can still enjoy our games by playing for fun with HexiCoins.<br/><br/>SUPPORT<br/>Email us at support@hexigames.com or send us a message via the Support chat in the app if you have any questions.<br/><br/>FIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SPECIAL UPDATES<br/>Facebook: @hexigames<br/>Instagram: @playhexigames<br/>Twitter: @playhexigames", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T05:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e6453f6d5ba7679f177437ac8ecf896.jpg", "website": "https://hexigames.com/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["HexiGames"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["HexiGames"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
