But then it's up to you to achieve success and take over New York City any way you like. <br/><br/>Slowly build multiple small businesses, grow them into huge corporations, or carve your own unique path \u2013 the possibilities are limitless in this vast business sandbox. You've never played anything like this!<br/><br/>Go from a small apartment and public transport to luxury suites, fast cars and designer furniture. Put your money into investment funds and real estate. Succeed, fail, rebuild. But remember to take care of yourself, sleep and stay happy on your rise to the top. <br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to build your own empire?<br/><br/><br/>Go from nothing to the most prominent tycoon in New York. Start a business, work smart, make it thrive and enjoy your life. How do you want to be successful? How far can you push it? How long can you make it last?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Start your own gift shop, supermarket, coffee shop, law firm, clothing store, liquor store, florist, and more. You decide what success is - whether it\u2019s a single shop, a chain of fast-food restaurants, a huge corporation, or making millions developing websites.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Take out a loan, rent a building, design the logo, renovate the store, get stock, manage your money, hire staff, and build your infrastructure. Soon, you may have to start importing products from the harbour and distributing them through a network of warehouses. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A bigger business means managers. Hire HR Managers, Logistics Managers, and Purchasing Agents. They all need desks and computers, so you\u2019ll need a fancy headquarters.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Need a delivery truck? Travel to a dealer and buy one. Need food? Go to a supermarket, but make sure you have a refrigerator at home. Big Ambitions is a life sim where your character has to physically interact with the world to survive and succeed. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Enter any building in New York and buy it. Go from a small apartment to a dream penthouse in midtown, a luxurious townhouse in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, or a series of skyscrapers. Fill each with furniture that suits your style and standing. Invest your hard-earned cash in real estate to grow your empire. Take over the city piece by piece. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Spend your wealth however you wish. Buy a big SUV, a speedy sports car, or the new luxurious Mersaidi S500. Maybe risk it all at the casinos or put your money into investment funds and reap the rewards. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As you progress, you always need to ensure you get enough sleep and stay healthy and happy. Enjoy the journey, for as you grow older, you\u2019ll discover that money can\u2019t buy you time... or can it?  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Big Ambitions takes what you love about the viral sensation \u2018Startup Company\u2019 to even greater heights.<br/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331550/Big_Ambitions/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T18:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/775d265ab5b73e1dfe4180ef545f64fc.jpg", "website": "https://www.bigambitionsgame.com", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 27, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 99, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hovgaard Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hovgaard Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
