Traverse this action-oriented roguelite blasting waifus on procedural generated cities to uncover dirty secrets on someone&#39;s computer! </p>\n<hr />\n<p>What is your happy place?<br />\nMaybe it&#39;s a bedroom. A calm place in the open. A bathroom. Or maybe... your personal computer?<br />\nTo help Liza on her quarantine time, Zanardi developed an interactive experience on a cozy cabin, to relax and put herself into another-dimension-for-the-mind.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this application contains a very particular bug, where she may travel to Zanardi&#39;s computer. And... while on it, she may find files and things that where hidden... for a good reason.</p>\n<p>Incarnate as Liza discovering odd secrets, fighting bunny-suit troops, deceased computer garbage, among other deep digital-creatures from the computer insides.</p>\n<p>The gameplay for Fi da Puti Samurai is quite simple.<br />\nThis is not a cumbersome rpg game, bug an action-oriented roguelite.
