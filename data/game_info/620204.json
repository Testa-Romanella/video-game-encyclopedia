Also, you are carrying a big metal ball. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK Jam 2021: Joined together.</p>\n<p>The most direct interpretation is to just physically join something to the player but who has the balls to do something like that? I do, and maybe you too. After playing around with the mechanic of chaining the player with a ball I decided to make it something like a rage game a la Bennets Foddy's \"Get over it\". So don't expect a walk in the park.</p>\n\n<p>PS.
