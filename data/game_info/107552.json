He had power beyond reckoning, and all manner of evil beasts bowed to his every whim. No one dared to challenge him or his armies... Until now.<br/><br/>\r\nHis own beloved daughter, Demetria, has finally come into her dark power, and her greed and ambition outweighs what little love she has for her father. Promising her father\u2019s armies the riches and recognition he has long denied them, she has won the support of his formidable forces. Delaney - a humble, loyal, and hardworking skeleton that has served Dragomartholomew for decades beyond counting - is the only creature that remains in the sorcerer's employ. Now, Demetria and the creatures are marching on Dragomartholowmew\u2019s last few hiding places, and it's up to Delaney to help her master stop them.\r\n<br/><em>Defend Dragon's Keep</em> is an asymmetrical co-op VR tower defense. Player one plays on the computer as Dragomartholomew, while player two plays with the VR headset as Delaney.
