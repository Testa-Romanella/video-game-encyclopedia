Choose from a cast of 48 characters then do battle in a variety of unique locations as a Team of 2-4 or in Head-to-Head Battles. Team Rush is a game that delivers a fighting experience unlike any other.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nCURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT...\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to create a game that is sort of a mashup of different things that I like. A little bit of Smash Bros. along with some Beat Em Up mechanics and some Traditional Fighting Game fundamentals. My vision was to create something that wasn't too demanding when it comes to executing combos or doing special moves. It's my hope that the casual gamer can simply pick up and have fun.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T04:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40b/40bb13b887e8b5f3d4b50340cc2c713a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["albertpierre"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
