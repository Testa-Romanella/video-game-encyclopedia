The favorite brain teaser from our childhood with good old familiar rules comes in a brand new witty look. Enjoy daily achievements and unlock cool badges which will definitely cheer you up!<br/><br/>You will meet our cute mascot Numberzilla and its friends - Croissmart, Sassy Avocado, Watermelon Warrior and others, and they will guide you through the rules.<br/>We told you, Numberzilla really stands out from other logic and math games!<br/><br/>How to play the number game? The logic is simple! <br/><br/>Cross the pairs of the same numbers (4-4, 2-2, 9-9) or those which make 10 in sum (2-8, 3-7 etc). Two numbers can be removed by tapping on them one by one. <br/><br/>In number puzzle game the pairs must be located side by side, and you can cross them vertically, horizontally and also if one number stands on the last cell in the line and another stands on the first cell in the following line of the grid. <br/> <br/>The goal is to cross out all the numbers and empty the board. <br/> <br/>When there is no more numbers to remove, remaining numbers are automatically added to the end. <br/><br/>We offer 3 modes: <br/><br/>1) Classic mode: <br/><br/>You have a basic set of numbers aligned in an order from 1 to 19 and plenty of time to set a time record! Cross the numbers, and if you run out of moves, add extra lines to the bottom. <br/> <br/>2) Challenge mode: <br/><br/>The numbers from 1 to 9 come in a random order and make a hard-drop puzzle block. Once you cross out a pair \u2013 the numbers drop down filling in the empty spaces. Unlike the Classic mode, the game is not infinite here \u2013 it will end once the board is full.<br/><br/>3) Random mode: <br/><br/>Similar to Classic mode, but the numbers are located in random order on the board. <br/><br/>This game is also known as Numberama, Take Ten or 10 Seeds. You can play it either online or offline by using a sheet of paper, but in 2019, we definitely prefer the mobile version which you can play on-the-go:) Solving a puzzle a day will help you with logic and maths skills training!
