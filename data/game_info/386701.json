It's about that phenomenon many of us are intimately familiar with, of passing the same money around in a circle to help keep each other afloat. It's about kindness. I hope you enjoy this demo.<br/></p><p>Edit: Due to an overwhelming response, I'm just going to add that if you donate $20 or over on from the demo, you get the full game for free at launch. It was going to have a $20 price point anyway, so!! As long as you leave an email, I can send you out your copy when I'm all done!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T03:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/690/690f4626b2521ada713c94fd8100a12d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kathy_E_J"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
