But your mundane existence is changed when your longtime friend unexpectedly drops his daughter off to live with you, so she can attend a music school in the city.<br/>\r\nHow will your relationship progress living with this smart, sassy and beautiful 18-year-old progress? If it does, she might be the spark your life has been missing this entire time\u2026 Or maybe not at all and her vixen of a best friend Simone might be more to your liking. <br/>\r\n     Either way, if you do choose one of the gorgeous young girls as your love interest, there might be others that might have a problem with your newfound relationships and even threaten them. <br/>\r\nGameplay:<br/>\r\nLife with Mary is an interactive visual novel in which the player makes the important decisions regarding where the story goes leading to many different endings. But please note that the different paths are mutually exclusive, and going down one path, will exclude you from all the others. And it would require multiple playthroughs to see all the content.<br/>\r\nThe development:<br/>\r\nThe current version, version 1.2 contains the full story. There will be two more updates. One in which we will add music and sounds to the game. And a general bugfix after<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe characters, story, and actions are fictitious.
