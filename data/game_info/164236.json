The game has a free directional movement which is harder than I thought to implement. and the little sprint makes the game so cool. I enjoy every moment that I slide through a guy, hope you like this game too.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em><strong>WSAD </strong>to move around<strong>, Space</strong> to sprint<strong>, J </strong>to shoot<strong> and K </strong>to collect dots as ammo</em><strong><em>!!~~</em></strong><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10e27ec82bc165f2910f26d80d25b979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erenyx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
