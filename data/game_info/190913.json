I might come back to this, since there were many more features integrated in the game\u00a0(a speaker system, level streaming, \u00a0subtitles, etc.), most of wich not included because of time constraints.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dcbcc26f0e886646de9f0e37399d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tomaspsuarez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
