Much like any wiring network graph diagram.</p>\n<p>Toggle buttons on the nodes to adjust pitch and tempo.</p>\n<p>See if you can make ANY money.</p>\n\n<p>Future plans:</p>\n<ul><li>Add a dozen more\u00a0cards, including synergies, accelerators and random events</li><li>Refine the playing surface.</li><li>Fine-tune, polish and detail.</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you think the bones are interesting, let me know how you would\u00a0like to see it improved.</p>\n<p>The game was developed solo, in Godot 3.5.2, with Inkscape, Audacity, Gimp.</p>\n<p>Code is available at\u00a0https://github.com/plexsoup/HarvestHustle\r\n</p>\n\n<p>A note about\u00a0AI utilization:\u00a0I used Stable Diffusion to create most of the card image. Sprites and icons I made myself in Inkscape. Most of the code was developed from scratch\u00a0without aid, but\u00a0I used VSCode with GitHub copilot occasionally. ChatGPT stepped in to assist with musical theory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:15:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fe60ea53e285e2602389f81c346ac03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["plexsoup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
