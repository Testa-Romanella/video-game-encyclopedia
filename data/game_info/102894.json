When you add another villager, your old one continues repeating their path from the previous day. Eventually you'll build up dozens (or hundreds!) of villagers all working together.<br/><br/>As you earn gold and purchase new upgrades, the world transforms. Can you find the hidden monsters?<br/><br/>Created for Train Jam 2016 by:<br/><br/>Design: Daniel Cook (@danctheduck)<br/>Programming: Aaron San Filippo (@aeornflippout)<br/>Sound/Music: Michael Hoffmann (@MHoffmann_S)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d6b658b4d057ff2393cd0a1e513905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["danctheduck", "Aeornflippout"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
