I know finances are tight at this time of year. I hope you enjoy the interactive story, either way.<br/><br/>If you're interested in elements like the wholesome/unwholesome mode switch, that should hopefully be appearing in a future tutorial project.<br/><br/>May the coming year treat you well, and may all the shadows you meet be comforting ones.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f11/f11aabf1c83101d2ab3b65551c48f217.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mighty Owlbear"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
