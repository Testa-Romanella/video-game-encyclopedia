They are moving back home for a time and getting back on their feet. It's a humbling experience, and a scary one. I hope this game means something to someone.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Xandris - Writing</li>\n<li>Boe - The Character Sprite</li>\n<li>Gwen/AMDev - Art, Programming, the rest. </li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tYou can help support this kind of work by donating to this project or supporting me on Patreon.
