Sadly it seems SteamVR &amp; OpenVR are no longer and XR Toolkit is the way to go forward.<br/></p>\n<p>I don't plan on continuing this game in the future but I thought it would be awesome to showcase it to anyone who is willing to try it out. Leave a comment if you enjoyed it :)</p>\n<p>The game has been tested on an Oculus Quest 2 the most, however, during playtests people were reporting that it also works on the Valve Index so let me know how well it works on your PCVR headset!<br/></p>\n<p>A lot of the foundational mechanics such as Airdusting, Screwing &amp; Game Manager code were created by a programmer, you can check out his version of the game here!: https://lifeofthecookie.itch.io/roboinc <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T15:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efe887addc0223b024296ebe59929a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
