Logistical analysis confirms that the standard procedure of extracting personnel and implementing standard shut-down procedures will incur expenditures\u00a0 which the company is unable to sustain.</p>\n<p>As a result, Demeter's head of security, Heidi Nguyen, has outsourced certain duties to a particular\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"freelancer\" as a means of expediting a more \"financially-sound alternative\"\u00a0 to depriving the company of its monetary burdens.</p>\n<p>Under the guise of \"Operation Redline\", you embark upon your duties under the code-name of \"Liquidator\".\u00a0 Your assignment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to penetrate the interiors of each mine, locate and destabilize the nuclear-powered generators, and then escape through one of the many available ventilation shafts before the entire place explodes.</p>\n<p>Due to a variety of internal circumstances, employees within these facilities have already come to expect the impending moves from Demeter's security division, and thus have taken it upon themselves to hire a few \"freelancers\"\u00a0of their own, not to mention deploying a few standard automatons which have been reconfigured for military usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to games within the\u00a0 Descent series, you pilot a hover craft with a host of weapons at your disposal , not to mention\u00a0the ability to maneuver 360-degrees of orientation\u00a0 in either direction.\u00a0 \u00a0 Keys corresponding to certain colors are required to unlock particular doors, and various machinations will attempt to thwart your progress, every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Once you have located the mine's generator, you are required to destroy it, upon which you are allocated a 30 second period to vacate the facility\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0before a meltdown occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<strong>Mouse-look</strong>Vertical and Lateral rotation<strong>A &amp; D</strong>Strafe left/right<strong>W</strong>accelerate<strong>S</strong>decelerate\u00a0<strong>Left mouse-button</strong>fire primary weapon<strong>Esc</strong>pause\r\n<p><strong>Retro Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are variety of components within the game which have been explicitly designed to emulate the characteristics and limitations of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DOS-based computer games\u00a0 in\u00a0\u00a0 the 90s era, including the following:</p>\n<ul><li>320x200 resolution</li><li>low-polygonal objects</li><li>blocky, unfiltered textures</li><li>low draw distances</li><li>an old-fashioned MIDI-generated soundtrack</li><li>pre-rendered sprites\u00a0 representing various items and pick-ups</li><li>limited frame-rate</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Other Remarks:</strong></p>\n<p>At this point, Liquidator is still within the preliminary stages of the\u00a0\u00a0 prototype phase, and the game is still beset by a large number of bugs\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innumerable components which are more than a little \"rough around the edges\", so to speak.</p>\n<p>I'll be looking to update this demo on an ongoing basis, and hopefully most of the kinks will have been ironed out within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T09:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810f6bc467867a5010f3731d4f73f119.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesse Hamm"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
