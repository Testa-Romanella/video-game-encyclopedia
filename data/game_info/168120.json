Roll, jump, slide, fall and fly through the game with levels from very easy to really hard that I had some trouble with them! This game is perfect for people of all ages and skill levels. It is a good time-waster, but also very fun. It is very smooth and can run on nearly, if not all types of computers. Can you beat all the levels and help the \"Ninja Ball\" survive them? Well what are you waiting for? Charge!\r\n\r\nInstructions.\r\nW,A,S,D or Arrow Keys to move Fowards, Left, Down, or Right.\r\nSpace Bar to jump.\r\nPress 'R' to restart the current level.\r\nHold Space to climb up surfaces.\r\nDo not touch anything that has a red X in the middle!\r\nTry to reach the finish line, as soon as you step off it you will be transported to the next level.\r\n<p>Please Report all bugs. This game is in Alpha, so it might be buggy!</p>\n<p>The game is not finished, so if there is a lack of levels, more are on their way!</p>\n\r\nUpdate Log (V0.3.0)\r\n<ul><li>Added a new City level</li><li>Added a new splash; \"OCD Killing!\"</li><li>Added a skybox to the void levels!</li><li>Added Boss fights for all finshed level sets!</li><li>Added two new \"Balls\"!</li><li>Added a new main menu music - \"Get Hyper\" By Droideka</li><li>Improved the music on the Training level.</li><li>Added a quit button!</li><li>Fixed the aspect problem - Just select the maximum pixels when starting the game.</li><li>Changed the Main Menu background back to the original.</li><li>Changed the Skybox for the Level Selection.</li><li>Fixed the world ball!</li><li>BUG FIXES!</li><li>Even Better layout designs!</li><li>AND EVEN MORE TO BE DISCOVERED!</li></ul>\n<strong>Update Log (V0.25)</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Added 3 City levels!</strong></li><li><strong>Added the new ball; the World ball!</strong></li><li><strong>Started work on a new 'Mini Game' levels!</strong></li><li><strong>Added random splashes feature, which says a different word each time you open up the main menu!</strong></li><li><strong>Added the 'Restart Level' option, which basicly means that by pressing 'R', you can restart the level.</strong></li><li><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></li><li><strong>WAY Better designs!</strong></li><li><strong>EVEN MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></li></ul>\n<strong>Update Log (V0.24)</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>More levels!</strong></li><li><strong>More Balls!</strong></li><li><strong>Added Achievements!</strong></li><li><strong>Started work on a new world, City!</strong></li><li><strong>Added a tutorial</strong></li><li><strong>Added Very Long Level (WIP)</strong></li><li><strong>Changed the Main Menu Splash</strong></li><li><strong>Added an intro!</strong></li><li><strong>Added Statistics!</strong></li><li><strong>Added and Option Menu!</strong></li><li><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></li><li><strong>Better Designs! </strong></li><li><strong>And Even MORE!!!!!</strong></li></ul>\n\r\nIn Game Achievements\r\n<ul><li><strong>Derp Ball - Fail 100 Times.</strong></li><li><strong>Super Golden Ball - Finish levels 50 times.</strong></li><li><strong>World Ball - Finish 10 levels.</strong></li><li><strong>Cube Ball - Reach 10,000 agility points.</strong></li><li><strong>Evil Sphere - Defeat the Evil Sphere in the first Boss battle.</strong></li><li><strong>*More Coming Soon*</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a8f3f2450386b2d7936909072fff33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Flame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
