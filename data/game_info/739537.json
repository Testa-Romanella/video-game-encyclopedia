Of course, things won&#39;t work out quite as smoothly as he intended. Little does he know that he is about to be dragged into a ruthless battle between powers that defy human comprehension. There will be blood. And tears. Not to mention painfully generic (yet entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way) plot twists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T19:34:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aebe9d027c7273e1a305d3a49346379b.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/1492/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
