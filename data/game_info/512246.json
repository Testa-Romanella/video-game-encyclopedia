When a ball hits a train, it will insert itself into the train. If a sequence of three or more balls of the same color are formed, they will pop, which splits the train in two. Points are awarded for\u00a0inserting a ball, and for popping them.</p><p>Created by Jason Conaway, Senior Instructor at Game-U.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/1124e60e16f2d2d49da29e4bb59e2bec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game-U"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
