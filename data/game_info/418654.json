Fly through the level without crashing to get a good time. You win if you can beat my time. Depending on your system's performance, beating me might be extremely easy or impossible; I'm not entirely sure I've made all the flight physics calculations framerate-independent.</p>\n<p>If there's enough demand (and maybe funding), I can turn this into a proper game. Some of the plans in my design doc include:<br/></p>\n<p>- Jet upgrades and different models<br/></p>\n<p>- Air- and ground-based enemies<br/></p>\n<p>- Story-driven campaign</p>\n<p>- Randomly generated missions/contracts<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> These ideas are prone to change, or may never be implemented. I can't guarantee anything right now.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fceb99b52db7a9a254414db31df63efe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ithronyar"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
