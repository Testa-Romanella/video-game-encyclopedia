It told you that you are going to die.<br/>You have 24 hours left to live. You know that this is certain.<br/>How will you spend your final day? What decisions will you make? Can you prevent your determined fate?\r\n<p>The Harbinger is a tiny horror game\u00a0about preventing your predetermined murder. Gameplay is point-and-click. It takes\u00a010-15 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>This is my first time publishing a completed game, despite wanting to be a game developer for years!\u00a0Expect something very unpolished and basic. Hopefully my next game will be an improvement. :)</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You need an internet connection to run this game!\u00a0It uses online resources and will crash if it can't load them.<br/></p>\n<p>Music credit:\u00a0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio.
