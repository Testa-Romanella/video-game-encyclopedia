Coincidentally, also my first jam ever.<br/></p>\n<p>Your objective is to find the <strong>Keycard</strong> to unlock the door and get out of there!<br/>Imagine: You're after-hours, taking the time in school to get that extra credit when all the lights go out. Using just your phones flashlight, try and find a way out.<br/></p>\n<p>I ended up spending the entirety of a day and a half trying to get fonts to work before giving up and altering the project to just go along with it- and then! Construct 3 had to get a new developer account, so I got locked out of my cloud where my project was stored until I could get back to it the following day. Let that be a lesson to myself and others to save in more methods than one..<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this extremely short entry! I did all the art myself, and the sound effects and cute ending tune was done by Trix!! Thanks a ton for all those who made their resources available for this jam, and I hope everyone had as much fun as I did!<br/></p>\r\nI had more plans that I wanted to get into this little project, like an easter egg for fun and a Quill + Paper thing for more fun secrets beyond that of the simple objective, but decided to scrap that and stick to something simple for the jam, but maybe I'll return to this in the future and add some of those fun things?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f0042ecf25433d8b771e78ce40b94bba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Choomers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
