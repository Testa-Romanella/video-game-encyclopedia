That's because key resellers don't do any quality control on the things posted for sale: They could be completely different games, fraudulent purchases being pawned off before the transactions are reversed, or keys scammed out of unsuspecting developers hoping for coverage in a difficult industry. The key resellers don't care as long as they make their cut.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe're sorry about any confusion, so here's a game about breaking Steam reviews for other games (with explosions and bullet time for good measure). We hope you enjoy exploring what people are writing about all the games on Steam. Maybe you'll find a new game to love, or even see one of your own reviews!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease consider supporting developers directly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T02:29:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d574ef19fea540cef74bc2d44682be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 100}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QCF Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QCF Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
