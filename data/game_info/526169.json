{"id": 526169, "slug": "beyond-the-forest-line", "name": "Beyond the Forest Line", "name_original": "Beyond the Forest Line", "description": "<p>Beyond the Forest Line is a 2D Tower Defense game that makes use of resource management mechanics as well as text adventure exploration. The idea of the game is to be able to develop a settlement by gathering resources from a nearby forest and then protect said settlement from the forest\u2019s inhabitants.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The resources that are gathered are used to construct and upgrade buildings within the settlement as well as create defenses during the tower defense phase. These buildings provide benefits to the player as well as allow for the exchanging of resources to further improve the settlement. The five resources that can be used in the game are wood, stone, iron, leather and villagers. There is a sixth resource known as scrap which can be used to create any other of the primary resources but has no other use.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game was created in the Unreal Engine using blueprint scripting. The limited art assets where created by me using the online Pixel art tool Piskel. The game in its current state has a lot that can be added and built upon with more intricate mechanics but works well as a proof of concept of the idea.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8ffecaf6b8fab10b23f2324f80d8371.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TDScale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
