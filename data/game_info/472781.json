The jam lasted two weeks and had the optional theme <strong>CHANGE</strong>.</p>\r\nThe Idea Behind ChangeBot\r\n<p>ChangeBot changes all the time. It can transform\u00a0from a Tiny robot that runs and jumps a lot into a gigantic, invulnerable robot. The core idea behind it was to make the player pay attention to the changes of the robot.<br/></p>\n<p>It may seem pretty obvious why I had this idea, but it's much harder than you may think. Having a good, solid game mechanic (that you can make in the span of two weeks) is pretty hard. I wonder how it would go on 48-hours jams.</p>\r\nImplementation\r\n<p>My last project on itch.io was a 2D platformer too. This time around the game is a lot cleaner and less buggy. I had some issues with the camera, but nothing is broken unlike last time.</p>Future Ideas<p>Here are some ideas I had if I ever came back to this project:</p><p>1 - Remove health system and add a battery system instead. The battery depletes over time very slowly. If you take a hit, it drops too.\u00a0</p><p>2 - Make Normal Bot and Big Bot more fun to play with. Maybe add a jet mechanic to normal bot or a charge mechanic to big bot.</p><p>4 - Some enemies run from you when you're big.</p><p>3 - Implement a zone that forces the player to a certain size for a certain period of time.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This section is dedicated to feedback.</p>\n<p>1 - The game should have checkpoints before the hardest parts.</p>\n<p>2 - The camera behaves a little strange at times. Maybe it should show more of the level or follow the player more strictly.</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Links\r\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0https://dans1997.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0https://herocrife.itch.io/ &amp; Fr00g</p>\n<p>Sound Effects:\u00a0http://freesound.org/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/</p>\n<p>Github of the project:\u00a0https://github.com/Dans1997/Your-First-Game-Jam-Change</p>\n<p>Link of the jam:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdccda93dd860c4eb0f2642874e8bb90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danillo Neves"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
