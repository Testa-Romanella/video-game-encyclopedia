From laser shooting triangles to the annoying hexagons, survive from a carnage of deadly polygons. How long can you stay alive?</p>\n<p>Hey and\u00a0welcome to my first ever game I made using Unity. Still quite new (no, REALLY new) to itch.io so I don't really know what to put here....</p>\n<p>Oh yeah stuff about the game!</p>\n<p>So you play as a circle with a cannon (the PolyGUN... get it?) that shoots stuff. You ask why a circle? Well I did some research and I found out that a circle isn't really considered as a polygon. Now going back to our game, the polygons have eliminated most of the circle peeps and you're one of the last circles EVER. Together with your circle friends (aka powerups) you must now survive an endless wave of polygons trying to kill you and emerge VICTORIOUS (no not really its endless- infinite- irrational- you die at the end whoops spoiled the story)..</p>\n<p>So yeah, if you've read this far just play the game already. Also there might be some bugs / lag issues so if you encounter some comment it down below.</p>\n<p>Also (wow still reading?) I might do updates for this, maybe like bosses and upgrades and a LEGIT story (if you haven't figured it out yet, yes, I made that all up so that I can put something seemingly relevant here) and also I'm planning on porting this to Android/iOS (but I can't put it on Google Play/App Store. I'm... still in school and game making is just a hobby of mine... maybe MORE than just a hobby) so yeeeaaaahhhh...</p>\n<p>Just. Play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7daa202d503ad4231fdeaf91c01158d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["QuazyWazzy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
