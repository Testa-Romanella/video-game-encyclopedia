You'll have to go out of the harbour,\u00a0\u00a0avoid boats , orient yourself only by using\u00a0 a compass and go back to safely dock at the quay. But don't worry there are different difficulty levels, so you can enjoy it without previous experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Right now we have only the beginner level, and we plan to extend the shore, but you can already enjoy the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Team:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ahmed Omar Mahamoud\u00a0</p>\n<p>Andrea Lucaroni\u00a0</p>\n<p>Augusto Pedron\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dario Scarafuggi</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Radio Voice- Pietro Timossi, dubbed specifically</p>\n<p>-Water Shader and system- Unity Boat Attack\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Fishing boat model and textures-\u00a0HuNtEr_3DdD</p>\n<p>-Seagull sound- Seagull on the beach by\u00a0<strong>squashy555</strong></p>\n<p>-Buoy Model -\u00a0Fabiocp</p>\n<p>-Steam Immersive Audio\u00a0https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/</p>\n<p>-SFX -\u00a0https://www.soundsnap.com/</p>\n<p>-EA Sport Font\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Sportage Font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T04:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/728/7280b405d4cea7c58c76149909c93047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coolFalco"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
