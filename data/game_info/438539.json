WITH RANDOM MAPS\r\n<p>Hey! This is a concept of the Random Map Generator that will be used in Baldi's Terrific New Game ULTRA! It is currently in very early development and will not be finished anytime soon. There is not many decorative elements because this is just a TEMPLATE</p>\n<p>You can see the random map generator by pressing play, seeing the map, trying to beat it and if you died, restarting the project. Sometimes you will get the same map a few times in a row because like I said before, this is a pre-demo. Also remember to start up 3x even when you die or complete a level. And finally! This is a horror game so boo hoo if you get scared</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>touch notebooks to get them</p>\n<p>1 to use items. There is currently no items in the early demo</p>\r\nCHECK OUT THIS AMAZING EARLY DEMO FOR THE FULL GAME!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a04/a046635df8acb14424a838f722efd128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SannesTheBoss"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
