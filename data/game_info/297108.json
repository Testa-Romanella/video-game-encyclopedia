He is given a difficult task and in order to complete it, he has to fight a dangerous foe. Or at least that's what he thought. How far will he go to fulfill a wish of a princess that he so desperately fell in love with? Will he gain unspeakable glory and wealth for finishing his dangerous task?</p>\n\n<p>Note: This game doesn't save progress between game sessions and should be finished in one sitting.\u00a0Also when you die you might need to press the load checkpoint button twice. And\u00a0I also\u00a0suggest you take a look at help in the main menu</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Frogerius - for helping with the level design and dialogues</li><li>Yardar - for helping with the sound effects</li></ul>\n\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>Added WebGL support</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/480/480365f45693d815b0892cf8671da079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EvilKiwi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
