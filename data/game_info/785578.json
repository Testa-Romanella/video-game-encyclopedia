The point of this project is to simulate an ecosystem in a somewhat realistic way while still incorporating the main logic/ideas that Conway used in his original game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is still in development as I\u00a0still need to\u00a0balance some of the elements, include some more User Interface elements, a menu screen and include some more basic interactivity with the user such as speed changes, pausing, rewinding etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any comments on this project or any feedback, or even if there's any elements you'd like to see in the game, please let me know! Would love to develop this more with more creative ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T19:10:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d64701c24a139823dfa97c214f77bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Garnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
