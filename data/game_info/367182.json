Fly around with a jetpack, pick up all sorts of ridiculous weapons, try not to fall to your death, and shoot your opponents before they shoot you! Battle it out in either a 1v1 Duel mode or a 3-4 player Free For All. With varied maps, guns, and plenty of customization options, Misfire will waste a bunch of your time when you could either be outside or reading a book!<h3>100% Lore Friendly Backstory</h3>The space marines of [insert sci-fi universe here] were getting tired of hitting all their shots with super accurate space lasers, so they decided to make an exclusive league of dualists. This league would use weaponry on the cutting edge of stupidity, only permitting guns specifically designed to shoot improperly. As the league grew in popularity so did its budget. Soon our space heros were flying around with jetpacks strapped to their backs in arenas across the galaxies! However they were still in need of an attractive name for their newborn league. After much thought, careful consideration, and many burnt out lightbulbs, they settled on the \"Marine's Intergalactic Shooting Federation Inclusive of Retired Enlistees\", or MISFIRE for short.<h3>Underdog Developer</h3>Misfire is the project of a single person under the name of Noodle Games. Not the greatest idea to make a multiplayer game on your own I know, but dammit I'm committed! I'm trying my best to make Misfire as great as possible, but until it's actually great, remember to embrace the jankiness!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75b/75b55332a1cd2c08608fb2c9f21269a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noodle Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noodle Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
