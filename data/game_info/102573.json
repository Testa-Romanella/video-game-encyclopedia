If enough people like it we hope to \u00a0finish it sometime.</p>\n<p>Orion City is a multiplayer competitive fighting game currently exclusive for the HTC Vive.<br/><br/>In Orion City, you take control of a superhuman cyborg warrior, equipped with two mighty gauntlets, containing all manners of devastating abilities. The goal is to survive a series of rounds, climbing, grappling, leaping and scaling the topsy turvy buildings of a metropolis above the clouds, Orion City, in order to capture a prized, neon glowing battery, all while avoiding police droids and battling other players.<br/><br/>Developed by a team of six, young indie developers enrolled in Kitchen Budapest\u2019s talent program, Orion City takes the sensibilities of old school shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament and uses them to create a unique, fully immersive VR experience. <br/><br/>Omitting HUD\u2019s and weapon selection screens, the player instead controls their abilities purely through a series of gestures and motions they make with the controllers. Throwing fireballs and climbing skyscrapers has never felt so real.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59ea7e721fe171cad9599487fea9bc50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevilCowStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
