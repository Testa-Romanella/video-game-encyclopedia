{"id": 594493, "slug": "vitae", "name": "Vitae", "name_original": "Vitae", "description": "<p>[This game was created during the 2020 Global Game Jam.]<br/>Vitae is about the 4 seasons of life of a man, seen from a fixed point in his family home through everyday objects in which he, as most of us do, pours time and meaning: the Spring of Childhood, with our first simple yet vivid experiences; the Summer of Adolescence, where everything constantly shifts meaning and importance; the Autumn of Adulthood, grey with responsibilities and with the lightness of youth, gone; the Winter of Old Age, when, in hindsight, one finally has the time to enjoy the \"little things\", again. Each interaction is very simple, as most of our agency in our days is, and there's a fil rouge connecting the objects through time, seemingly hinting at our common mindset through life, Season after Season.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>MADE BY LAYER42</p>\n<p>Enrico Andreuccetti (Game Design)</p>\n<p>Arianna Favaretto (Concept Artist)</p>\n<p>Pietro Prebianca (Game Programmer)</p>\n<p>Nicol\u00f2 Cornale (Game Programmer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b6837392ffbcdf80f6c9e96d813cd0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enrico Andreuccetti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
