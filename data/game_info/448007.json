You can plan your path but bare in mind your heat level is constantly dropping if it reaches zero you die. When your mouse hovers over the game character you will then control it and wherever your mouse goes it will go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do not touch any of the walls otherwise you will die. Flames increase your heat level and water droplets decrease your heat level. As you complete levels new mechanics will be introduced.</p>\n<p>Can you be the first to complete all 5 levels!!!</p>\n<p>This was my first ever game that was created years ago on Construct.</p>\n<p>https://www.construct.net/en/free-online-games/supa-hot-fire-3219/play<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/396265d3bd32e2a4066d41a050039d74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFC132"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
