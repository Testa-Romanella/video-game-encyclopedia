Use his lightforce-cyber-arm to navigate through dangerous environment. You have to reach the control center of the cyber-virus to save the planet from certain death!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>This is the demo version of a game I am currently working on. The objective is simple: Just reach the end of each level. The execution however can be very hard. I was inspired by games like \"Jump King\" or \"Getting\u00a0Over It\" ... just so you know what you are getting yourself into.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will have\u00a0 6\u00a0different worlds with 2 levels each. In this demo version you get to play the first world\u00a0(which is also the easiest). Each world will have it's special obstacles and challenges.</p>\n<p>The only way to lose in this game is to give up. It can be very frustrating and punishing but that's fun... right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is still under development.\u00a0I expect the final version to be finished in 1-2 months. Bug reports are welcome!</p>\n<p>Have fun and let me know what you think! Also let me know if you managed to beat the 2 levels!</p><p><strong>Playthrough of Level 1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Playthrough of Level 2</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d7/9d7afb0f6ca732b551f01d5db45c4ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikorashu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
