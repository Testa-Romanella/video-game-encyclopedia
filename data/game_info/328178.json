The world is filled with uncountable dangers, where even the smallest monster dwarfs the largest ship. Cannonballs will do nothing to these monsters who lurk in the depths. Instead, you must evade or distract the monsters, using light as your only true tool. Repair the lighthouses that have long been dormant, or else you will find yourself at the bottom of the Oddest Sea.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T03:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/491a6da29ad746a22f8a6f9ac6f916e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddestSea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
