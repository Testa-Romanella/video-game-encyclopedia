Wasteland is\u00a0a\u00a0proof-of-concept demake of\u00a0Blazing Sword, featuring the\u00a0first\u00a0four maps\u00a0from\u00a0Lyn's story\u00a0in a thrilling\u00a0ASCII\u00a0rendition.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> So this is based on FE7? Is there a ROM somewhere in there?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A:</strong> It is based on FE7, but I have reverse-engineered every single piece of code in this darn thing from scratch! It took me over 100 hours to get to Wasteland v2.0.0, and if you\u2019re reading this and we\u2019re past v 2.0, it\u2019s taken some time longer as well!</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> So what <em>is</em> it written in?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The engine code is C# and compiles into a .dll. The UI is a Windows Forms application, also written in C#. Friends, take it from me \u2013 don\u2019t write games in a Windows Forms application.</p><p><strong>Q</strong>: No tutorial?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Proved more trouble than it was worth, given the medium. Sorry! Though to be fair, it is a copy of Lyn <em>Hard </em>Mode, which disables the tutorial anyway.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> So how much of FE7 are you going to remake?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> For now, only the 4 stages currently available.   I had made a poor choice by limiting the game area to exactly 15x10 and decided I\u2019d stop before the first chapter that is a larger size than that (the 5th map, chapter 4). This isn't insurmountable, but combined with the murky legal area of reverse engineering an existing game, I'm probably not going to go any further than that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a13/a139f9a1d0b36faa3e874866be3602b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Storm Shark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
