Your only protection is an energy shield and your only way to heal is at Memory Upload Stations.</p>\r\nTHIS IS JUST A DEMO!\r\n<p>This is the very first demo of this game, featuring only a simplified version of the first zone. I'm mainly uploading this to do playtests, but I hope to release the full-version on steam one day. The two main features that haven't made it in this demo are a bigger focus on the narrative and a more interconnected open world. Follow me for updates if you want :)</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>This is mostly a one-man project, but Conin is contributing with great additional art.</p>\n<p>For Music &amp; Sound I used a lot of online assets.
