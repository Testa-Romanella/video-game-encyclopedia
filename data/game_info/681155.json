You gain coins by correctly matching tiles that are the same color, and the more you match in a single placement, the more coins you earn. Matching tiles with only one adjacent tile earns you no coins, so think ahead, use your powers and carefully place your tiles to rebuild and make the world as big and as vibrant as it could be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60e36bb52be05a1f92da3692440d1c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OmarK"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
