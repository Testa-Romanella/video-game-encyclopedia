In the 21st Century, they were rediscovered. Now you're part of a pioneering exchange program to the premier university in the\u00a0new monster homeland. Will you make friends or enemies with the people you meet? Will you find love? Will you return home a changed person?</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to Alasate is a game created as part of the capstone games development subject at Macquarie University.\u00a0This is a playtest prototype, so the writing is largely unpolished, and the game will end abruptly.\u00a0We would really appreciate it if you took the time to fill out our\u00a0survey after playing. Thank you for giving this your time.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is currently not mobile friendly. It should work on most laptop screen sizes without issue. Optimised for in browser playing on 1280x720 and 1920x1080 screens.</p>\n<p>Note: Itch is having some trouble loading in the images. If you wait a few seconds, they should appear.
