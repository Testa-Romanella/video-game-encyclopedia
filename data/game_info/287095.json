The overall concept is a \"three-dimensional\" interactive rave flyer in the format of a simple game. Once the player has collected all 100 kandi, they will gain entry to the \"real-life\" rave \u2013 the door will disappear, revealing all the necessary information to make it to the rave (all that would normally be found on a flyer.) The different music throughout the environment is intended to mimic the feeling of being at a party, or club. The overall look and feel is based on the sensory overload often experienced at a rave. This project was heavily inspired by 90s rave culture and graphic design on rave flyers found on ravepreservationproject.com (THANK YOU!). Special thanks to Dustyroom's Retro Aesthetics from the Unity asset store. I do not own the rights to any of the music.
