It was developed by NanaOn-Sha on December 9th, 2000.</h2>\n<p>You play as the rhyme rider Kerorican, a vivacious space girl with a large frog helmet, as she skips to the music through the games four stages. The games music is largely comprised of jazzy techno pieces. Kerorican skips down a set line while randomly placed enemies and obstacles appear before her. Various button combos will avoid certain obstacles, although a &quot;one-button&quot; easy mode is available. When you avoid an obstacle a note will sound, clearing long chains of obstacles will result in funky melodies popping up inside the song that is playing. Occasionally a crown will appear over an obstacle, if you successfully clear it you will briefly soar over the stage avoiding anything that might have been in your path. This is especially common before obstacles that might require outlandish button combos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-13T02:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d112a32f7d7af4fe4de7c0d204c6d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["NanaOn-Sha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": null}
