Limited resources and environmental hazards make it difficult enough when you don't have to deal with raiding parties of mad cultists.</p>\n<p>So, here you are. Trying to deliver one of the few surviving power sources to another settlement, when you get attacked by roaming madmen. You fend them off, but the power source didn't like the damage it took.</p>\n<p>Before the attack, it was just glowing. Now it's pulsing with power, and the pulses are getting faster and faster. You're no scientist, but you know what that means - that thing is going to blow! Your only chance is to get it delivered to its destination, quickly (and safely!).</p>\r\nObjectives\r\n<ul>\n<li>reach the settlement before the reactor goes critical and explodes</li>\n<li>destroy all raiders</li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WASD</strong> - movement</li>\n<li><strong>mouse</strong> - targeting</li>\n<li><strong>Space / LMB</strong> - fire</li>\n<li><strong>Escape / P</strong> - pause</li>\n</ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Your goal is to reach the end of the road and defeat the boss enemy before your reactor goes critical.</p>\n<p>You have some control over your driving speed - the closer to the right side of the screen you move, the faster you go. If you stay close to the left side of the screen, you will go slower and you probably won't make it in time. Hugging the right side can be dangerous, though, as you won't have a lot of time to evade road hazards and enemies. If you collide with too many objects or take too much enemy fire, your truck will be destroyed even before the reactor can blow up.</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>The game uses the `Irony v1` font by Eeve Somepx @somepx info@somepx.com</p>\n<p>All graphics were made during the compo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc5ed62746c49d23b1fe64414941c3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lucas Stark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
