This homebrew redesign of the game was built from the ground up to run on the orignal Game Boy hardware itself (meaning it will require an emulator to play on the PC).</p>\n<p>The project was made for this year's<strong> #GBJAM8</strong> (developed over the course of roughly a week) and is more of a prototype as to what the game would be like running on original Game Boy hardware so, many features may be missing or lacking polish. Hopefully, in the future, this project could be fleshed out more into a well-rounded and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/><em>Source code for this project is also available via <strong>GitHub</strong>.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>I HOPE YOU ENJOY!<br/></em></strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>Holding down <strong>A</strong> will lock the shooting direction whilst moving.</em></p>\n<strong>BUTTON</strong><strong>ACTION</strong>DPADMove<br/>SELECTMap/PauseA<br/>Shoot<br/>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>The download is a Game Boy ROM file so it will require an emulator in order to run.
