The beginner game uses halves, fourths, and eighths. The easy level includes thirds and sixths, the medium game adds in fifths and tenths, and the hardest game has percents along with all the fractions.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to win all the cards from \u201cDr. Cotter\u201d, the developer of this favorite game from the RightStart Math program. Tap on your deck to start the game, then tap on the greater value card and that player takes the cards. If the two cards are the same, it\u2019s a war! <br/><br/>If a wrong card is chosen, the linear fraction chart will pulse, indicating there is an error. The fraction chart may be enlarged to help with comparing the values. <br/><br/>The winner is the player with all the cards at the end of the game. This game will provide hours of fun fraction practice.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e30abec8b0722f82dcfbdd78f0c7af0c_PytVuv5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Activities for Learning"], "genres": ["Card", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Activities for Learning"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
