Can you brave your way through the terrors of the Delta Corp Labs?\r\n\n<p>The virus known as <em>Pathogen-X</em>\u00a0has broken out within the Delta Corp research\u00a0facility without warning, infecting and producing droves of violent mutants. As special forces agent Hawk, you've been tasked with a quick search-and-retrieval mission. Infiltrate the lab, find a vaccine, and get out before the place is nuked.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>In the demo, you'll access \"Shuffle Mode\". Fight through the sprawling underground\u00a0Delta Corp Labs, where enemy encounters, item placement, and even the facility itself are all completely randomly-generated on every playthrough.</li><li>Complete your mission successfully and you'll receive a ranking at the end! Can you reach S rank?</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Find and equip 3 different main weapons, and 2 secret ones. Mow down foes with the standard handgun, shotgun, assault rifle, desert eagle, and missile launcher.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out the demo for Pathogen-X!
