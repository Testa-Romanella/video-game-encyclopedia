This will also probably be the first and final iteration of this project</p>\n<p>Kendama Time is a kendama \"simulator\" without the strings, pressure, and possible injuries. Take your time in gaining points for a sense of fulfillment, play around with the wacky physics, and be immersed in what is possibly one of the most quiet sound designs (lmao phone recordings). Take it easy, play around, and it's Kendama Time.</p>\n<p>For those who can't play or are having problems with the browser build, you can download the 1.5 build down below and run it on your own machine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c273f84453c86bdb1eafaf400d2108ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ocean Man Kiwami"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
