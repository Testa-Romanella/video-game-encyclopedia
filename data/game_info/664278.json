Once more we need your help. This time to eliminate a very dangerous individual - a scientist that is trying to develop a WoMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction). A\u00a0bomb that inflicts the worst of all damages - makes everyone infinitely hungry. You are our only hope.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nImportant!\r\nCritical bug\r\n<p>Please bear in mind that the contains some bugs, one of them is quite\u00a0<strong>critical</strong>. Sometimes after death the player does not respawn. The game is saved after you enter each level - in case the screen goes black and player does not respawn restart game and select \"Continue\" from menu.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhich version to play?\r\n<p>If you are Windows user it is\u00a0<strong>recommended</strong> that you use the downloable version. Saving is not fully optimised and the game is having quite a lot of sounds which even with good internet connection lags it sometimes. Also when playing the web version it seems some sounds are missing completely.\u00a0</p>\r\nRecording the gameplay\r\n<p>I am confirming with Epidemic Sounds if other parties are allowed to record videos of the game with the sound. Until it is fully clarified, if you plan to record a video of the game I recommend toggling the sound off in the game menu to stay claim free.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In case the Epidemic Sound license is not suitable for recording by third parties I will substitute all the sound with sounds from other, more suitable resources.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p><strong>[WSAD]</strong> - Movement</p>\n<p><strong>[Left Mouse Button]</strong> - Shooting</p>\n<p><strong>[Q]</strong> and <strong>[E]</strong> - Changing weapon (when available)</p>\n<p><strong>[R]</strong> - Reloading\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>[F]</strong> - Interacting with environment, picking up items</p>\n<p><strong>[TAB] </strong>- Using first aid kit (when available)</p>\n<p><strong>[M]</strong> - Map and time counter<br/></p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Save your ammo as much as possible</li><li>Check achievements in the menu - this will help you to determine your gameplay style</li><li>Utilize shadows - when you are hidden you inflict massive damage</li><li>The\u00a0<strong>peaceful</strong> achievement is really hard to get especially if you try to get the\u00a0<strong>careful</strong> achievement at the same time</li><li>Remember there is no pentalty for death so you can also go full berserk!\u00a0</li><li>There are all together 5 weapons. Top 3 weapons are \"not that easy to find\". Having all of them makes the game significantly easier.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\r\nFurther plans\r\n<p>There is currently no major plan to make it full fledged game, however this may change overtime. There will be however some minor improvements to the level design. It is required to facilitate the\u00a0<strong>stealth</strong> game element of the game +\u00a0prevent some enemies from shooting the player just after the level is changed.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music:\u00a0Mission Snow by\u00a0Wendel Scherer https://www.epidemicsound.com/</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0https://www.epidemicsound.com/\u00a0and free resources\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the rest: Piotr Xiris\u00a0Wszy\u0144ski</p>\r\nChangelog\r\n<p>1.0.1</p><ol><li>Allowing to mute music and all sounds (from game menu)</li></ol><p>1.0.2</p><ol><li>Fixing critical bug that did not allow to start the game</li><li>Increasing boss hp</li><li>Increasing time that enemies wait before attacking player</li></ol><p>1.0.3</p><ol><li>Modifying elevator in Lab Entrance so player cannot get stuck in the shaft.\u00a0</li></ol><p>1.0.4</p><ol><li>Decreasing boss helath</li><li>Fixing bug where player was able to go through boss zone without killing him</li><li>Simplifying path in the escape route a little bit\u00a0</li><li>Decreasing number of gas particles</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bf617d484e6b077576663afe08b62eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Xiris"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
