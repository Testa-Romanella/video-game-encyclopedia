I wanted the terrain to be really random so I tried to incorporate a theme where that could make sense, or where it's not supposed to. Also ideas of an expanding battlefield came early on. I didn't try implementing that part of it until a good ways in and what I had originally envisioned didn't end up feeling like much of a game. What I ended up with is a lot more simple but it feels like a more solid mechanic with the potential to be somewhat entertaining.<br/></p><p>May have gone a little overboard with the equipment. There's a lot of information. Each type of equipment only has a few things it effects, but they depend on either the terrain or the type of enemy you're fighting, so that multiplies it. I ended up axing some of the things it looks like you'll eventually be able to do (spoilers you won't ever get to drain hp in this version of the game).\u00a0 I really tried to help you out some with the interface. Please let me know how I failed with that. I know most people will only play this a few minutes if at all so I'm concerned they won't even get to the point where they know what's going on with any of it. I'm liking how this works myself though, so maybe someone else will too. <br/></p><p>Third year doing 7DRL. I failed the first year. Last year's game was put together enough for me to call it a complete game. This year I feel more comfortable saying I succeeded. I could spend a lot more time balancing, hard for me to tell what a lot of values should be right now; but, I was dying a lot and occasionally making it through a zone or two, so feels about rougelike to me. I wasn't able to in the final version, but I have hope that maybe with some luck it could be beatable. So maybe skilled people will just walk through the park.<br/><br/>Made in common lisp with a nifty package that has native lisp bindings for openGL called GLOP. My first completed project where I wrote the graphics right in openGL code, shaders and all.<br/></p><p>Can be played entirely with keyboard but I added mouse support and that's mostly how I played.<br/></p><p>Hope you enjoy and/or are interested in something about it  if you decide to try it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T04:59:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fe36ab3f9851e1242ca80f1a9c09d42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AuxRuul"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
