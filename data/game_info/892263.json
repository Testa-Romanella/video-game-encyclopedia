Despite a new group working on the game, we found each other's company to be an excellent environment to build a cool idea that we all wanted to work on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0It was important for us to agree on a project that was both feasible and something we all would enjoy.\u00a0 Since we were all in that mindset, critiques never felt targeted.</p>\n<p>Our group meetings felt less like work and more like fun, and we often would get lunch or Jamba\u00a0juice separate from the work. It is way easier to work on a project like this when it feels like your groupmates are your friends.</p>\n<p>However, what goes up must come down.\u00a0 Friendship can sometimes turn into goofing off, and occasionally our meetings would devolve into a bunch of half-baked ramblings.</p>\n<p>Coordinating meetings and workdays\u00a0was difficult due to our group size and our class loads. We all had many of our other classes, projects, and jobs that made it difficult to get us all in one place at one time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We strove to include everyone in the process,\u00a0but it wasn't always simple. People got sick, cars broke down, or something went wrong.\u00a0 We also left the final build a little later than we had initially planned. </p>\n<p>The time we took off for COVID late in the semester derailed our plans and we scrambled to regroup at the end of the semester. There was a reevaluation of what enemies would be included in the game, with us eventually settling on the seven we came up with.\u00a0 One was actually scratched due to scrapped gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>Overall, we had an amazing time this semester and we are very excited to participate in CPI 211 next year.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Professor Selgrad and all the T.A.'s this semester.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Krishna Palacio for the Minifantasy asset packs.</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49c2d5753cc5f3e76ae9a798e7c7fc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Verbb42"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
