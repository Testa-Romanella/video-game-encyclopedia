If he observes you in your true form, you lose. To avoid being seen, transform into various elements that have both pros and cons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay is composed of a series of left to right levels where you jump around collecting elemental power ups while avoiding the all seeing floating eyes of the scientist. While in an elemental state, you will not be caught even if detected. You can also phase shift a short distance, essentially exchanging your elemental state for a small teleport.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The scientist has filled each level with cookies to draw you out. Grab each one without being detected to clear the level!</p>\n<p>- Element Descriptions -</p>\n<p>The water element can only move down, so you lose the ability to jump in exchange for being able to slide through grates and small places.\r\n</p>\n<p>The fire element is out of control, so you can't stop moving, but you get a powerful speed buff.\r\n</p>\n<p>The air element turns you into a floaty bubble, giving you WASD to move anywhere you want, but if you bump into anything you pop and perish.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>With the earth element, you become a patch of mud, with the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings. But be careful, because if you remain in this form for too long you'll harden and become unable to move!\r\n</p>\n<p>- Controls -\r\n</p>\n<p>Keyboard\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A/D to move\r\n</li><li>Space to jump\r\n</li><li>Shift to phase shift\r\n</li><li>'R' to restart\r\n</li><li>'Esc' to exit\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Controller\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Right analog to move\r\n</li><li>Left analog to aim your phase shift\r\n</li><li>'A' to jump\r\n</li><li>'X' to phase shift\r\n</li><li>'B' to restart\r\n</li><li>'Start' to exit\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffc/ffc9fcc080ae01341a81ef3d6fdd2506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YDOG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
