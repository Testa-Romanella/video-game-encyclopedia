You have a tiny little ship, capable of only firing straight ahead. Your weapons are puny until you power them up, and even then seem decidedly inferior to what you\u2019re fighting against. Your armor is apparently made from paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and usually can\u2019t even survive one hit before you blow up and lose all your toys.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile\u2026</p>\n<p>Over on the other side of the screen, the boss is chortling gleefully, launching wave after screen-obscuring wave of bullets in beguilingly beautiful patterns, the merest touch of which will destroy your ship. All while absorbing enough damage to sink an aircraft carrier, without even getting his paint scratched.</p>\n<p>It hardly seems fair!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not fair, in fact!</p>\n<p>Haven\u2019t you ever wished that that could be YOU over there? Calmly making horribly devious patterns of deadly bullets?
