One month of development and a size limit of 13kb is a fun challenge but isn't a recipe for a game without flaws. The itch version is mainly untouched but adds music and is a bit more polished. The gameplay and level design isn't touched at all though. Just by adding music the file size grew ~500 times!</p>\n<ul><li>Original game jam version:\u00a0https://js13kgames.com/entries/backstabber-hero</li><li>Created by Niklas Berg / The Infinite Monkey</li><li>Music from OpenGameArt:\u00a0Laid Back by Spring Spring, Puppy Dog\u00a0Swing by Spring Spring and Victorious by SpiderDave.</li><li>The game uses a heavily customized and outdated version of Kontra.js.\u00a0</li><li>Zzfx was used to create sound effects.</li><li>Interesting fact 1:\u00a0The game randomizes skin colors at each run</li><li>Interesting fact 2:\u00a0The game has a PWA manifest which means that you can install it on your android mobile.
