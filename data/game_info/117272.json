It is planned to be a boss-rush style of game where every day sees the player encountering a new challenge. As of the current build, there is only one boss, though there are currently 8 different ways of building your character through the attunement facility in the hub.<br/></p>\n<p>As this was an entry to an open source jam, Source code may be found\u00a0here. And the repo will continue to be updated as more work is put into the game.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>Press X to Jump</li><li>Press and hold C to throw your mask</li><li>Press A to warp to your mask</li><li>Press S to use your Special Ability</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/079f05b74f84ca3b8c87aa1d410fb2b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pikethorn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
