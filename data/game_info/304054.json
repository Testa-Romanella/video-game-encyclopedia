This includes the Granger\u00a0Dolls.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>You are a child, and you're saving 9 dolls...</em></strong><br/>Taking the role of a cursed child, you enter the dungeon to save the 9 Granger Dolls out of desperation. But what was about to be offered is not as good as it seems. You are the cursed child and he is you. Whatever happens to him, happens to you. Rubithed isn't meant to play to win. Instead, try to immerse yourself into the shoes of the cursed child. Can you outlast the dungeon's trickeries?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Trust nothing...</em></strong><br/>The dungeon is not to be ventured into, you're tainted and branded from the moment you took a step into Cell Area 1408. Do not trust your eyes, do not trust your instincts, do not trust the dark or the light,\u00a0do not trust anything you met in here.</p>\n<p><em><strong>To escape? Or not to escape...</strong></em><br/>Do not always set your objective to\u00a0escaping the haunted dungeon. Even if you escape from Cell\u00a0Area 1408, you can never ever escape from Cell\u00a0Area 1408...<br/></p>\n<p>=========================================================</p>\n<p>Recommended settings:</p>\n<ul><li>1600x900 on full screen</li><li>Turn your volume up until you can easily immerse yourself into the game</li><li>Try to aim for at least\u00a0\"Good\" graphics.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movements: WASD / Mouse</li><li>Inventory: Tab (This won't pause the game)</li><li>Lantern: C</li><li>Map: Q (This won't pause the game either)</li><li>Skipping Night 0 Tutorial: F5</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-25T02:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e6bebf6c9244dc574b21931c6160f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeventyFour Productions", "Bro.
