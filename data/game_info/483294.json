As a beginner I didn't have much time to implement features as high score, title menu and not even\u00a0sound effects. I've learnt a lot at least. Anyways hope you enjoy my game. It's an endless runner\u00a0where you need to avoid getting run over, the vehicles get faster and faster as you go on. Good luck!</p><p>I\u00a0 used GLES3 instead of GLES2 to get the particle system working correctly (still some issues with it though), unfortunately this makes it only accessible in some browsers, so let me know if I should upload it in GLES2 as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f272f8d4a37b4cdb4fe09a014650589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IsaacK0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
