The higher your mood, the more guests will enter your park.</p>\n<p>The guests spawn in the center tile of the park entrance, so you will have to build your paths from there.</p>\n<p>Guests can only walk on paths (and paths with trashcan)</p>\n<p>The entrance to attractions always is the bottom left tile of the attraction, so make sure to build a path there.</p>\n<p>if you're interested, you can see some more backend information by pressing TAB. You can see the paths of the people in your park.</p>\n<p>Also you can see by how much your attractions are filled (orange bar above attraction) and how many people are currently waiting to enjoy</p>\n<p>the attraction (grey bar above attraction)</p><p>The controls are in the README.txt, which is in the .zip.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me via itch.io or mail: jan.ehehalt@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Repository btw: https://gitlab.com/JanEhehalt/AmusementPark</p>\n<p>:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f4b7ed9b9e403b14d2feda89d57e5d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JanEhehalt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
