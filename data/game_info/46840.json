Nice, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you have the control over a little machine gun in the middle of the geometry polygon that is being invaded by different geometry shapes. The trick is - each shape has a certain number assigned to it that represents the number of times it has to be shot to disappear. There are squares, triangles, spheres, hexagons and pluses attacking you. As you progress throughout each level, you will be given a chance to increase the firing rate of your machine gun by shooting at the LVL.UP spheres. Another nice trick is to use ricochets and calculate their angle - that way you can hit several shapes using one bullet. Think about which shapes you should aim for sooner, and which later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a2d7895eb9f1e91c3e0dd608c8a815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floop Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
