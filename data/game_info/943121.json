It probably\u00a0takes\u00a010-15 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>This game was made in three days for Lame Jam 26! The theme for the jam was \"Control the Environment.\" I hope the game is\u00a0suitably lame. :)</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You need an internet connection to run this game!\u00a0It uses online resources and will crash if it can't load them.</p>\n<p>Music credit: Sirius Beat - The Cosmos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T22:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/196855a627ff9e07221907e1e0871286.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stev51"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
