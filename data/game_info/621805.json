Stack them\u00a0to create different shapes to fit through\u00a0the wall, that will slowly approach you. If you can't manage to make it in time the wall will happily throw you of the platform. Try to collect as many coins as you can without losing too many boxes.\u00a0You can click on a box to control it. If you click again in the scene you will release the box. If you release it next to another box it will join together. That way you can make even more crazy forms!\u00a0Good\u00a0luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Find us at:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nBusiness Goose\r\n<br/>\r\nBeau Vankemenade<br/>\r\nJonathan Wolfs<br/>Sander Ambroos<br/><br/>All art assets and coding have been made\u00a0during the Game Jam.
