To avoid capture you have to stay in the dark, but watch your step! The dark conceals more than yourself, it hides everything around you!

Oh, and also! Watch out for the guards and the searchlight looking for you!</p>\n<p>Supports: Keyboard + Gamepad<br/>Recommended: Gamepad<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:45:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8eb/8eb5db9ab803ab1b385fe98eed118942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AfterTwelveEntertainment"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
