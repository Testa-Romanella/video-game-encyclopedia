Normally clipping/glitches are unintended and can lead to skips, but in this game you use them to beat levels.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The built-in dialogue system should teach you everything you need to play the game. If you get stuck, press R to restart the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Jam Submission</strong></p>\n<p>This game was a submission to the Explosive Game Jam where the theme was \"out of bounds\". I didn't have as much time to work on this as I'd hoped due to school and whatnot, but It's still a decent prototype of what I had in mind. I tried to make it fast-paced, with the slide mechanic allowing for huge speed and air strafing to redirect momentum (I\u00a0also considered a bhop type mechanic but did not have time to implement it).\u00a0Perhaps in later updates I will add new mechanics and levels. Also, the geometry could use some polish and the graphics could be much better. Sound effects,\u00a0 a HUD, and menus would also be in order.\u00a0Anyways, I hope you enjoy playing my short game!<br/><br/>- Toadi<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007bec137dfcd44e7e70772cd88c827b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toadi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
