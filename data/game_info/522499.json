Force your enemies to take the most difficult paths, skewer them with spike traps, riddle them with arrows, freeze them with unstable cryo-mass, and much more. Unlock abilities and research new technologies in order to ensure your defenses will hold. Dynamic and randomly generated enemies ensure no two waves are exactly the same. wave after wave will crash down upon you, but you must weather the swarm.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9a16af012d21fe571410387aca0b793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChaiTae"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
