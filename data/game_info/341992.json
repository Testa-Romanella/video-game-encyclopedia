This is very cheap to use, and can give you a huge advantage especially when trying to sneak up on enemies while their backs are turned.</p>\n<p>Invisibility - Expensive, but extremely powerful; invisibility lets you go completely invisible for the duration that it is active for. Enemies and turrets will not detect you, allowing you to walk into a room, take out the target and retreat, without anyone knowing you were there.</p>\n<p>Turret Override - Turning the turrets rogue, this ability causes all turrets in a 15m radius to view the guards as hostiles. This also turns nearby turrets friendly, which is useful for crossing turret-watched areas.</p>\n\n<p>The game's not great in all honesty, but it was made in only 6ish days; so there's that :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T04:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63bfe370c783e34696cdd893a7245af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PowerfulBacon", "Supermafia00"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
