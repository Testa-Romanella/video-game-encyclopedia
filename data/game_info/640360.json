This Jam theme was gold mind you ;) so we went with the idea that you control a little gnome in a platformer trying to locate his stolen gold. Since that was a bit hard to do, the guy shoots gold from a bagpipe. Hope the Game will bring you joy and pain.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Controls\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to move, Control to shoot and Spacebar to jump.\r\n</p>\n<p>By psznm</p>\n<p>Art By Auto description by me hehe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T03:41:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcd336e748745757dcd20bf7742fd86f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["psznm", "Auto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
