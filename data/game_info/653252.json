There was a time when this land was filled with people, towns, and life, but that Collapsed. We live on the grave of a once-great civilization; its headstone warns us to \u201cLook on our works, ye mighty, and tremble.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>The eldest among us say they brought it on themselves, while our explorers and historians say that is too narrow a view. It is from that debate our tradition grew.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>When someone comes of age, we send them out into the wilderness surrounding our Village. We send them out to map the land, forge connections with other villages, and seek out resources and remnants of the past.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>While we don\u2019t actively seek answers, sometimes they come to us. They did something, and it cost them everything. We make our homes in that civilization\u2019s bones and grow our food in what was once its flesh.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Nothing else remains.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Using a deck of cards, you and some friends will explore a wasteland, and build card house Ruins to explore. You will find ruins of a previous civilization, and meet the denizens of the current world.\u00a0The mechanics of this game take inspiration from the Carta system by Peach Garden Games and Loot the Room\u2019s Wretched and Alone system. The Dice Tree mechanic is inspired by Robert Bohl\u2019s <em>Misspent Youth</em>.</p>\n<p>This is an open-world exploration game set in a post-apocalyptic setting for 1 to 4 players. This game draws inspiration from the Walking Simulator genre and Open World exploration games such as; Sable (the demo, at least), Breath of the Wild, and Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6fc35ba3834c3d1f0c03d595b259e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theinstagrahame"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
