But beware of the pissed-off Oompa-Lompas and don't run out of time ! Throughtout the level are\u00a0<em>Altars of Boris</em>\u00a0where the player is asked a question on the association, that can give a major bonus of points. Compete for the highest score of candies !<br/><br/>----------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong> :</p>\n<p>Henri 'Biscuit Prime' NOMICO - Lead developer and project manager : https://github.com/BiscuitPrime</p>\n<p>Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e 'Akasunaa' TONEATTI - Developer : https://github.com/Akasunaa</p>\n<p>Hugo 'Kohuro' CARBIENER - Lead graphist : https://github.com/Hugo-Carbiener</p>\n<p>Louise 'Lousch' SCHNEE - Graphist : https://github.com/Sherlousch</p>\n<p>Chlo\u00e9 'Skizaat' HENNEQUIN - Lead Music Designer : https://github.com/Skizaat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T09:59:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c2/7c27e20561f9c282eefd7c7815a405e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BiscuitPrime", "Skizaat", "PrometheeT", "Hugo-Carbiener"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
