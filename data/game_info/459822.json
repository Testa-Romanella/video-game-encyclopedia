Solve each level in this charming game so that you can be together with your golf-ball partner.</p>\n<p>This game was created in 12 hours for the United Game Jam 2020. I incorporated the theme of two by making a 2D puzzle game. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the game character's partner so that the couple will be reunited.\u00a0Another way I incorporated the theme was through the game's color scheme.\u00a0</p><p>I honestly am a complete beginner when it comes to GameDev. This not only my first Game Jam, but my first finished game. Any feedback will be much appreciated!</p>\n<p>ASSETS USED:</p>\n<ul><li>Art - Drawn during the Game Jam by discord user ell.bell.tea#9195</li><li>Music - Theme by Chopy61#4413</li><li>Sound Effects:<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/completion-sound</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/bow-arrow-shot</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/punch-slap-n-kick</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1a8003bc52c63b159d54122eef1861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jteaaa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
