{"id": 302698, "slug": "zero-g-race", "name": "Zero-G Race", "name_original": "Zero-G Race", "description": "<p>This game was first made during a <strong>GameJam </strong>at my university (UQAC), with a team of 7 students.</p>\n<p>Theme: Pressure</p>\n<p>Styles: racing, strategy, survival</p>\n\n<p>The game is 2-player racing game into space. The players will have to reach their ship while avoiding all the obstacles one can find into space.\u00a0We chose a funny way of moving around to implement the pressure as a core system: the astronauts move with a fire extinguisher.\u00a0 The players will also have to manage their gas, which is not unlimited; several stations will spawn amidst asteroids and blackholes, to refill the gas in the extinguisher. They will also give items, as in Mario Kart, to help the player or to hinder their opponent.</p>\n<p>This version is not exactly the one we delivered within 48 hours, I improved it a little afterwards. You can download the original GameJam version here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T03:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/0165400b07896fc17aa0f819f9d404a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AurelienGttn"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
