{"id": 311703, "slug": "voodoo-vince", "name": "Voodoo Vince", "name_original": "Voodoo Vince", "description": "<p>Voodoo Vince is a 2003 platforming video game created by Clayton Kauzlaric, developed by American studio Beep Industries and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox.</p>\n<p>In the game you play as Vince, a voodoo doll who can perform an assortment of moves to make his way through the levels. Vince can perform standard moves such as jump, punch, and a spin attack. The game revolves around Vince&#39;s ability to use voodoo powers, which the player can get by finding special voodoo icons scattered through the game. When Vince&#39;s voodoo power meter is full, the player can use a voodoo power to destroy every enemy nearby. Each voodoo power hurts Vince in a unique way, but they all have roughly the same effect on Vince&#39;s enemies.</p>\n<p>Scattered throughout the game&#39;s levels are special items for Vince to collect: Zombie Dust Bags, which upon collecting 100 will increase Vince&#39;s health bar; Hearts, which give Vince extra lives; Beads, which are collected from fallen enemies and fill Vince&#39;s voodoo power meter; and Skull Pages, which upon collecting all in a certain level will reveal a Skull. If the player manages to find, chase, and capture the Skull, it will increase the number of voodoo powers Vince can perform at one time. Many levels also offer a trolley station, which allow the player to travel between different levels of the game.</p>\n<p>Many of the game&#39;s levels have some sort of puzzle in which Vince must activate some sort of device in order to use it to inflict pain on himself to destroy a larger enemy (the bosses in particular). For instance, in one of the first levels of the game Vince must defeat a pair of unruly gas pumps, by setting himself on fire and then throwing himself in a puddle of gasoline surrounding the gas pumps.</p>\n<p>Several levels differ from the standard gameplay the player will experience through the rest of the game and involve piloting a vehicle or playing a minigame. Over the course of the game, the player will control Vince piloting an airplane, a swamp boat, a submarine, a bumper car, and other vehicles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T02:13:46", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
