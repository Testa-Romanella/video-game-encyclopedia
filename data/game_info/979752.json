You can expect new handcrafted puzzles, hauntingly beautiful locations, and challenges for your brain\u2019s gray (or blue) matter. You will be able to look at the world through the eyes of one of the most famous inventors, the father of electricity, the man behind alternating current, the science wizard, Nikola Tesla.\n<br/>\nYou will need to be industrious and peer under the surface to prevail.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nScience brings mysteries toward the light one by one, strips them of their secrets, and makes them part of something greater. It is true that some myths are rooted too deeply, are too resilient, and even seem like having a mind of their own as they resist men of science trying to shine the light of understanding. But in the end, science and mystery are anything but anathema to each other. On one stormy night, a person was brought to this world. A child of darkness and a child of light, full of mysteries and full of scientific curiosity, just starting to build a myth of their own.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will explore the eerie abandoned industrial buildings of Nikola Tesla\u2019s most ambitious facility in Wardenclyffe, which was meant to become an important city where the future is today and every societal process is improved upon by the principles of free wireless electrical energy. \n<br/>\nThrough the eyes of the man himself you\u2019ll watch the important moments that lead to the construction and later to the fall of the famous Wardenclyffe Tower, and slowly uncover the mystery that left you stranded among deserted machines.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Fresh locations based on real places and plans of the enigmatic Nikola Tesla\n<br/>\n</li><li>Mysterious story from our take on the Progressive Era America\n<br/>\n</li><li>New dynamic approach to storytelling using flashbacks into the past\n<br/>\n</li><li>Use a device that allows you to see and influence the flow of electricity \n<br/>\n</li><li>New handcrafted puzzles to challenge yourself</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T14:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f719a1861b1bc5e04711ba400fc2b771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Brain Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Blue Brain Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
