Lock and load a barret 50 cal automatic rifle that can take helicopters out of the sky or strafe a platoon from a distance. Do whatever you want with the gun, just don't shoot the puppy. That's right. It's all fun and games until a puppy gets shot, then you lose the game. So, as I said: you have your machine gun and there is a puppy, both of these things should co-exist without ever crossing over. For example, you can shoot your gun, but don't shoot it AT the puppy. This is basically all you need to know to play Don't Shoot the Puppy. A lot of people get confused. They see the title and they see the game and they wonder \"can I shoot the puppy?\" I'm here to tell you \"no, don't shoot the puppy.\" I don't want to have to repeat myself but I understand there might be a language barrier, maybe you have a hearing problem or perhaps it's just so ludicrous to not shoot a puppy. But to be clear: We will not be shooting puppies in this game. Maybe you've played other games where puppies are shot, and that is horrifying, but it's not how we do things around here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T09:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/1822d188720111653e01f73637b92ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snail Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
