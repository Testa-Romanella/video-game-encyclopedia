It is a boot-sector game.\u00a0The computer can directly boot the game with no OS at all! \u00a0There are plenty of ways you can run the game:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>DOSBox:</strong>\u00a0\"BOOT snakelight\".\u00a0From the command-line:\u00a0dosbox -c 'boot snakelight'</li><li><strong>QEMU:</strong>\u00a0From the command-line:\u00a0qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=snakelight</li><li><strong>86Box:</strong>\u00a0Attach the \"snakelight.img\" file that has been padded to the length of a full 160K floppy disk.\u00a0Configure a machine with i386SX or better; I found good results using\u00a0the NCR PC916SX\u00a0with video over an [ISA] CGA adaptor.\u00a0Simply press ENTER when prompted after the warning about lost battery power.</li><li>If you're feeling particularly brave, it is possible to flash a bootable USB and try on a real PC.\u00a0It works on my laptop, but I cannot guarantee safety or\u00a0compatibility with your system.</li></ul>\n<p>However you go about loading the game, you are presented with a checkered grid of lights.\u00a0You want them all dark.\u00a0Press any key to begin, and you will be immediately set in motion.\u00a0Rotate with J/L, and toggle the lights with the Spacebar. Each toggle makes you longer:\u00a0your skill at steering your snake is the hourglass that determines how long you have to finish the puzzle.\u00a0If you win, the game will pause for you to revel in your victory.\u00a0You can play again\u00a0by pressing any key. If you lose, the game will again pause, waiting for your keypress to command a restart.</p>\n<p>At only 512 bytes, the entire game fits easily\u00a0in a QR code with no compression at all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T07:27:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52dc5566b4c58a0ac4d12eb8f0d956c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pineberry Fox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
