You have three health and when you collect wrong fruit, you'll lose one health. When you collect food, the game will slow a bit(currentMoveSpeed - (currentMoveSpeed / 40) ). So if you collect the right fruits nonstop, the game will last longer.</p>\n<p>Sounds: freesound.org</p>\n<p>Fruit assets: kenney.nl</p><p>Developed Solo by Berk Kalelio\u011flu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/4260ca343b94b626b50fee08a492d7b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MildBK"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
