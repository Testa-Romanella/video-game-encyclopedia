Click on a checker and then on the tile you want to move it to to move it. ESC to skip the intro text. <br/><br/>If a move you pick is invalidated by a move black makes before your move goes into effect, you will be allowed to pick an immediate move to make up for it.<br/><br/>If you seem to be unable to move a chip, double check that you a) are taking a jump if one is available and b) are chaining all jumps if that is possible for that chip.<br/><br/>Theme Interpretation:<br/>The \"unfair advantage\" of this game is in Black's favor, as they can see all of your moves in advance- meaning they can respond to stop you before you even act. This also makes the game require a different mindset to play than normal- every move must be planned a bit further in advance.<br/><br/>Repo:\u00a0https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/foretold<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:31:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/515f65745946abd4e9d3e94148cea6fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Promethia27"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
