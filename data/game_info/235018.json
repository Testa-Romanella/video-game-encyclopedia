With the most powerful Go software available for the iPhone or iPod Touch, Igowin will challenge you no matter what your level, and keep you at the top of your game.<br/><br/>Igowin uses the same Go engine as The Many Faces Of Go. That's the three time world computer Go champion that has been in ongoing development for over 25 years. It draws on more than two and a half decades of experience, a massive knowledge base and the newest research, as well as modern Monte Carlo techniques to help you learn and grow as a player. This is, hands down, the strongest Go engine available for the iPhone or iPod Touch.<br/><br/>Igowin has the most comprehensive tutorial of any app of its kind. You get a good solid understanding of the game, and can begin playing immediately. With no complex menus and just a few basic controls, the game is easy to navigate. The convenient \"undo\" feature lets you reset a mis-tap, without waiting for the computer to finish thinking. All levels are calibrated by play, on an online server. That means that the ranking Igowin gives you is very close to what your real-world ranking would be, rather than an arbitrary number that only applies within the app.<br/><br/>Igowin uses the traditional Kyu ranking system to measure your performance.  The engine automatically adjusts its level of play to match yours. By using the calibrated rankings within the Go engine, it can play a 9x9 even game, with no handicaps, against any player, from beginner all the way up to 3 dan level.   <br/><br/>Whether you're a rookie looking for a fun new way to learn and play the game of Go, or a crafty veteran looking for a challenge, Igowin is the app you've been searching for. Take Igowin wherever you go, and play it whenever you have a few minutes to burn.  It's always ready for a quick game, or a long session. <br/><br/>With Igowin on your iPhone or iPod Touch, you're ready to start playing the 4000 year old game that takes a few minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b6b0226a8953de6c1de9e3fc0266967.jpg", "website": "http://smart-games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Smart Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Smart Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
