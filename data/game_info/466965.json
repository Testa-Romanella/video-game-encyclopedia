The theme was \"Out of Control\".<br/><br/>I Interpreted it as a way of making a game\u00a0without any regular controls from the player as in mouse or keyboard. Instead, I decided to use your voice as input! Not voice commands but rather the mere existence of sound.<br/><br/>Control (or not?) a marble by using your microphone to maneuver obstacles conveniently designed and placed in a board of wooden cubes full of speakers that follow a beat or the sound of your own voice?! Don't judge me, i barely had enough time after I finally got the mechanic working.<br/>But wait, isn't judging sort of the point here? I need sleep.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>- No controls, just have a microphone, try to get to the end, it's rather short.<br/>- Didn't have plenty of microphones to test with, so added a calibration option in case there was too much noise, or mic was too low.<br/>- What I usually used while testing is simple words like\u00a0\"go\", \"jump\", the sound of\u00a0snapping my fingers or pretending to talk to my pug for the fear of seeming lost all semblance of sanity to anyone around me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/8386137066fd6a30229c63644a724d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mwattar11"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
