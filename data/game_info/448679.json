Sole physicsbased puzzles in a 2.5D environment in order to proceed. Find Items on your way to help\u00a0 two monkeys escape. Hide from guards to not be put into cages again (or use them to you advantage \ud83e\udd14)</p>\n<p>The game consists of a tutorial level and two full levels with increasing difficulty. The UI is currently implemented for gamepad input, but keyboard input works fine as well.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Background story:</strong></p>\n<p>The Animal Circus is one of the most fun experiences a human can attend. Animals and their tamers put on a show that leaves everyone in a euphoric state. When the curtains fall though, a different tone of scream falls into dead ears: Agony of animals break the silence, while they are berated for the small hiccups that happened during the show, or just to fulfill the sadistic nature of certain humans \u2013 the reasons became fuzzy after a while.</p>\n<p>Two monkeys, part of the circus, have had enough and on one night decide to leave their abusive home for good. They cannot escape the place alone though, they have to work together to suceed. If that would not be enough, the monkeys have to avoid getting seen by the humans\u00a0 \u2013 and sometimes thay even have to be smarter than them).<br/></p>\n<p>The game starts with the monkeys practicing in the circus tent. Nothing of the hostility between humans and animals should be visible to the audience. The players learn how to control their monkeys, how to interact with objects. But then the monkeys are put in cages behind the circus tent. There is one main goal: escape the circus. The only place where that is possible is through the main entrance \u2013 the other paths are guarded or barricaded with electronic fences. The necessary steps to escape thus are: Find a way into the circus tent and then \u00a0proceed beneath the roof using the objects used by the other artists.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>B\u00f6rge Scheel, Linus Wigger, Rudolf Varga, An\u0131l Yar\u0131\u015f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7fd7679b5f37aa5ce20f44cfbfa386d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bscheel"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
