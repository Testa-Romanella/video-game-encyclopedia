Each player carries a gravity cannon capable of pushing enemies (and friends) down from the heights of the arena.<br/><br/>When a player scores, he receives a genetically modified super-seed and gets the opportunity to plant it onto a platform to capture it. To win the game you must capture towers and construct a node system from your goal post all the way to your opponents' goal post.
