The ending was supposed to be that you \"sacrifice\" your arcade tokens to gain access to the credits area. Instead we just disabled the timer and let you freeplay.</li>\n<li>We had plans to add multiple grinding and air tricks but due to time, the only trick is dabbing while grinding.</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Colby Klein - Art, Programming</li>\n<li>Landon Manning - Programming, SFX</li>\n<li>Jackson Drummond - Music</li>\n</ul>\r\nChangelog\r\n<ul><li>v1.01: Added low res (\"potato mode\")\u00a0toggle\u00a0on F6.</li><li>v1.02: Fixed a very bad performance bug.
