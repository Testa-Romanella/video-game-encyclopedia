For these set the placement mode (X) to 'instanced', and enable auto-rotate (C). Then you can draw little runs of dominoes all you like.</p>\n<p>To trigger them just spawn a whole bunch of cubes above the run, or otherwise disturb them (Sorry, didn't have time to implement the physics gun..)</p>\n<p>Overall it's not much functionality but should be a solid base for future work. There's a level format, the ability to save levels for later, and a way to define new primitives through blender/some ingest tools. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Currently runs on desktop Windows/Linux, but could be built on any platform with Rust support.</p>\n<p>One of the initial goals was support for running in a browser, unfortunately that's not possible right now (Will need to rework/replace the renderer).<br/></p>\n<p>Source code is freely available for now: https://github.com/geefr/rust-goldberg<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0a71e2d17acb97c64f94ef6bf115b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["geefr"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
