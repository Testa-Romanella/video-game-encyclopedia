Thats all.. Alot I know :P</p><p>this game was made in 25 hours for the Ludum Dare compo event.</p><p>---Key bindings---</p><p>wasd = move around</p><p>mouse = look around</p><p>e = inventory / crafting menu</p><p>alt = build mode</p><p>------------------</p><p>There is something called buildingMode and that is the state your character is in when your building.</p><p>It makes you see where your walls/doors/windows will be placed. The indicator that says if your in building mode or not is your cursor. if it is using default colors it will be pink/purple when your not in BuildingMode but when you are its orange.</p><p>---Good things to know---</p><p>-Only because this is a ludum dare version i made it so everyone starts of with 1 wall, 1 door frame and 1 window frame.</p><p>So you can get a hang of the building. You can ofc still cut down some trees to make more walls etc.</p><p>-Customizable crosshair colors to distinguish from when your in BuildingMode or not.</p><p>-I will be updating the game over at gameJolt under the judging period. </p><p>Ofc with a new link. Comming soon ^^</p><p>-To free your mouse and lock movment press Esc.</p><p>-If you select an item from the inventory you will automatically be in BuildingMode.</p><p>-HAvE FuN. ^^</p><p>## LINKS</p><p>- Windows (itch.io): https://thesand.itch.io/chunk-world</p><p>- Windows (gameJolt): http://gamejolt.com/games/chunk_world/251744</p><p>- Ludum Dare: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/$16922</p><p>- Source Code: http://www.mediafire.com/file/71n2y51c5h5d650/Ludum_dare_38.zip</p><p>- Trello: https://trello.com/b/kgkPLPZL/chunk-world</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f160d0b98258034919c4ba7c721171f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thesand"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
