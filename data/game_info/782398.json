(Jazz, Lankor, JoshB47, revenir)", "description": "<p>Overall we are aiming to make a mobile compatible 3D reverse tower defence game. The player is a captain of their pirate ship that is raiding coastal villages, trying to get past all the defensive turrets and reach the plunder at the end! Our game will feature a voxel artstyle and will utilise custom sounds and assets to give the player the best feedback and experience possible. Ship it! Will challenge the traditional ideas of a tower defence game and have it so instead of the player setting up defences, the player is the one setting up the attack with the player taking on the role of the enemy in a standard tower defence game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T05:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/6200d9947811d1b1852d956f4e726c72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jazz", "Lankor", "JoshB47", "revenir"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
