Made over a couple of days for Mini Jam 127: Cats\u00b2\u00a0and reused assets for kittens, food, and wood floor tiles. New work for this game includes additional kitten colors, additional food, rug and grass tiles, additional sounds, and of course the entire gameplay mechanics. Used all of the required colors in the jam palette, plus a few other matching colors.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I created the art and code, and used Godot.\r\n</p>\n<p>Public domain audio from Freesound users pivou, mcroce, missozzy, mukuh, and\u00a0ienba.\r\n</p>\n<p>Free font \"quaver\" by\u00a0Nathan Scott.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T08:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec5ea0f49fade821cf6b55ef22c8becc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mellowminx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
