If they take the time to talk to each other, they could probably resolve their differences and remain friends.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no choices and only one ending.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0b98dcecba33ac576c002d139099703.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SunshineOvercast"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SunshineOvercast"], "esrb_rating": null}
