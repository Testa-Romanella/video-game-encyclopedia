You can shoot and crash your way into scoring. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>There are 2 modes:<br/></p>\n<p>Single Player mode - You can play as the Red truck or the Blue truck. Just choose which Truck you are more comfortable with. The CPU enemy is very basic but challenging enough for testing purposes.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>2 Players mode - Play locally with a friend. There's only keyboard controls for now.</p>\n<p>This is a Demo so all sorts of feedback and ideas are welcome :)<br/> <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:34:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de900a5d25c772d1c118da94b8aa81c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["uansa"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
