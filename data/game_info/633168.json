Active abilities can be used by clicking on the spirit at the top of your screen, passive abilities are always in effect.</p>\n\n<p><em>Active</em></p>\n<p>Fire - Deals minor damage to all enemies</p>\n<p>Earth - Deals major damage to a single, random enemy</p>\n<p>Water - Heals the user</p>\n<p>Dark - Deals damage to\u00a0<strong>everyone</strong></p>\n<p>Light - Deals damage to all dark creatures</p>\n\n<p><em>Passive</em></p>\n<p>Fire - Deal 10% extra damage and deal bonus damage to\u00a0<strong>Earth</strong></p>\n<p>Earth - Take 10% less damage and deal bonus damage to <strong>Water</strong></p>\n<p>Water - Heal damage at the end of your turn and deal bonus damage to <strong>Fire</strong></p>\n<p>Dark - Deal extra damage if you have taken a hit this turn and deal bonus damage to <strong>Light</strong></p>\n<p>Light - Deal extra damage if you have not taken a hit this turn and deal bonus damage to <strong>Dark</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of each battle, you will get the opportunity to increase the power or magic of a randomly pre-defined spirit, or increase your maximum health.</p>\n<p>After finishing a floor, you can choose a new door to travel through, different doors have different quirks on the following rooms in the floor, so choose carefully.</p>\n\n<p>There are more things to discover because scope creep is a lie and I have no restraint, but you should be able to pick up the rest as you go, have fun and happy dungeon diving!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T08:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f55069cb9b786c1dae79d6523076ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim David"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
