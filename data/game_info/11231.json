You get to play as one of the agile monsters that make up the Flock. Competing against the other monsters, you need to find and claim the Light Artifact.

The game will feature <strong>three</strong> distinctive maps with their own tactics and level mechanics.<br/><br/>As the Carrier you need to fend off the Flock by shining your light upon them as they are attempting to gain the Artifact for themselves! The Flock are vulnerable to the Artifact's light, but <strong>turn to stone when they stand still</strong>; rendering them <strong>immune</strong> to the power of the Artifact.<br/><br/>When you are one of the Flock you must use your increased movability to find the wandering Carrier. <strong>Stalk it, frighten it, and pounce</strong> when the moment is right.Population<br/>Unfortunately the game didn't do well enough for the population to decrease in any way worth mentioning.

Well.. it became the first thing; we went down. <br/><br/>Please read our FAQ regarding the population to learn more about what it was that we were trying to do.<br/><br/>Join THIS STEAM GROUP if you want to find new players to play with.
