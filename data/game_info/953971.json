{"id": 953971, "slug": "oxygen-2", "name": "Oxygen", "name_original": "Oxygen", "description": "<h3>STORY</h3>A natural disaster hit us and brought humanity to the verge of extinction. Only a few survived because of \"Large Igneous Provinces\", these are volcanoes that don't explode but huge cracks open in the Earth's crust and lava just starts bubbling out, oozing across the landscape, releasing tons of toxic gases. The most dangerous thing about an igneous province is that it can keep up the oozing for centuries. With the wind effect, these gases spread all over the world and changed the atmospheric composition. One of these toxic magmatic gases reduced the oxygen level in the air. Sadly, there\u2019s only little oxygen left in the world. Before it's too late for humanity, the Oxygen Center is invented. It generates oxygen by electrolysis of underground water, and the required electricity is generated by using coal but you should be slowly moving away from coal towards sustainable sources of energy. This is the only hope for us...<br/> <br/><h3>BUILD, MANAGE, and RESEARCH</h3>The world has changed. Start a new civilization for all survivors around the globe. Fulfill your people's basic needs with a nice living place, steady water and food supplies.
