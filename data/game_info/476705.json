Not much is in it yet, but over time expect it to grow. Right now you can explore the randomly generated floors, and collect keys and other loot. There isn't much of a scoring system yet and progress can't be saved past sessions just yet.\u00a0 Heavily unfinished. This will be a big project and will take time, I don't know when I'll finish it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28b/28bb430fecfb3cd9e4812703747d4150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wildgamez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
