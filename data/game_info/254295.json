If the background is blue, you need to move on the blue platform. If the background is red, then you need to jump on the red platform, etc. If you pick up the blue ball, the field increases and, thus, it becomes harder and starts jumping hard. If you raise the white ball, the box decreases, while it becomes easier and starts jumping higher. The fewer attempts to complete a level, the more stars you will receive.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b1e1eacaf94187573c17e6b57c1cb6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LIONSMIN"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
