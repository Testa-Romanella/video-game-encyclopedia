And so far it seems his first week has been going well. But recently he's been acting odd, maybe it's the pressure of his celebrity status, the dust in the attic, or maybe cause his hair needs more gel.</p><p>That doesn't matter since a ghost is trying to get his body. </p><p>So can you find out what this ghost wants? Or will you submit to your fate at the hands of the unknown?</p><p>Hope you guys enjoy this remastered edition of A New Home!</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>Original:</p><p>Director- John Nelson &amp; Jarylin</p><p>Writer- John Nelson &amp; Jerylin</p><p>Artist- John Nelson</p><p>Composer- John Nelson</p><p>Programmers- John Nelson &amp; Jerylin</p><p>Software- RPG Maker VX</p><p>New Home +:</p><p>Director- John Nelson</p><p>Writer- John Nelson</p><p>Co Writer- Sawyer French</p><p>Artist- John Nelson</p><p>Composer- John Nelson</p><p>Programmers- John Nelson &amp; Sawyer French</p><p>Tester- Sawyer French</p><p>Mac Converter- Sawyer French</p><p>Software- RPG Maker MV</p><p>For the soundtrack go to here-</p><p>https://unicornhole.bandcamp.com/album/home-starri...<br/></p><p>Sawyer's Youtube channel-</p>\n<p>Original-</p><p>https://gamejolt.com/games/a-new-home-starring-mar...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d7025631f661cf2c2eb6e0dd390cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sight21"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
