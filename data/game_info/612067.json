You know nothing about these technologies, but you do know you have to kill everything on board. Scorched Earth.</p>\n<p>Accompanied by only your AI-Buddy: FailSafe, who\u2019s a bit more inquisitive about the situation and wants you to scan your surroundings to learn more about these augmented mercenaries.\r\n</p>\n<p>This journey is bound to be a gruesome one. But maybe you\u2019ll learn more than your contractors wanted you to, along the way. (Or you would if the game was complete)<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project was made by a group of five for exams over a period of about 3-4 months, we hope you'll enjoy what's there.</p><p>Music credits inside the .rar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e83a6f3e7be48ffa12e37a3368359ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FailSafeWasTaken"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
