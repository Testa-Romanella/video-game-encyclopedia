At each level there is an exit, but it will be closed until you dissolve 4 slabs placed on each of the levels. The difficulty lies in the fact that you are hunted by a guard, do not fall under his light, otherwise he will notice you. You need to hide, wait, and calculate it so that it does not break you.
