I made this based on someone else's tank game I thought was really fun. While I was designing mine I ran in to a few issue that later became Line Battle. This game is going to get an over hull in the art department. Also there are more control methods than just one on all of these games. I'm going to be adding a few other sub gamemodes like king of the hill and a point collection mode. I might also make more maps for this mode. (don't hold me to that)</p>\n<p>Line Battle-</p>\n<p>This is by far my favorite of the original mini games I made. Me and my friends played this one a lot when we where in school. I've added some art to this mode and cleaned up the controls. The point to this mode is to try to cut off the other player. (like Tron) I also had one sub gamemode and it was Chaos. The point on this mode was to collect enough points to reach the goal. You could also mess with your opponent because the tails of the players don't kill you in this sub gamemode but it pushes you back. There were three different types of points. 1.Normal Green (adds 1 point) 2.Double Yellow (adds 2 point) 3.Steal Purple (takes a point from the other player and gives it to you) I plan to add more point types. There can also be obstacles that kill you in this mode. (I want to add different types of obstacles too) I have a few more sub gamemodes I would like to add to this mode but I don't want to give them away.</p>\n<p>//This info bellow will be in the game in the future!!!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W- rotate blue player | click blue button</p>\n<p>Up Arrow- rotate red player | click red button</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>Cut off the other player to score a point.</p>\n<p>Score 10 points to win.</p>\n\n<p>Ball Bouncers-</p>\n<p>I don't have much info to share about this mode because it's still just and idea. I want to game around to developing this soon. (I've already figured over a few ways I could get this to work) So I have a few ideas for this.\u00a01.You\u00a0and a few other players start on opposite sides of each other and you have to try to bounce and collect points and if you touch the other person's tail you loose a point and die (reset position). (A lot of the point type will be the same as Line Battle) If you jump through one of the sides you end up at the top of the screen at the other side and vice versa also if you jump too far you will end up having gravity pull you to the top or bottom of the screen.\u00a02.You\u00a0jump in one direction collecting points and when you hit the end your direction changes. If you hit the other players tail it will still kill you and take a point away. I might add both and give you the option to choose which to play. (I most likely will)</p>\n\n<p>Github link:\u00a0https://github.com/mark4pro/mark4pro.github.io/tree/master/MiniGameCollection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T06:04:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d4eb55199a201c60ad8e7377e067dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mark 4 Productions"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
