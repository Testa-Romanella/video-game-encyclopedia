Given the above circumstances, if the aforementioned teenagers also possess the qualities of being both abnormally confident and abnormally reckless, there is little doubt that some form of property damage is an inevitability. This game is the story of a few overly confident and unusually reckless teenagers who come into contact with some easy to pilot drones, and how long it takes for something to go horribly wrong.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you happen to be reading this paragraph before playing the actual game, firstly, thank you for doing so. Second of all, I\u2019ll warn you that the entire game is little more than a poor man\u2019s recreation of flappy bird. I wanted to do something small and quick to get back into the swing of Unity, and this is the result of that desire! Despite its obvious inspirations, I still hope you enjoy this little project. And thank you for playing either way!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T07:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb5/bb5c976318eb5d617887ca6df8e5c696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
