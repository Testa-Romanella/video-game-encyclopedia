Learning new rule sets and their unique logic.<br/>\r\n3. In case you need to take notes, there are built-in drawing tools.<br/>\r\n4. The hint system tells you where to focus on when you get stuck, while it does not simply tell the solution.<br/>\r\n5. Every level can be completed by logic. Guessing is not required.<br/>\r\n6. The puzzles are procedurally generated. We tried a few programming and game design techniques in this game. I promise it doesn't feel like any other procedural generated game before.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-05T06:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef4acd7fab7aa71f9bdf6ad217d9fd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artless Games", "Alith Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Artless Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
