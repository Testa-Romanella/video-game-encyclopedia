It's a small platformer with simple mechanics and a score system.</p>\n<p>Jump at the right moment and at the right height to avoid hazards, grab the key to open the door. The more you die, the less is your score. So be careful!\u00a0You can restart the level after you finish it, if you want to get a better score.\u00a0 The maximum score is 100</p>\n<p>I hope you find it enjoyable, and if there are any bugs I overlooked - I'm sorry, and please write it somewhere, so I know about them.</p>\n<p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>\n<p>P.S.
