The player uses their own time-travel abilities to cooperate with past versions of themselves to retrieve artifacts and put an end to the raptor\u2019s time altering hijinks. Play through a futuristic museum, working with time-clones of your past selves to obtain key-cards, open doors, solve puzzles, and ultimately retrieve each ancient artifact, all while evading the \"Chronoraptor\". <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player has the ability to rewind or fast forward time. Every time you travel backwards in time, a time-clone is created that will echo your previous actions. If you press a button and then rewind, your clone will now press that same button. This allows you to be in two places at once, enabling you to solve unique and interesting puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d830d22f69e655aa876ebb93dcca4210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio 73"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio 73"], "esrb_rating": null}
