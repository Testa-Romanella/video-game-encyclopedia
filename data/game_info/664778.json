There's no give outs here, or skipping a level just because it's \"hard\". Just a simple game, for real gamers, looking for a real challenge.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS and HINTS</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Look for the \"boxed\" area within the levels. Badges will appear in the center of them. Collecting them earn you points.\r\n</li><li>Avoid gliding too close\u00a0along the walls.\r\n</li><li>Death collision into the\u00a0enemy won't earn you points.\r\n</li><li>The enemy icon on the bottom left of the screen indicates the enemy type and the current total of the enemy\u00a0type within the maze.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/838e55e82c6e885b77f6cf72cee2bc8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackClanStudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
