With the aid of\u00a0peculiar time-reversing abilities, traverse three temporally-trapped zones while platforming through space and preventing time from collapsing on itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While jumping, time rewinds around you. Raindrops float upwards and moving platforms return to their start. Keep the timeline stable by ensuring time never moves too far forward or backwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun with this \"Rewind\" themed game jam, especially for our first game jam and first time using Monogame and Microsoft's XNA framework. This is a work-in-progress. The first zone, Limbo, was our proof of concept and the following areas are our ideas for what could be mechanics in a more completed game. Be on the lookout for secrets in the levels and game!\u00a0We look forward to what you guys think of our concept!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: If the game requires you to download .NET, please download\u00a0ASP.NET Core Runtime 3.1.6 available here.</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move - a/d or directional arrows or thumbstick on a controller</p>\n<p>Jump - space/j or\u00a0a on a controller</p>\n<p>Reset - r</p>\r\nOriginal Soundtrack:\r\n<p>Soundcloud</p>\n<p>Bandcamp<br/></p>\n<p>Although we could not finish the whole game, the soundtrack is available on Soundcloud and Bandcamp for your listening pleasure. Some bits never made it into the game (latter half of \"Eternal Terrarium\")\u00a0- check it out when you can!</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Goldey2\u00a0- Project Lead and Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>TreatyOfParis (Ian He) - Composer and\u00a0Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Jakasaurus (Jake Torres) - Programmer and Sound Designer<br/></p>\n<p>ChocolateCollie - Artist<br/></p>\n<p>RPG7777 (Ryan Garrity) - Programmer</p>\n<p>Fuego (Anthony Alvino)- Writer</p>\n<p>1100992288 (Jack Aldworth) - Level Designer</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:</p>\n<p>ChillyCheeseFryz, Steve Walter, Dylan Tanya, Yannis Fu, Richard Hoang</p>\n<p>Coding inspired by Matt Thorson of EXOK Games, some sound effects adapted from Zapsplat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cbe35b36e86646003ecd6cd1c80540e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jakasaurus", "Chilly95", "ryyanmapes", "treatyofparis", "code1100992288", "Ryan.Garrity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
