{"id": 52508, "slug": "demon-attack", "name": "Demon Attack", "name_original": "Demon Attack", "description": "<p>Demon Attack is a video game written by Rob Fulop and published by Imagic. It was originally for the Atari 2600, then ported to the Intellivision, Odyssey\u00b2, Atari 8-bit family, VIC-20, Commodore 64, PC (booter), TRS-80 and TRS-80 Color Computer. There was also a port to the TI-99/4A titled Super Demon Attack.</p>\n<p>Demon Attack is supposedly based on the 1979 arcade shooter Galaxian, though it closely resembles several waves from the 1980 arcade game Phoenix. The similarities prompted a lawsuit from Atari, who had purchased the latter's home video game rights. Imagic settled out of court, and Demon Attack became Imagic's best-selling game as of 1983.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb60364f31f2762dadfc8f4460665b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Imagic"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Imagic"], "esrb_rating": null}
