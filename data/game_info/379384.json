Move left and right to intercept the falling ice blocks, and bounce them towards the crosshairs in the construction zone. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Use W/D or left/right arrow keys to move left/right.</p>\n<p>Intercept the falling ice to bounce it towards your mouse. It will travel in a parabolic arc, reaching its height at your mouse position at the time of the bounce. (Please appreciate this, I did so much math to get this to work just right)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\n<p>Snow/Ice background assets courtesy of Kenney.nl:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-ice-world</p>\n<p>Snowman assets courtesy of Teek: https://www.deviantart.com/t3hteeks/art/Mr-Blizzard-Sprite-Sheet-193928117</p>\n<p>Eskimo assets courtesy of SuperFlomm: https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/spelunky/sheet/56423/</p>\n<p>Crosshair assets courtesy of ClipArt4Biz: https://clipart4biz.com/preview.html</p>\n<p>Ice &amp; Snow font courtesy of AARRGGHH!: https://www.fontspace.com/aarrgghh/ice-and-snow<br/></p>\n<p>\"Snowman\" song courtesy of Nintendo\u00a0(Shogo\u00a0Sakai,\u00a0MOTHER\u00a03):\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T06:15:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f480b800c8264206165a1af79443c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ViolinLloyd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
