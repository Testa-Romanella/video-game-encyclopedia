Now, you wonder,\u00a0what can you do with it? Well, obviously, make an obstacle course and test your luck by flicking to the finish line!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>This game solely use the mouse and doesn't work with touchscreens / tablets.</p>\n<p>To move the ball, you flick it by clicking on it, then aim, and lastly release to launch it. Just like a typical game of\u00a0billiards!</p>\n<p>You can use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out.</p>\n<p><strong>Stuff Used</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game written in C# with the Unity engine. Frog (and its capsule) was modelled in\u00a0Blender and it\u00a0uses the beautiful Endesga 32 colour palette as its texture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition, The platform textures are taken from\u00a0Kenney's Prototype Textures\u00a0(CC0) and the fonts used are\u00a0Nunito Fonts (OFL).</p>\n<p>No music nor sound in this game, sadly but honestly, I think that's something you would rather not have while playing this ... thing for a long time. Just play something that helps you relax.</p>\n<p><strong>End</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my entry for Mini Jam. This is actually the first time I participate in a game jam and hope to do more regularly in the future :)</p>\n<p>This game is fairly open ended, anything goes as long as you're not cheating.</p>\n<p>Lastly,\u00a0I'm sorry for those who have wasted their time trying to finish this\u00a0sadistic spawn of satan game. Post your time with screenshot for proof below.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fe81ff8b8901c27fbf7d583a1288034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Yuki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
