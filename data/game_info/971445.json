While it does not deal with the science behind pandemics, it is designed to equip you with foundational algebra skills to understand how to make informed decisions about a critical public health issue.<h3>Collaborate With Us!</h3> <br/>We\u2019re launching our beta module to collaborate with users (like you!) to gather feedback so that we can continue to iterate and make this module fun, engaging, and meaningful for all users! <br/><br/>Please leave us a review, provide feedback, or ask us any questions on our Discord. We will be refining and finalizing our module based on reviews and user feedback from this beta launch - we can\u2019t wait to hear from you! We will be releasing an update to this application later in 2021.<h3>A Mathematical Approach from the Comfort of Your Room</h3> <br/><br/><br/>Experience how a virus spreads through everyday activities and join a task force!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore virus containment strategies hands-on (literally!) and discover how math modeling can inform public policies<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Feel, touch, &amp; move to develop mathematical intuition and discover the underlying structure of exponentials<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Get fluent with graphing and equations and determine when a virus overwhelms our city\u2019s hospitals and save the city!<br/><br/>This module was developed with support from the National Science Foundation.<h3>Math Is Not Boring Anymore</h3><br/>Prisms\u2019 built-in math tools enable players to experiment, iterate, and gain fluency faster. Whether you use exponential functions every day  or don\u2019t remember what the word means, Prisms guarantees fun and intuitive learning for:<br/><br/><ul><li>High school students, to easily understand core math concepts<br/></li><li>Middle school students eager to learn advanced topics in math<br/></li><li>Parents, to refresh their algebra skills<br/></li><li>Teachers, to stay sharp and informed on new pedagogical approaches<br/></li><li>VR enthusiasts interested in educational applications </li></ul><h3>Stellar Team For Stellar Results</h3><br/>Prisms is an educational company based in New York.
