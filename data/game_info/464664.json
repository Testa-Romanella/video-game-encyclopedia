You are a businessman, you have a coffee machine, pc and no door in your room.\u00a0 On your PC\u00a0 you can trade SWEET stocks. All prices are taken from real stocks. Which ones?\u00a0<em>i'll not tell you this...\u00a0</em>But i'll tell their ingame tickers! RICE (Yup), LEDNR, MCLR, EMRCH, JNSBO, BRFAAD, COKABR, BCKR, KOEP, ROSCFE. Also, you have a limted amount of actions (trades), specifically 20. To restore them you can buy a coffee, it costs only 100$... Cheapest coffee in your life, it's on sale. Oh, and how does this game corresponds to the theme (Out of control)? One day you wake up, and prices of stocks start going at insane speeds! Stocks are out of control! It's in the title of the game! Your goal is to gain a much money in 20 minutes as you can.\u00a0i made music myself.
