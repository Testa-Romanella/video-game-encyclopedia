The objects you love the most hold the harmonies and melodies that make up the soundtrack of your life. As long as your musically-imbued objects are near, your soundtrack is complete.</p>\n<p>But things are not very harmonious at Harmony Home! One of your mischievous children has mixed up their siblings' musical objects and now everybody's soundtrack is in disarray. Return the objects to their owners to restore harmony to the home!</p>\n<p>Your mission: Locate which items are musically-imbued and figure out which room and child they belong to. The object itself provides a clue for where it belongs, but each musically-imbued object also has an audio clue.</p>\n<p>Controls: Move forward, backward, left and right using WASD or the arrow keys. Use the space bar to pick up and put down objects.</p>\n<p>Hint: Picking up a musically-imbued object will help you isolate the sound so you can better hear where the object belongs.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><strong>Artists/Animators:</strong><br/>Christian Sanchez<br/>Robert Scales<br/><strong><br/>UX Design:</strong><br/>Allana Woodley<br/>Quan Wang</p><p><strong>Musicians:<br/></strong>Andrew\u00a0Davis\u00a0(Sloopygoop)<br/>Michael\u00a0Hudak<br/>Robert Scales<br/>Du-Marc Mills</p><p><strong>Programmers:</strong><br/>Matthew Findlater<br/>Connor Hughes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d096710f2c9edb6b54f2bf9b9a90408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matthew Findlater", "Drummy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
