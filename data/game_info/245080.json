However, if there are already some circles, those ones will be deleted.<br/><br/>The goal is to create the shape shown on the background orange circles without having any spare circles. That is much harder than you think!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d770962b1acbfb7941ee512c2f1ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Amritpal Sandhu"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Amritpal Sandhu"], "esrb_rating": null}
