Right Thumbstick for rotate-step. A for uh-huh. X for whatever. Other buttons and triggers maybe for other stuff. It'll tell you or you can figure it out. It's not rocket farming.</p>\n<p><strong>There's lots of talking in this game that you can't skip. Cool, huh?\u00a0</strong>The game is mostly you listening to talking. If that's your idea of fun, you're welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>There is VR stuff. </strong>But the middle of the game, where are the game type stuff is supposed to happen-- that's the part I didn't finish. So you get a nice meaty beginning with lots of exposition, a weird and small middle, and then all of the sudden it's over and you're in a VR sandbox with a toilet. You heard me.</p>\n<p><strong>Features to be added later:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>A colloqualizer: Emits a random for-sure human colloqualism</li><li>Physics-based and absurdity-based tests that require your only operable tool: the umbrella.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Features that will not be improved:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The voice acting. You gotta problem with that!? Yeah, me too.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits / Code &amp; Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>VR Interaction Framework (Paid)<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066</p><p>PixelPlacement Surge (Tweening, State Machines; Free)<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/surge-107312</p><p>Animancer Lite (scripting animation without Unity's Animator component; Free)<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/animancer-lite-116516</p><p>Odin Inspector (Paid)<br/>https://odininspector.com/<br/></p><p>Obi Softbody (Paid)<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/obi-softbody-130029<br/></p><p>LeanPool (Free)<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/lean-pool-35666</p><p><strong>Credits / 3D Models:</strong></p><p>Yellow Umbrella</p><p>CC-BY-NonCommercial<br/>By CGV<br/>Source: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/yellow-umbrella-27b2aab832734f7fa88b675b3dca3ab2</p>\n<p>Human Brain<br/>CC-BY<br/>By Martina.Fabricci<br/>Source: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/human-brain-9ecce772dbb64d1d839c3189961f42a8</p>\n<p>Toilet:<br/>Personal Use License<br/>https://free3d.com/3d-model/toilet-v2--350915.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/473732f71b926780326eff9c769893f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beard or Die"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
