A young laboratory scientist stayed in  the laboratory at night trying to stimulate the mutation that had begun\u2026  And then it begins....\r\n </p>\n<p>The game has a simple multiplayer on WebSocket  The main game is for a bug, but another player can connect for a scientist. All instructions are in the game itself.\r\n The game consists of 2 stages:\r\n Stage 1 is a beetle escapes and collects chebureks, and a scientist  catches a beetle. It's more interesting to play with a friend than with  AI , since he is stupid : (  Stage 2 is more combative \r\n </p>\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n<p>Many thanks to my wife for helping.
