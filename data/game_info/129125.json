Both players take on the role of PongBots and must guide the ball into their goal designated by colour.</p><p>The games mechanics and theme draw on the original Pong very slightly and I wanted to try something different when it came to creating a custom controller to accompany the actual game. So the Bots centre torso is capable of twisting a full 360 degrees and the arms act as paddles to guide / deflect the ball.</p><p>Lots of content to still be added and tweaked.</p><p>Really looking for feedback on the the center torso twist mechanic there's currently two variations - </p><p>Player one has no momentum and the arms will remain in the direction the face</p><p>Player two has momentum and the arms will continue to rotate.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Player one movement - W/A/S/D  Torso twist - Q/E</p><p>Player two movement - I/J/K/L Torso twist U/O</p><p>Much Love -</p><p>Neoviper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0da/0da76d0e5f442be9c9892278229c0733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Neoviper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
