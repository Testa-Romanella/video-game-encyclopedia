You can select an object and press Z to delete it so that you can see different combinations.</p>\n<p>Press start after finishing to see the whirl in action. You can still select and manipulate rotation for each object individually.</p>\n<p>Submitted for Kenney Jam 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:26:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d27fdb642a7e17a2d3505b622dcd83b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["k0m0r381"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
