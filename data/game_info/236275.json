This game prototype is the product of me attempting to learn how to make a turn-based battle in an RPG. Since this is my first attempt making anything in Unity, it's very rough and the code is very messy! But at least it functions! :3</p>\n<p>Quick explanation:<br/>The main idea is that enemies are weak to different elements, and you can empower yourself with different elements to exploit those weaknesses. You recover energy spent on spells by attacking the enemy - bigger hits restore more energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These empowerments last a few turns and only one can be active at a time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out this demo if you did!! I don't plan on making the rest of an RPG at the moment, as I want to apply what I've learned from this on newer projects.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can see what else I'm up to on twitter - @peachhugs</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music: Facehammer from the album\u00a0Dunes At Night by Ozzed.</p>\n<p>Art: Adventurer Sprite from rvros.
