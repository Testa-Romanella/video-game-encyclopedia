We love that sheer easy-to-learn-hard-to-master attitude. The fun of playing with friends in a game where you need tactics, ammo clips, bravery and perhaps a bit of luck.<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes</strong><br/>TO4: Tactical Operations brings the game modes that we all know. Team play on every map with bombing (and/or defusing) scenario\u2019s, hostages rescue, the hacking of important assets and escaping with the whole team before the other team finds you. And most important, if you don\u2019t succeed in one of those objectives, you always have the classic Team Deathmatch.<br/><br/><strong>Playing the game</strong><br/>The game is a classic round based game. At the beginning of the (timed) round you can buy weapons, armour, and grenades with the money you have earned the round before. When you and your comrades are all geared up, you will find yourself in unique worlds where you will have an objective. Complete the objective, wipe out the entire other squad or let the round time run out. The choice is up to you. But it will reward you with stronger weapons, good map rankings and good long fights.<br/><br/><strong>Key elements</strong><br/>The movement of TO4: Tactical Operations is something unique. The game is fast, an almost arcade-like feeling in a realistic world. carrying a knife, pistol or rifle, your movement speed will not differ. Jumping, crouching, swimming, climbing ladders, you are in control of the direction you take. Gunfights you ask? Well, we do have a lot of guns in the game, and each has a unique feeling to it. You will find yourself switching between your 3 weapon inventory slots to win that 1 v 1 battle with an opposing player. Firefights take longer, you will not die instantly from only one shot. But the better your aim, the faster your opponent will go down.<br/><br/><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/>TO4: Tactical Operations development is focused on multiplayer gameplay. We love to play versus real people and not unimaginative bots or learnable AI, we have made this easy with an In-game server browser to help you find a good place to have fun with friends and other players or to find the most challenging game for your level of gameplay", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/988744e517edf523e2e45c463687bdc4.jpg", "website": "https://www.to4.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TacByte"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TacByte"], "esrb_rating": null}
