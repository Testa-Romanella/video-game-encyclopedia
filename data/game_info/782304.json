Then all levels that make it through are stitched together with checkpoints along the way.  Then choose your game mode and run for glory!  Use traps and blocks with special properties to make your level however you want, whether that's tough as nails or a satisfying parkour challenge.  Decide on a theme to really bring out the atmosphere and mood.<br/><br/>Though mostly focused on multiplayer, you can create your own levels offline in a solo level editor and share them online.  The possibilities are near endless.<h3>Cool Features-</h3><br/>Online Multiplayer<br/>Gameplay Modifiers<br/>Play and Share Custom Levels<br/>Intuitive Level editor<br/>Tons of Traps and Blocks<br/>Precise Platforming<br/>Character customization<br/>Hats, Lots Of Hats<br/>and more...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T04:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3f372171c5c6ab7515c392733def2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MacDudeDude"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MacDudeDude"], "esrb_rating": null}
