Submission is based on the theme of the year \"Out of Control\".\u00a0<br/><br/>You play as a marble that can't stop moving and the only way you can control it is giving it a direction to go by pointing the camera in the way you want it to move. Try to collect all the orbs in the level to win the game. Be careful though, you can only fall off three times.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a69485b4bacef3ed54636ee44085544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozengale"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
