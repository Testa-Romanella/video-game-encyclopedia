But beware after shooting said glass you will be surrounded by the fog of the highly hallucinogenic incense brazier floating and teleporting around the room to bring the incense levels in the room to 0. However, should anything else hit the incense burning like a giant apple then this will cause the incense levels to rise! Thus you must act fast to get the incense levels down to 0.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/0025744d531ea91987ab2ba332aa45e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sun Idol"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
