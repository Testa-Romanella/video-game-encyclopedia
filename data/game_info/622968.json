Space is tight on the tiny islands, and roads may not cross - lest the stubborn haulers run into each other!</p>\n\n<p>The core mechanic of Puzzle Pelago is simple - create new workshops by <strong>dragging from</strong> existing workshops or resources. From a forest, you can drag a lumber jack that produces logs. From a lumber jack, you can drag a saw mill that produces planks. You can even <strong>combine two goods</strong> to produce a more advanced one: combine ore and coal to produce iron, or tools and planks to produce furniture!<br/><br/>But even though the task starts simple, each island you visit will become more challenging than the previous one! Can you help rebuild them\u00a0<strong>all</strong>?</p>\n\n<ul><li>Clean, colorful graphics with juicy and responsive animations</li><li>100+ Puzzles\r\n</li><li>Easy to learn, hard to master<br/>\n</li><li>13 Different goods\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nReach Out!\r\n<p>Join the Puzzle Pelago Discord for questions, discussion, suggestions and whatever else you want to talk about!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter for latest development updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T05:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/675b6ba53c7fbd15a36d4ec5e14407dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hallgrim Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
