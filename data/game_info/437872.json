M LITTLE CREATED AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL THRUSTER CAPABLE OF MOVING ENTIRE PLANETARY BODIES, WITH THE GOAL OF ATTACHING IT TO THE MOON AND SENDING IT DEEP INTO SPACE.</em></p>\n<p><em>WHETHER FATE, OR A RARE MISCALCULATION- DR. M LITTLE ACCIDENTALLY SET OFF THE THRUSTER, LAUNCHING HIS PLANET DEEP INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM!</em></p>\n<p><em>WITH NOTHING BUT HIS WITS AND TRUSTY ASSISTANT, DR. M LITTLE MUST FIND A WAY TO MOVE THE PLANET TO A HABITABLE LOCATION.</em></p>\n<p><em>AT THE SAME TIME, DR M. LITTLE REALIZES THIS MAY HAVE PRESENTED HIM WITH AN ENTICING OPPORTUNITY HE WILL NEVER GET AGAIN\u2026</em></p>\n<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. M Little's Planet Mass Overdrive is the game I created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 38. It's heavily inspired by the Katamari series. You start as a very small planet, and attempt to get larger, while also maneuvering your way back into a habitable temperature range. The game is meant to be pretty easy, so you can experience it all on the first go!</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is welcome, and I'd love to see what sort of shapes you all make with the planets!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Move the mouse in the direction that you want to apply thrust. Click and hold to set the power. Release to launch the planet.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Using the thruster and colliding into objects kill off a chunk of your population- make sure to keep that in mind!</li><li>Don't worry about getting into the correct temperature range until you've accumulated enough mass.</li><li>There are three asteroid belts in the system that are a great source of size!</li><li>Don't approach the 'Goldilocks Zone' too quickly! If you overshoot it you'll have to try and get into position again.</li></ul>\n<p>(Can you get the secret ending?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd60eaf2635fe85caf28a00d773ab3e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Collin Lyons"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
