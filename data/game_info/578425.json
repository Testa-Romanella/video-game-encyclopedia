Use the strengths and weaknesses of your units wisely to fight through a series of cubes, and reach the final boss before you exceed the number of allowed rotations. Battle different bosses and choose between relics and new units to improve your chances to remain victorious on this cubic battlefield.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nFuture Development\r\n<p>As you can probably tell, thinks are still in motion here, and we haven't even reached our final form yet. In the very near future, starting on the day after this release, I will continue to work on the game. The core systems of the game are now working, and all future work can go into more content. This will include, but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul><li>More Units, Opponents, Bosses, Relics and Events</li><li>Choices in the overworld</li><li>Banners (factions)</li><li>Modifiers and \"Ascension\" system</li><li>Possibly Multiplayer at a later stage</li></ul>\r\nDiscord\r\n<p>If you have any suggestions, want to discuss strategy or contact me directly, please join the discord: https://discord.gg/cg9TKMaJBS<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/44593761de6e8a5cb7ff1db527302aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cahliban"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
