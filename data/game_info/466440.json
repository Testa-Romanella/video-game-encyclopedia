You play as a Digit Runner venturing into the Data Ruins to collect digits and bring them back to The Hub for points. However, wandering in the Ruins are infected programs that emit Corruption Spores. Come into contact with these and you\u2019ll start to become corrupted yourself, gradually losing control of your Runner. Upon returning to the Hub, you\u2019ll be evaluated for your Corruption Level. If it exceeds 100%, you\u2019ll be <strong>TERMINATED</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was developed as a part of the GMTK2020\u00a0Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the theme \u201c<em>Out of Control</em>\u201d was to not only have the player lose control of their character, but also to take something away that is usually taken for granted in many games: knowing if you\u2019re dead or not. Your corruption level won\u2019t be revealed until you complete the level, and the corruption you get from being exposed to the spores won\u2019t manifest itself immediately. One of the things that\u2019s so scary about living in a pandemic world is that you don\u2019t always get the luxury of knowing if your decisions were bad or not. If you do get sick, then you often don\u2019t get to know exactly what it was you did that resulted in infection. Games, on the other hand, are comforting in the sense that the consequences of your actions are immediately clear, especially when it comes to death. Touch an enemy? Get hurt. Touch too many enemies? Die. It\u2019s often frustrating to die, but the reasons for your death are typically obvious. What happens if you don\u2019t have that? What if you can only guess if you\u2019re still alive, or if you\u2019re already too far gone?\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can only known once the corruption test comes back...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:40:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b0c56d4eef7b14bdeaec3b1827759ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TimCreasman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
