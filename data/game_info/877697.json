In this way, it mirrors the conditions of the earliest editions of the game, in which you could gain levels in Elf, Dwarf, or Hobbit in the same way you could gain levels in Thief or Magic User.\u00a0<br/><br/>Has your character just been bitten by a vampire? Then you can advance in this class instead of your usual one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you just want to start as a vampire? Then this will also work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not only does this class drive you to ruthlessly thirst after the blood of the living\u00a0 to reverse your perpetual decay, it also allows you to steal the Attributes and even special qualities of those you drain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, this class also slowly gives you all the classic vampire abilties and weaknesses as you level up in it -- which you will do, because you're locked into taking at least 5 levels in it, even when your system allows multi-classing more generally. it is a curse, after all.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T16:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0dca382b7b54c25e49de2b7c7676b1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taylor Lane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
