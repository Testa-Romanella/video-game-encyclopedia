No one really knows, but he can fly, shield, breathe underwater, shrink to 1/2 his size, and\u00a0shoot lasers from his eyes. He hates the default\u00a0Emoji and loves\u00a0 McChickens.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Howard is in hell.</em></strong></p>\n<p>How did he get here? Well, you must get him out. Here's how:</p>\n<p>-Use Arrows to move (soon to have gamepad support)</p>\n<p>-shoot lasers by press/hold\u00a0space (auto-targets enemy) but be careful, shooting expends your health and you only have<em>\u00a0</em><strong><em>one life to live.</em></strong></p>\n<p>-shrink by pressing down arrows (must have collected the 'secret power-up')</p>\n<p>-shield from attacks by pressing 'Z' - uses some of your energy but it cuts down damage greatly</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Help.\u00a0 - Howard</strong></em></p>\n<p>Avoid emoji and lava. You only have one life - and shooting, shield reduce health as well. Once you run out of health it's game over, and you can't save. Replenish your health by shooting McChickens. Get the highest score and show your friends. Find the shrink item to access hidden nooks.\u00a0Find the exit to the level.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Oh yeha, it's only a demo.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>This is a prototype with no sound, music or polish - but plenty of bugs. It's the test of a new engine. There's only one level so have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/89748fb58a946131d5d59479f5224189.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LegitVidya"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
