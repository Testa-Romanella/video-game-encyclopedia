I enjoyed the artwork, the tongue-in-cheekiness, and the sense of a campy space-adventure. It's nice to have a gay-centric game, especially since most games are heavily influenced to appeal to the straight guy-gamer.</strong> - Jason<br/><br/><strong>It's a whole lot of fun, as a gay guy this is the game I've wanted to play all my life!</strong> - Brian", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-11T13:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e61ae957d0e6d67643ea314b0e726b2.jpg", "website": "http://www.um.com.au/spaceout/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Up Multimedia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Up Multimedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
