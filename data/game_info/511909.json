It is a physics based game with a ragdoll and a catapult (as the name suggests).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an extremely unfinished game. I am enjoying working on this project but it's nowhere near finished. Any comments and suggestions would be very helpful. I'm planning to continue working on it, but that may change.</p><p><strong>WEB VERSION</strong><br/></p><p>https://tobydev.itch.io/catapult-web-build</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the A and D keys to move left and right. Use the W key to jump. Use the E key to go into ragdoll mode. Use R to exit ragdoll mode. Lastly when you are near enough\u00a0to the catapult, the spacebar will set it off. At any time escape will bring up the pause menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The music in the main scene is Battle Theme A by Cynic Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/7454ba3984c7f41adc00092afc885389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["TobyDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
