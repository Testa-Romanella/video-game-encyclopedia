You are a WITCH, and you find your perspective compacted to the size of a small, relatively niche handheld! <br/></p>\n\n<p>This is Atop the Witch's Tower WS, a port of the short, lovely ZZT game  by John Thyer to the WonderSwan and WonderSwan Color. It also serves as a proof of concept for running ZZT games on the\u00a0WonderSwan in general,\u00a0as\u00a0well as\u00a0for the\u00a0upcoming toolchain I'm working on.\r\n    </p>\n<p>This project wouldn't have been possible without the efforts of Dox, trap15, FluBBa, Godzil, GuyPerfect, Near, and many others who helped figure out the WonderSwan's mysteries; as well as developers who maintain important components of the toolchain, most notably TK Chia. Thank you! I would also like to thank jix and Tharo for the support and trust placed in me.<br/></p>\n<p>In addition, I'd like to personally thank the modern ZZT community  for being awesome as always.<br/></p>\n<p>This is only the beginning of what can be done with the WonderSwan - stay tuned, or find out what's already being done!</p>\n<p>Previously:</p>\n<ul><li>Atop The Witch's Tower GB</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:42:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/5699bc248c84cd131080326a7098e8db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["asie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
