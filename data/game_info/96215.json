However, to make it outside she'll have to pass through all the dangerous areas of the facility, fight hostile genetic experiments, and defeat the ones who've held her captive.</p>\n<p>Though, having been trapped and experimented on for years, she'll use the full extent of her abilities and stealth skills to make it out in one piece.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Geneticognito?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Geneticognito is a 2D platformer, with both combat and stealth mechanics. Levels consist of hazards that can either damage Rane or detect her. If Rane is detected, security robots will appear through doors, and the exit door to the level locks itself. Rane may fight the security robots and shoot them down, but unlimited amounts of robots will continue spawning while in Alert. So stealth is important!</p>\n\n<p>Do you like this game?
