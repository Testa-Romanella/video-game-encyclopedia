At first this is easy, but as you progress locked tiles that can't be moved appear. If you don't keep the number of locked tiles under control, progress will become impossible and it'll be game over! Luckily you also have at your disposal special power-squares that can shatter all surrounding tiles, or all tiles of the same color.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>\u2605 Three gameplay modes:<br/><br/>\u2022 In classic mode, shift rows and columns to eliminate groups of 4 or more of the same color. The challenge comes from locked tiles that can't be moved. Too many of these and you won't be able to make any progress, at which point it's game over. Utilise special power-squares to  boost your score and keep the number of locked tiles under control.<br/><br/>\u2022 In puzzle mode you start with a randomised grid that must be rearranged to match a given pattern. Nine distinct puzzles are provided, some trickier than others.<br/><br/>\u2022 Endless mode is a more meditative version of classic mode, where the number of locked tiles is limited so the game is guaranteed to end only when you want it to.<br/><br/>\u2605 Energetic, procedurally arranged music is different every time you play.<br/><br/>\u2605 Game Center leaderboards, so you can compete with your friends.<br/><br/>\u2605 Universal app with hi-res graphics on iPad and Retina Display devices.<br/><br/>\u2605 Lots of gratuitous explosions!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/019e127dbf1281c64dec9cdbb8c375ce.jpg", "website": "http://muandheyo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ian MacLarty"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ian MacLarty"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
