If you sucked balls in the boss fight, and you find out you haven't died even with 0 hp, don't be surprised...</p>\n<p>I NEVER ADDED DEATH (lol), so that the difficulty can be tested I want the fight to last until the end. If you happen to find things way too easy or hard, tell me, because I am convinced the game is imbalanced, for I have had no time to balance things.</p>\n<p>2. There's a bug at the very end of the boss fight which I don't have enough time to fix, but it affects nothing. Just restart the game if you want to replay it. And try hard mode by pressing ; before the fight starts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. In any case, I'll add the boss fight music later, but once I actually have the guts and willpower to finish it.</p>\n<p>4. Sound Effects from random sound effect websites (and cursed hollow knight ones).\u00a0All other assets by me. No free or paid assets used otherwise, other than the time I\u00a0paid to make this game if that counts (lol).</p>\n<p>5. kirbioifyouseethisplsfollowmeontwitter.mp3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T11:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/5503bd8507deecd447f8e896076da861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Research And Development Club - CU"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
