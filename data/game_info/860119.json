But every 10 seconds they turn off, because there is not enough energy in their batteries all the time. Each robot is designed for its own purposes: a warrior is stupid, he can only hit with his hand, an archer is fast and can shoot, a magician can drag objects to locations and disabled robots, and a necromancer can resurrect fallen comrades.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T11:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979e1909ac1a12b7c7476e9da19561cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Govoroha", "IBWSI"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
