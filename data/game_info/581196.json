Creative Adventure!</h3>In the year 20XX, the age of singularity has come.<br/>Doctor, athlete, architect, lawyer, clerk, waiter/waitress, cook, mechanic, construction worker, farmer, and many other jobs have been replaced by A.I. and robots.<br/>Human beings are freed from labor, and it seemed that the world had become more peaceful...<br/>However, some of the dominant human beings started world domination, and WW3 has been broken out.<br/>With the use of nuclear weapons, biological weapons, autonomous weapons in WW3, human beings became extinct from the Earth...<br/>Only non-dangerous robot beings have survived on the Earth.<br/><br/>After human extinction, Earth restoration A.I. system \"TENSEI-chan\" has made an island.<br/>TENSEI-chan called the survived robots to start a new civilization.<br/>You have been reincarnated into a robot!<br/>Craft and adventure, to restore the civilization annihilated by the sins of human beings. Create the future!<h3>Be a Real robot!</h3><br/>You can experience various robots in research. We are using 3DCAD blueprint data in some of our robots. <br/>You can also change the view from a third-person view to a robot vision(first-person view).<br/>Fly the skies as a drone, and go through the narrow path as a small robot.<br/>Some robots are manufactured and they have participated in robot competitions such as RoboCup.<br/><strong>3DCAD</strong><br/><br/><strong>Manifactured</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mold of the robot</strong><br/><br/><br/>Because we are using 3DCAD data of a real robot, you can look at the internal mechanical design.<br/><h3>Upload your own robot</h3><br/>You can upload your designed 3D blueprints &amp; 3D model in this game.<br/>Designing your own robot can change the game's difficulty. <br/>You can use the 3D CAD&amp;models upload functionality in the MOD mode.<h3>Program your robots!</h3>FutureKreate is originally developed for robotics researchers.<br/>You can use the industrial standard robotics platform ROS to program robots inside the FutureKreate simulator.<br/>Develop an Artificial Intelligence inside the simulator!<br/>You can use ROS connection in the MOD mode.<br/><h3>Characters</h3><h3>Happy Mini 2017</h3><strong>Real Robot(manufactured in research)</strong><br/><br/>Happy Mini is a real Home Support Robot designed by Kensei Demura, by the collaborative research of D.K.T. ltd with Kanazawa Institutes of Technology Demura Robotics Lab. The robot arm was designed by ROBOTIS, OpenMANIPULATOR-X. She is designed to be a younger sister. Happy Mini has participated in a robot competition RoboCup@home 2017. She can read picture books emotionally with the technology of AI/Deep Learning.<h3>Happy Mini GAP</h3><strong>Real Robot(In design phase)</strong><br/><br/>Happy Mini GAP is a real Home Support Robot in development. It was designed by several women designers in the Girls Art Project. <br/>She is designed to be a mother.
