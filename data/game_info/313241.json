It went almost viral. Hope people understand is a joke,\u00a0 a single person can't make that huge project.\u00a0 That deserve a bigger and serious team.</p>\n<p>You can download and play the level on Windows, it just walk around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Future of this demo:</p>\n<p>\u00a0I'll try to add more sounds and interactivity, maybe some weapons. I was thinking about designing a relaxing and quiet waiting place.\u00a0 So you can go there and fee like you are Gordon Freeman waiting\u00a0for Half Life 3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c431a9878f73237ad253aa0d719ed62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["piXelicidio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
