Topic was ,,Forbidden tomes of Pyromancy\". That is no mistake in ,,Pyromancy\", because PYRA means potato, and Poznan is famous of potatoes. \u00a0Anyway, to play this game, controller is required. As You can see on the images, we made our own. It is just cover on keyboard, where big buton is on the ,,asdf\", smaller on ,,l;'\" and this little is on the \"+\". To push them You must throw it by potato. Then our wizards can spell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fe8d6ef1aae23d3cba670d63d51697d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1Zgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
