The 3D objects that are created will be eliminated from the world within 3 seconds unless a toggle called Timed Destroy is turned off. There is also a Destroy All button that destroys all remaining game objects. It will collect and show the users mouse position on an X and Y axis within the world. The user will be able to change the type of 3D object that appears using a left click within a dropdown menu and also change the color with RGB sliders. The itch.io link is provided below along with the user flow diagrams of my project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af79e87edb244458225e9432d06e8469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Derek VanCaneghem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
