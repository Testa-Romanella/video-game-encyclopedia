Player 1 sees from the camera of Player 2 and vice versa. Together, you need to find the broken gears of the perspective machine and put them together in order to fix it. Be sure to stay healthy in this desert environment by getting in the water often enough. The water zones have a noticeable cooldown timer, so you can't use the same place twice, and the two players can't heal in the same place.</p>\n<p>The game runs in two windows simultaneously. The use of two different screens on the same system is needed.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with two controllers or a controller and a keyboard.<br/></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Developers:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Iride Lombardi, Tashic</p>\n<p><strong>UI\u00a0Designer:</strong>\u00a0 Maelon</p>\n<p><strong>3D Modeling:</strong>\u00a0 Tashic, One.
