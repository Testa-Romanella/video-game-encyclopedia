All subsequent objects (excluding balloons) must be connected to a previous object.</strong></p><p>Changes in version 1.3:</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug that caused problems when a balloon was directly above whatever it was attached to.</li><li>Added indications for when the constructor is in string mode.</li><li>Added other ways of entering and exiting string mode.</li><li>Sped up RP gain.</li><li>Tied\u00a0RP gain to highest altitude reached instead of current altitude.</li><li>Changed the bird mechanics so they move upwards at a speed similar to the squirrel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2baa07473ffb9f3d0f10f864e9a46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tallshrimp"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
