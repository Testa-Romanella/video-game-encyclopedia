Players can challenge themselves with the infinite number of rounds and tracks. The game progressively gets more difficult when it comes to the number of fossil fuels the player has to take on. Using the renewable resources available, players can see how many rounds they can go to keep the fossil fuels at bay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c610337d884dc9804c8f8713c0bceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hartonojoey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
