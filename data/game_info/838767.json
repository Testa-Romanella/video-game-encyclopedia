It has a lot of elements of that game: Open world exploration, 3d dungeons,...\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0didn't get to finish the combat system though, so the RPG part of the game is kinda missing. Maybe next time.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0might add that post jam, so please let me know in the comments if you'd like to see more!<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you still enjoy.</p>\n<p>Keys:\u00a0ASWD + Space</p>\n<p>_______________</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0All graphics and programming was produced during the jam. For the music, I\u00a0used some of my old songs produced before the jam.</p>\n<p>If you like the music, check out my videos\u00a0on YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCozc4cZ5N2IyuCYbJviyw5A</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d23e0325efd31bca75f1b4cb3cc3656f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Le Hamster"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
