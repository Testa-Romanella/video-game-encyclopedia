{"id": 635442, "slug": "idle-golf-club-manager-tycoon", "name": "Idle Golf Club Manager Tycoon", "name_original": "Idle Golf Club Manager Tycoon", "description": "Will you be able to manage a whole golf club, build your golf empire and become the biggest golf tycoon in the world?!<br/><br/>Become rich as an idle golfing capitalist and build and grow your golf course from one small hole to a thriving golf club with happy members enjoying the best golf of their lives. If you like sports games, golf games or management and simulation games, then this is going to be the most enjoyable game with many updates, courses and features to come.<br/><br/>As a golf club tycoon, transform your small patch of land into a green and luscious golf course with hundreds of members playing at your prestigious golf club. Attract the best players in the world to tournaments.<br/><br/>EXPAND YOUR GOLF COURSE<br/>You start off with just one golf hole, but there are 18 holes in total to unlock as you expand your world, see your golf club grow and your golf players will love being part of your growing empire. Be a real tiger and an ambitious manager of this thriving golf club. Each hole can be upgraded with trees, bunkers, flowers and plants, better tees, ball cleaners, trash cans, lakes, rivers and more. It\u2019s up to you to manage your golf course to make it the prettiest golf club in the world.<br/><br/>GOLF BUGGIES<br/>As you manage your golf club to become a golfing millionaire, you\u2019re building a big golf course. And there\u2019s only one way to get around in style - with your own golf buggy of course! So make sure you\u2019ve got enough golf buggies for your club members as, without a buggy, you can\u2019t get on the course. Plus you can get players around quicker and you know what that means...you get richer quicker!<br/><br/>PUTTING GREEN<br/>As they say, \u201cdistance for show, putting for dough\u201d. Well here\u2019s your chance to practice your golf shots on the putting green. Can you hold your nerve and hole the putts on the golf putting green? Don\u2019t clash with your golf rivals until you\u2019ve battled your way on the putting green before you take to the golf course. You can also manage your putting green with benches, trash cans, bushes and lots of holes. In the hole!!<br/><br/>RUN TOURNAMENTS<br/>Having golf club members is great, but the way to really become a golf club tycoon is to run tournaments where you attract the best pro players from around the world. And that means you\u2019ll earn money and get rich with TV companies wanting to film the hot golfing battles and clashes on the golf course. You\u2019ll also attract fans to watch the game and so you\u2019ll need stands, restrooms, TV crews and more.<br/><br/>SPORTS LOUNGE<br/>Once you\u2019ve finished 18 holes on the golf course, you deserve to relax with your other golfing friends in the sports lounge. You can expand the number of tables and chairs you have to entertain the other golf club members. Get comfy seating but also ensure you manage your lounge properly with drinks and snacks, potted plants, TVs to watch the best golf tournaments in the world, snack machines, trophy cabinet (where you can place your golf battle trophies!), plus good speakers for the best music.<br/><br/>PRO SHOP<br/>No idle golf tycoon would miss out on the chance to make money and cash to become rich, with their own pro shop or golf shop. There are so many ways to become a capitalist millionaire in your shop. With golf clothes, golf clubs, golf bags, golf balls, videos, posters, standing displays and more. This golf pro shop is made to be managed to become a rich golf club tycoon!<br/><br/>PREMIUM UPGRADES<br/>As your members start to demand more from their golf club and golf course, you\u2019ll need to upgrade your course with things like fountains, topiary sculptures, maple trees and more. It will be worth you investing in these premium items as you\u2019ll become an even richer tycoon and attract higher-paying members. Yes!<br/><br/>LOTS MORE TO COME!<br/>We hope you enjoy playing our Idle Golf Club Tycoon game.
