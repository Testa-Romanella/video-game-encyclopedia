Introducing, MADFPSS is a First Person Action Shooter inspired and based on the Madness Combat series by Matt \"Krinkels\" Jolly. Developed on the Unity Engine, MADFPSS attempts to capture the adrenaline pumping action of Madness and put it into a game. This game was made in the last 2-3 weeks, so the quality may not be perfect, but I hope you enjoy playing this game. The WebGL solution Unity provides has unfortunately forced me to make a standalone version rather than a Web version as it has a lot of issues.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse - Move Camera</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>Right Click - Zoom/Block melee weapon</p>\n<p>1,2,3 Buttons - Switch weapons (Primary, Secondary, Melee)</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>CTRL - Crouch</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>#action\u00a0#shooter\u00a0#horror\u00a0#arcade\u00a0#fps\u00a0#firstperson\u00a0#firstpersonshooter\u00a0#madnesscombat\u00a0#madness\u00a0#survival\u00a0#endless\u00a0#campagin\u00a0#story\u00a0#cutscenes\u00a0#sheriff\u00a0#hitman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T05:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/422b0fa59268ab78cec521d377b85935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SentryTurbo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
