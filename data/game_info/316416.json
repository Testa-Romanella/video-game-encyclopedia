The player count may be increased but the game needs to be stress tested first, and the current map isn't set-up well for 20+ bots.</p>\n<p>Join the Discord here:<br/>https://discord.gg/5v6Tj7b</p>\n\n<p>The game is in a very early, pre-alpha state so expect plenty of bugs. Make sure you are set to the same region if trying to play with a friend, and have bots enabled when hosting a server if you're trying to play solo.</p>\n<p>Animations and sounds are placeholder.</p>\n<p><strong>Game modes:</strong></p>\n<p>- Deathmatch<br/>- Team Deathmatch<br/>- Gunslinger (Every kill switches out your weapon in a set order.
