Avoid the bombs!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\tThis game is inspired by the Star Kirby: Amazing Mirror from Nintendo on the GBA platform. My intention in making this game is to reproduce my favorite game in my childhood and experience it from the perspective of a producer. The game character, scenes, soundtracks, and props in the Mirror Adventure imitate the game elements in the original game. The gameplay controls Kirby to push the star blocks, avoid bombs, and collect stars and foods.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T11:30:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c88305ee556247d96a2f8453a28e251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kylexiao"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
