But unlike those before you, you have been equipped with a special tool: <strong><em>The Photogrammetry Suit</em></strong>. This high-tech device allows you to \"take a photo\" of the ground beneath you, and seamlessly apply it to yourself like a gecko's camouflage.</p>\n<p>Previous adventures tell that after being caught by the Spectres, they simply awake at the Isle's entrance, the call of the MacGuffin continuing to tease them. They try again and again, but it's the same thing every time. Back at the entrance, not a scratch, only the hope of trying once more. Only for it to repeat again.</p>\n<p>Because of this, engagement is simply not an option. These spectres do not follow traditional laws of nature, so any physical interaction with them will simply draw attention to yourself and send you right back to the entrance. No, instead, you must go completely unnoticed. You must be as a ghost, nay,\u00a0<strong><em>a Phantom.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>The version marked as (UPDATED) fixes a bug that made the camouflage system behave in an unexpected way, but makes no other changes to the original project submitted to the jam.</p>\n<p>For the sake of completeness however, the original file (marked (ORIGINAL)) is still available for download, but I recommend playing the updated version for the intended experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/758310b3df8eef774100e667223e32ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pefeper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
