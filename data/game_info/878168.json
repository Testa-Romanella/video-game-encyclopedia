If you liked Path of Exile item crafting, Dofus forgemagie, this game is for you !<br/><br/>This game is all about crafting your unique RPG build. We've taken all the fluff out, and focused on the Item Crafting elements, so all your brain can be focused on min-maxing and theorycrafting. No more tedious farming, the roguelike format allows for a faster gameplay loop. More reward, faster, but... Should you lose, and you will have to start anew. Great! Another reason to try another build anyway.<br/><br/>Discord\u00a0 (feedback/bug reports/discussions) :\u00a0\u00a0https://discord.gg/Yj6HT6q2a2<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T06:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d03/d03bdbeec812110ee42838a8b14391ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["flotos"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
