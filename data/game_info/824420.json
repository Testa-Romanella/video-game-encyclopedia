Though at the same time, there's very little \"content\", so you won't be out much either.</p>\n<p>If you do though, the WSAD and SPACE keys are used to control the entirety of the game. It's likely pretty janky and a bit of a buggy mess lmao</p>\n<p>\u00a0Any feedback is obviously really appreciated,\u00a0 I'm a relatively new to game development as of right now and I don't expect anything to be great, so do feel free to give me\u00a0your thoughts!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T14:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d21a55629346fef592c8fd47246ece93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShayDa"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
