The creature that you play as is weak, small and seeks isolation. Being hunted by a monster that it encounters you must avoid it, but as the creature was born into darkness, it is able to shadow to crawl and move swiftly past danger. Progress through the world and find a dark and hidden place.</p>\n<p>In a metaphorical sense The creature represents us and our subconscious need to avoid the things that scare us. Rather than facing it head on we chose to hide behind something which is represented by the mask you get. Only when it is shattered we realize that there\u2019s nowhere left to hide behind, and so the choice is made to either to face the fear or to let it consume you.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Key features:</p>\n<p>-You can pause the game by pressing the escape button, it is also where you can find the controls or adjust the brightness.</p>\n<p>-There are two endings.</p>\n<p>-Press down arrow key while shadow is out to immediately stop it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/547/547c56396d54608334043d388cf236bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Three_dots"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
