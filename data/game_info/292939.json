You can build up tiles with different buildings, go to the production of wheat, wood, stone or faith. Or create a balanced option. One option will be good for later abdication and getting gold, the other for hero leveling, the third, for example, for a quick restart, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can choose the pantheon (from several options - in a sense, how the pantheon is selected in Civilization 5), and then choose religion and god. Each pantheon has its own effect, and each god has 3 perks, and every perk has its own effect also. In addition, for the gods, you can choose religious servants. There is a lot of combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can build an academy and hire a hero. Hero fights for tiles. You can choose a hero class. And before each fight, you can choose a weapon, shield and helmet. Again, many options.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game gradually opens new content, new strategies of the game appear from it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd since idle games involve restarts, you can restart for profit and at the same time try a different combination and strategy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-17T13:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79bd8ed02fbd0afae693848459c695d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 84, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksandr Golovkin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aleksandr Golovkin"], "esrb_rating": null}
