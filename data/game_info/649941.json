Of course its going to be buggy and full of problems but It can be fun to play! Thank you for playing!</p><p>How to play?</p><p>Gameplay is pretty simple, there are waves of zombies and they get harder and harder the more you advance, you gain money buy killing zombies and surviving waves. You can buy weapons with your money, you can pick up stuff like Ammo, HP and grenades. The game consists of 5 waves because I didn't want it to get really boring.</p><p>Controls?</p><p>Movement - WASD</p><p>Jump - Space</p><p>Throw Grenade - G</p><p>Use Heal - X</p><p>Change weapons - Numbers 1 to 9</p><p>Interact - E</p><p>ESC - Pause menu</p><p>Thank you for playing this game!
