Since it is the first normal game I've ever made, it is inevitable in the Item performance is not satisfactory, but I have the confidence to make it better and better!<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the features of it:<br/>-Casual click + on-hook: Rhythm is not fast, simply click on your mouse to eliminate the enemies or hunting animals, which can bring you the basic income. When you close the game, the resources will still be calculated, and you can get them once you open the game again. So for those items which aren't affordable now can be affordable sooner or later!~<br/><br/>-City construction: This is not a large space, this set for only six kinds of buildings, but each has its unique role, and the upgrade can also bring more improvement. For example: hunter's house will automatically generate a hunter and help you to hunt nearby animals, while the tower will automatically attack the nearby enemies. But the castle is the key building of your city, it is your duty to guard it.<br/><br/>-Armies and Challenges: There are always enemy invasions, and you can take the initiative to 'look for the stimulus', accept the challenge will unlock more enemies, while allowing you to obtain a large amount of revenue resources. Building an army to defend against enemy forces is usually quicker than clicking, and of course you can also assign a friendly garrison or ally army support by upgrading specific insights.<br/><br/>-Glory and Insights: The insight tree is something like a 'tech tree', glory is the point of science and technology needed to upgrade. Numerous insights bring great improvements in livelihood, economy and military, and you can gain glory by wiping out enemies or participating in challenges.<br/><br/><br/>So you should understand that, this 'small' game actually blending my 'big' ambitions. But to be honest, the effect is far worse, but I believe that as long as you have the power to support me, MCG will become better ~<br/><br/><br/>Welcome you for your support (or not support) , let me know at any time ~ kira \u2606</p><p>-------------------------------------------NEW FEATURES-------------------------------------------</p><p>v1.3.2.2(TEST)</p><p>-4 more armies and 3 more hostile units<br/>-ally guard system and ally reinforement system<br/>-2 more chest types and 5 more chest reward types<br/>-rebalanced resource income from hunters houses and farms<br/>-reduced cost for most buildings<br/>-6 more challenges.unlock units ,enemies and rewards rebuilt.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/092be7528ebeb0528f173d252941535d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wzspdw"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
