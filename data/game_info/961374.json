Until the fire. The collection is ruined, and the last Librarian is gone. Only one with your unique talents can rebuild the library.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBOOK OF HOURS is an elegant, melancholy, combat-free RPG set in an occult library, from the creator of Fallen London, Sunless Sea and the double BAFTA-nominated Cultist Simulator.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the sweet peace of organising books and customising your new home, all while unpeeling centuries of history from the occult stones about you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Librarian's influence extends far beyond the walls of Hush House. It's up to you to determine how history is written.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this 20 - 40 hour game, you'll:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 ACQUIRE, RESTORE and CATALOGUE occult books, scrolls and curiosities. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 STUDY the nine Wisdoms, and conquer the nine Elements of the Soul.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 GUIDE visitors who come seeking your assistance, choosing their paths and stories.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 EXPLORE the Secret Histories and the pantheon of Hours that rules them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 RESTORE  a vast crumbling edifice built on the foundations of an ancient abbey.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u25c6 WREST your past from obscurity. Choose from nine different Legacies which determine who you are. You might be a Magnate, abandoning wealth to seek peace. Or an Archaeologist, fleeing the curse you awoke. Or perhaps your origins are more esoteric, like the Symurgist, or Twiceborn? Each playthrough offers different opportunities.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWeather Factory is a two-person dev team supported by many brilliant freelancers. BOOK OF HOURS was partially funded by the European Union's Creative Europe Programme - MEDIA. <br/>Thank you, Europe!
