Once you feel completed with your tasks you are free to leave anytime by just quitting the application.</p>\n<p><strong>Issues/bugs</strong></p>\n<p>Left Hand Controller:</p>\n<p>-is for walking so when picking up objects with left hand the player won't be able to walk, always carry with the right hand only so you are able to move.</p>\n<p>-Placed objects on snapping point with left hand sometimes will glitch, so when pressing trigger on controller the snapping object flies back to your hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Avoid using teleport command as it will interfere with objects in scene and cause a disaster by flipping everything, everywhere.</p>\n<p>Right Hand Controller:</p>\n<p>-Used for turning the player head, when grabbing with right hand the continues turn disables but this shouldn't be an issue if you constantly turn with your own headset instead of the controller joystick.</p>\n<p>Other:</p>\n<p>-On terrain when dropping objects they might fall out of the map duo to an issue with the colliders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-When starting the game there is a slight chance that you will start outside of the map but it has happened rarely as of writing. If this happens, simple restart the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9093fcc3a5143e9a218ff7b4c1f6a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoodVibes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
