The gameplay is inspired in Pok\u00e9mon and Final Fantasy. It contains RNG based encounters, each encounter is randomly generated in a way that each encounter has 1 to 3 enemies to fight simultaneously and each one of these enemies will vary in 3 possible distinct mobs per area.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your team will be composed of 3 members - The first is the Protagonist, who hits hard but at one enemy at the time, the stats-neutral guy. The second is the Deuteragonist, who hits a little bit weaker than the Protagonist, but he can hit in area, but watch out! At the cost of hitting multiple enemies, he consumes way more Stamina. The third and last being the Supporter, who can heal your team and buff your stats.</p>\n<p>The playable version here stills on very pre-alpha version. A better one will be available by the end of January of 2022 with the combat system fully developed.</p>\n<p>&gt;Press Z to generate a random encounter&lt;<br/></p><p>Pixel Arts used for\u00a0Mobs and Allys in battle aren't made by me, they were made by Adam Kling for the game Duelyst, by Counterplay Games.
