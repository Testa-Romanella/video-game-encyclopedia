It is meant to be a serious story with some funny moments.\r\n</p>\n<p>Kain leads his unit through tough terrain while uncovering the truth about his leader.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lynn chases Kain as he turns against the people he serves.\r\n</p>\n<p>A story begins in the first entry in the trilogy of Stick Wars.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am no great writer and I can't do any artwork. So I decided to make a game about stick people, but with the same basic ideas for plot and gameplay. Let me know any problems you have and I will work to fix them!\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/edit/about -Patreon has the full game in the early access<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc163e7430f5a14b123195e9524f857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Jolly Elf"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
