The plan was to do a visual novel recapping some of the events of a D&amp;D campaign I'm playing in. This particular installment explains my character's backstory and introduces a few other characters. Overall it should last about 20-30 minutes.\u00a0If this is well received, I'd like to do short stories about all of the other characters. They can been seen on the <em>temporary</em> title screen.</p>\n<p>This was only my second time using Ren'py and it's my first time using it properly for what it's intended and it was a much smoother experience overall. I am still learning though so please critique and if you enjoy it let me know so I know to do more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05cc5262c751f34a877d7e9654493f65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Draite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
