But if you press the wrong button, you lose points.</p>\n<p>The number of points gained or lost is equal to the number on the button, the possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12. however, with upgrades from the shop, you can increase the value and decrease the number of lost points.</p>\n<p>It may not seem that exciting at first, but trust me, you will be busy longer than intended.</p>\n\r\nshowboat image by Harshlight:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/harshlight/4242431367", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T07:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e6d932a50d761092a9048b6fe6ebb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retinoid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
