See if you can find all of them! <br/>\r\n-\"Yohoo\" is styled after Europe, and \"Wahoo\" is styled after Japan. Both names come from Japanese. European-style = Yofuu (\u6d0b\u98a8)/Japanese-style = Wafuu (\u548c\u98a8). The more you know, right? <br/>\r\n-This is intended to be a light and humorous game. Don't expect any gritty realism or dark and dreary twists. Think of it as a light, fluffy snack. Like the game version of strawberry shortcake! <br/>\r\n-I'd love to make a sequel at some point, but, well... We'll see how people like this first! If enough people like it, I'll try to make the sequel a bit larger. (I'm aiming to release this nebulous next one in a year and a half, regardless.) <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBattle System: <br/>\r\n-Classic turn-based combat. <br/>\r\n-A simple but fun battle system. (Honestly, the complexities of recent RPG battle systems drive me crazy. Keep it simple, keep it fun!) <br/>\r\n-A focus on battle tempo, rather than complexity. <br/>\r\n-Only two types of equipment: sword and shield. Equipment weight affects the speed of your actions. <br/>\r\n-Three types of attack: Physical, Fire, and Ice. Every monster has a weak point! <br/>\r\n-Cast spells to damage your enemies or heal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControls:<br/>\r\nplease read a manual.<br/>\n<br/>\r\ne-mail:<br/>\r\nkujira.no.chigyo@gmail.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874ee7bf8bc49199f8522d54ac47d60b.jpg", "website": "http://tinyassociatesband.blog.fc2.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TinyAssociatesBand"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TinyAssociatesBand"], "esrb_rating": null}
