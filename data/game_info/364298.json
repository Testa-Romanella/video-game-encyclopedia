It should facilitate flexible Windows / XBox360 games development. Of course I could have taken TorqueX 2D<br/>but I wanted to get to know C# and XNA more indepth - so writing a small engine bottom up seemed reasonably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore I wanted to implement a game design that I think can be considered \"addictive\". The monthly contest of the website \"experimental<br/>gameplay project\" for June/July 2010 inspired me to do that. You find<br/>it here: http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2010/06/two-months-of-casual-addiction/<br/>Great site! (If anyone of experimental gameplay reads this: Big props to you guys! And sorry, that I could not / did not want to finish this prog in one week. In my eyes the polishing is quite important to make a game 'addictive'. Of course this game is far from being shiny. But on the other hand it\u00b4s not a *completely rough*<br/>prototype either, which I think would not be addictive at all. :-) Building upon a fairly working version of my engine, the development took 2 weeks. But only 1 week was actually spend on gameplay related content and mechanics. The other week was spend on<br/>extending the engine (mainly by fully managed XNA-native GUI elements),<br/>and on polishing this small game a little bit. I am looking forward to future challenges!) But what (if so) makes this game addictive? Mainly I think it is the<br/>same effect, that keeps player\u00b4s searching for better equipment in games<br/>like WoW, Diablo, Torchlight and similar. Everytime you beat a baddie<br/>in these games you find yourself curious what items it might drop.<br/>Most of the time the items are worthless junk. But sometimes and more<br/>important *randomly* you find items that are of high value inside of the game. It is also this 'random effect' which keeps people playing one-armed bandits and similar machines with real money. They ignore<br/>the fact that they creepingly lose money. Simply because if you win randomly, you always have the small hope that the next try will be *the* big win. Possibly this will make you play \"WonderFridge\" for<br/>hours. You always hope to get another \"NEW ITEM!!!\" and play<br/>for another \"just a few seconds\", that sum up to minutes, which sum<br/>up to ... hmmm ... let\u00b4s see, if the concept really works out. :-)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 And last, since codemachinery targets being a professional independent games developing firm, this small project serves as kind of a \"Hello World!\" for the company itself. This very first project should provide me a grip of all the implied steps to produce a positive<br/>and fun gaming experience. In the main menu of this game you find 2 options that are hopefully helpful in getting the brand of \"codemachinery\" more known. The first option works like a hardcoded link to our website. The other one prepares an e-mail ready to be send to friends to spread the word about this free fun game. These<br/>kind of menu options are commonly found in \"XBox LIVE Indie Games\",<br/>so I thought it would be a good idea to include it here in order to<br/>make us more known.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 It is left to say that especially I want to thank the artists whose music titles and sound samples I was allowed to use under diverse Creative Commons licenses.
