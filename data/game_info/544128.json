The title is a work in progress and so is everything else. I'm just looking for some folks to join me and have fun creating something stupid and entertaining. <br/></p>\n<p>My idea is you will live your life out as a broke adventurer trying to find work now that it is peace time in the land. You will do simple and dangerous things just to feed yourself. You will face demons of your own and others as you try to rise from being a nobody.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I would like it to be more interactive fiction were you choose options and make difficult choices on how \u00a0you will live in this world were they don't want you. You will meet interesting people who try to help or hurt you. It is all up to you to see how you will shape your life!</p><br/><br/><br/>If you are interested just let me know what you can do to contribute. I'm looking for some help in writing and doing backgrounds. Also I would like to voice it but I know that can be rough depending on the text amount. <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T02:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1d2c621ce34d03699b6b7a2c3980ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spiritkids"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
