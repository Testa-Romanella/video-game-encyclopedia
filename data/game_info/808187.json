He\u00a0flows with a steady pace, drifting from one part-time-job to the next. As certain as the tide rolls in and out, Riley's resigned to the ebb and flow of this routine.\u00a0<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>He's grown up with a good group of friends, but time and circumstance has brought distance between them. Ranzo works abroad on cargo ships, Billy studies north of the County, Sal has made herself busy with freelance work and Joe's settled into his cloistered\u00a0museum job.\u00a0Like the old boats\u00a0that sway in the harbour, memories of the group's better times are moored loosely, and risk drifting off for good.</em></p>\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Walking familiar paths around the town, Riley is reminded of somebody he clung to like a rock in stormy waters. Someone outside the group.\u00a0Someone he'd loved. Though after ten years apart, memories of him are painted in fading watercolour.</em></p>\n<p><em>As cool Spring air breathes life onto the land, the town prepares for it's yearly folk festival.\u00a0With Billy on break from university and Ranzo catching a ship to port, it's the perfect time for a reunion.\u00a0However, with this year's festival marking a special occasion, it may draw in more visitors than anticipated.</em></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Donations are apprecciated and will assist in the continued development of the project, but are not required to play.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This release features no explicit content, but the full project is intended for 18+ audiences.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T15:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/5924658fe6a634d2b32ca305361f672c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Choob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
