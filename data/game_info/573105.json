The player must collect nightmare seeds and flowers in order to obtain points. The game continues until the player is defeated. Try to obtain as many points as you can!<br/></p><p>There are two shadows that will lay down seeds around the map, and two more that will chase after the player more directly. Avoid being captured by these shadows.</p><p>Once the Nightmare seeds bloom into flowers, the Nightmare meter will begin to accumulate. Picking up Nightmares in either Seed or Flower form will reduce the accumulation. Once the Nightmare meter is full, it's game over!</p>Controls<ul><li>W or Up = Move Up</li><li>A or Left = Move Left</li><li>S or Down = Move Down</li><li>D or Right = Move Right</li><li>R = Reset</li></ul>Credits<ul><li>Hari Ryu - \u00a0Inspiration and protagonist! - Youtube - Twitter</li><li>Popoko - Hari art and illustration - Twitter</li><li>LuminoRay - Program and other assets - Twitter - Itch.io</li><li>Godot - Game engine version 3.2.3 - Website</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b9/0b9c38cb2639e6604ae97cb08b213c05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LuminoRay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
