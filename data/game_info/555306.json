I had many more mechanics I wanted to add, like moving platforms or enemies, or even just more puzzles, but I didn't manage to add more in a single week.</p>\n<p>The game follows all the restrictions about Palette, Resolution, Game Engine, Sound and Controls.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Made with Unreal Engine 4<br/>https://www.unrealengine.com/<br/>3D assets by Quaternius<br/>http://quaternius.com<br/>Sounds by Trix<br/>https://twitter.com/Trixelized</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/856/856170174674e24572e70c7c72b77252.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Studio Morinaiz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
