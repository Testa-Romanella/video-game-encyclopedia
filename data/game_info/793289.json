{"id": 793289, "slug": "shrine-of-cards", "name": "Shrine of Cards", "name_original": "Shrine of Cards", "description": "<p>Deep within a mystical forest, you work away on constructing a shrine in honor of your fallen loved one. Perhaps completing this task will grant them some sense of permanence within an impermanent world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, your task will not be easy. The forest and surrounding lands teem with marauders and evil spirits, and the elements themselves are against you. Fight back with your wits and spiritual abilities, and complete your shrine! <br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Shine of Cards is a game I made in about 3-4 days total for the Pursuing Pixels Jam! Here's a basic overview of the gameplay/controls:</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: mouse for everything! <strong>Left click</strong> for confirmation, <strong>right click</strong> to end your turn. You can also press \"F\" to switch between fullscreen/windowed mode!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Overview:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Each turn, you draw 5 cards from your deck, and are able to play 3 each turn</li><li>Your goal is to construct your shrine. When you collect 5 \"supplies\", a piece of the shrine is built. After building all pieces, you win the game!</li><li>After your turn ends, a random event will occur. These can be positive (ex you find 3 supplies), but are typically negative (ex spawn 3 demons)</li><li>Each round counts as a \"day.\" After 7 days, you will be offered a new card to add to your deck</li></ul>\n\n<p>That's about it! I thought I had 1 more day than I did, so the gameplay is not very balanced, and the whole thing is rough around the edges. However, I had fun making it, especially since this is my first ever deck-builder style game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attribution:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Music: Where From, by Mid Air Machine</p>\n<p>-Fonts: Skullboy and Rise, both by ChevyRay<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f4ceb36d0b21fbf3a6716c462e06c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blabberf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
