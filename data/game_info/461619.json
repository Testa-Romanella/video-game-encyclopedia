I quote it all the time and unintentionally find real world connections to old episodes at a rate that must annoy my friends.</p>\n<p>Today I quoted a line from \"The Waitress Is Getting Married\" for no reason. I\u00a0simply said, \"Little green ghouls, buddy.\" Thus, the dumb idea for this very very short game was made.</p>\n<p>And now the game exists. Hope you like the Always Sunny easter eggs and get a break from the dumpster fire that is 2020 for a couple of minutes.</p>\n<p>- Chris</p>\n<p>xoxo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T06:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c96d72609647436070e22732eaf4e0d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HonestJuiceBox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
