I'm trying to keep the scope small however, it's clear to me this game is taking a long time. So I've been thinking a lot lately about making shorted RPG Maker games as sort of intermissions from Once Upon An Adventure. Ways to get extra practice with the program, or just have some fun. 11/17/2021 I sat down late at night and spent all night making my very first attempt at that, and this is it!</p>\n<p>Yumonsters is a very basic pet raising sim all about taking care of various food based creatures. It was made in one sitting in one night by one person. So it's very bare bones, but I hope you have fun with it!</p>\n<p><strong><em>CARING FOR YOUR PET: THE BASICS -</em></strong></p>\n<p>Z: Accecpt</p>\n<p>X: Decline</p>\n<p>Arrows: Move</p>\n<p>This game also works with a gamepad or even touch screen on your phone!\u00a0It doesn't make much of a difference for something so simple, but options are best!</p><p>Be warned though, it seems as though you cannot do a backspace in the naming section when you play on your phone!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>INTERACTING WITH YOUR PET: SAY HELLO -</em></strong></p>\n<p>At the start of the game you will be given one of 5 random Yumonsters, each starting with a random emotion! Once you name your new friend, you can start interacting with them right away. Talking with them allows you to see how they're feeling, the heart lets you interact with them further, and the shop lets you spend the love you have for your pet to give them more stuff!</p>\n<p>Here's a list of all the potential pets you can meet!</p>\n<p><em>Spicodile</em> - A hotheaded crocodile that eating too fast when the food is piping hot!</p>\n<p><em>Pinapwhale</em> - A large, cute whale who loves to sing songs and whistle when it's happy!</p>\n<p><em>Kabutonion</em> - A quiet beetle that smells strongly of onions and loves to chirp!</p>\n<p><em>Blueberodent</em> - A small mouse that runs and scampers around very quickly!</p>\n<p><em>Eggplantypus </em>- A quirky platypus that goes to the beat of its own drum!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PLAYING WITH YOUR PET: HOW IT WORKS -</em></strong></p>\n<p>Based on how your pet is feeling, you can play a small game of chance with them. Fetch, Frisby, Tug of War. They're all very similar, just pick your choice and see how your pet reacts. If they react positively, you'll get love! Be careful, some emotions will cause your pet to lose love, making it harder to buy things.</p>\n<p>As a heads up, tired and quiet pets (purple icon) will be too tired to play games. But, resting with them and showing you love them even when they're not having fun can really strengthen your bond!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BUYING FOR YOUR PET: WHAT TO GET -\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>There are several items on sale at the store! Fruits and room colors to be specific! The different room colors cost 5 love, but don't actually do anything, it's just whatever makes you happy!</p>\n<p>The food, on the other hand, is more important. Each costs 1 love, and can alter your pet's emotion. Here's a handy guide on what each food item does.</p>\n<p><em>Syrapple </em>- A sugary sweet fruit that makes anyone who eats it happy!</p>\n<p><em>Pepperpino </em>- A flaming hot pepper that makes everyone who tastes it mad!</p>\n<p><em>Puckerplant </em>- A sour citrus that makes whoever licks it super excited!</p>\n<p><em>Umameat</em> - A savory slab of meat that'll put anything that eats it to sleep!</p>\n<p>Other than that, you can also spend 10 love to go on a vacation by clicking the door icon in your room! There are 4 spots you can visit at random, and each will give different results based on your pet's emotions!</p>\n\n<p>If you show your pet love and care, it'll love you back! Have fun with your brand new Yumonster!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T05:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/387747e553f5002d18dd5545a2a2255b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bahamutgreen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
