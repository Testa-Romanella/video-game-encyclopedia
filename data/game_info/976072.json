Sol sees your appearance and senses the human aura from you, he then quickly stamps Zong's Imprint on your finger. Zong's Imprint connects humans and Zong for information exchange. Only with Zong's Imprint can Zong's beings hear the voices of humans, and only with the Imprint can humans move freely in the world of Zong. Sol tells you that the current time and space is Era of Anima Gravis...</li></ul><strong>LV2 - Cliffside Tiger</strong><br/><ul><li>When Sol and you walk out of the secret passageway of Centiwell, a dangerous cliff appears in front of you. Sol tells you that this place is called \"Boreas Gorge\". Standing on the edge of the cliff, Sol notices that there is an Osteospectral Tiger nearby. He tells you to pay attention to your own safety, because the Osteospectral Tiger would attack humans from the earth...</li></ul><strong>LV3 - The Captives</strong><br/><ul><li>Sol snaps his fingers and recites the Mantra Karida, an old wooden bridge connecting the cliffs on both sides appearing in front of you. Sol tells you that this bridge is called \"Bridge of Atomos\". Those who have committed wrongs in the dimension of Zong\u2014commonly referred to as the Captives of Zong\u2014are hung by their ankles underneath the bridge, facing into the abyss below, as a stern reprimand of their egregious offenses. Even though living beings native to Zong can traverse the bridge with ease, a foreign being such as yourself will weigh it down significantly, alerting the Captives of Zong of your presence. They will flock to attack you once they become aware of you...</li></ul><strong>LV4 - Papaver Rhoeas</strong><br/><ul><li>After defeating Captives under the bridge, you arrive at the Dent Area. Surprisingly, thousands of flowers fall from the sky in an instant. The information shows that the flower in the sky is called Papaver Rhoeas. Soon, Ves appears in the glowing light of Papver Rhoeas...</li></ul><strong>LV5 - Jade Burial Suit</strong><br/><ul><li>After you break the Flower Ledge, you start taking a flower raft with Ves and Sol to traverse in the river. Suddenly, a huge crucible slowly appears in the center of Boreas Gorge. Sol looks a little surprised. He tells you that this crucible was used to make Jade Burial Suits. A Jade Burial Suit is created by stringing precious jade stones from Lake Li\u2019er with the Golden Strings from Zong's Canaries, which are then fused together with the flames of burning Papaver Rhoeas. Creating and offering Jade Suits in sacrifices is one of the highest forms of memorial ceremonies in Zong. Jade Suits can be used to honor Commanders who have perished. Depending on the circumstances of a Commander\u2019s passing, such as location or cause of death, a Jade Suit can be burned, worn, submerged, or catapulted during their memorial ceremony...</li></ul><strong>LV6 - Mount of Simian</strong><br/><ul><li>After you collect Jade Burial Suit in LV5, you approach ahead with Sol and Ves together on the flower raft. The gloomy wind in Boreas Gorge is fierce, and an ape statue appears in front of you. Simian was a Zong Commander whose true form was an ape. Known for his exceptional valor and benevolence, Simian would come to any living being or Commander\u2019s rescue if they\u2019re at risk of being harmed by vicious forces. Simian\u2019s offsprings have formed a close bond with each other; they live in harmony and leave their mortal coil in pairs. After Simian passed away, each of his offsprings retrieved a mouthful of white soil at the peak of Mount Almitas. They sculpted the soil after Simian\u2019s image on top of the mountain where Simian last appeared. The mountain was therefore named Mount Simian... </li></ul><strong><h3>Note</h3></strong><br/>To keep the proceeding storylines confidential, key features and common features will be updated as we update to a new level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T07:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c312441d45ddcbaba9981168b33d209e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Global Zong Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Beijing Uni Technologies"], "esrb_rating": null}
