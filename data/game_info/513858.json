Your control is limited to vertical inputs while the Cybloc is in a constant state of horizontal motion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cybloc will experience an electrical surge when colliding with area walls, causing Cybloc to instantly rebound. Collecting and using the reverse thrust chargers allows you to change horizontal direction on demand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To escape an area within the allotted time, you need to collect all the reverse thrust chargers avoiding all other obstacles that you encounter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Colliding with any other object will cause Cybloc to be atomised and then instantly reconstructed at the area start position.</p>\r\n9 Area's To Master\r\n<p>There are 9 area's to master with increasing difficulty.
