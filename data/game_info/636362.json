It's currently played locally on the same computer, one player using wasd and the other using arrow keys, but online support will be added in the full version, whenever that is made.</p>\n<p>There only two levels and the second doesn't quite work like I had hoped but both are playable and completable puzzles.</p>\n<p>There are probably bugs, definitely bugs, but that's kinda the joke of this game as it is highly unfinished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f55351a84a113656378dc720fb017a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mechanic Gopher"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
