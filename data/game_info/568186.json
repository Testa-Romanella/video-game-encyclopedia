This game is a submission to the Wowie Jam 3.0:\u00a0Wowie Jam 3.0 - itch.io</p>\n<p>We have used the game jam's topic \"FAILURE IS PROGRESS\" by implementing a Wraith mode when the player is hit twice, this allows the player to progress the level for 3 seconds, the player is invulnerable, can fly and pass-through walls. Hence, progressing through the level even in failure.\u00a0The player can take a total of 6 hits after which the player has failed the level.</p>\n<p>Currently only Level 1 has been developed, other levels will be released in the near future. Had to rush out this for the submission as the packaging in UE took forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Raahul:\u00a0@Raffie_game</p>\n<p>Paul:\u00a0@thecringerbreadman</p>\n<p>Aaditya:\u00a0@illumiaadi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa5d8c6a3cc18443658dc7441b6096e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raahul Sankaranarayanan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
