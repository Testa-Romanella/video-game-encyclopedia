I was riding particularly high and felt that I could try once again to get P4 done with.</p><p>The demo was created to gauge reactions from players to the mechanics, and was also a nice vertical slice of what was expected:</p><ul><li>a great adventure starring Pinkie Pie</li><li>over 20 levels spanning five specific areas within the world of Equestria</li><li>a bit of a speedrun feature that times how fast you progress through a level (collecting all the bits, then reaching the end-level flag)</li></ul>See my BronyCon adventure here, including footage of people playing the demo!  <br/><p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong><br/></p><p>Move<strong> </strong>with the <strong>left and right arrow keys</strong>! Hold either button in the direction of a wall you're close to for a wall slide!</p><p>Jump with the <strong>X button</strong>! Press the button off a wall to do a wall jump! Press twice to double jump! It's also like a start button, so use that to get through the non-game parts.</p><p>Hold the <strong>C button</strong> to run!</p><p>Press the <strong>V button</strong> during your descent to powerslam the ground! It's a bit of a secret command. :P</p><p>There are no plans to continue development at this time, but do enjoy what I was able to create!</p><p>Also, don't mind the Ouya controller buttons in the controls part - I was using that controller back in 2014 to playtest and demo the game with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a623a260f1e1753ffd18eab092079c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sylverstone Khandr + Sylver's Edge"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
