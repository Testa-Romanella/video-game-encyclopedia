Your travels have taken you to a Tavern by a Castle where, rumour has it, the entrance to the lost tomb can be found.<br/><br/>Your choice is whether to embark on this adventure alone or gather your Steam friends and explore together through the challenges posed by this game. Play with up to four friends in this team game or pit your wits and skills alone. The choice is yours, select your character, choose your team and begin.<br/><br/><strong>Treasure Tomb VR</strong> takes you through multiple levels in your quest to finding and escaping with the treasure. From the start you interact with objects in your environment looking for clues or items that can help you navigate obstacles and unlock magical artifacts on your way through to your goal. From the start, make your way to the tavern and pick up the tankard on the bar, from here the adventure unfolds. As each level is completed a new key appears on the bar saving your progress. When you need to take a break, you can start the next level using the object as a shortcut. <br/><br/>The challenge begins with unlocking the Library, finding and decoding clues to open the entrance to the catacombs. From there your journey goes deeper into the heart of the Castle and the Mountain on which it stand until, when you finally break into the Tomb, you can win the treasure and plan your escape back to the outside world.<br/><br/>Treasure Tomb VR takes the concept of an escape room and builds it into a world adventure. The paces you will visit in the game are expansive, atmospheric and deeply engaging. As with any escape, you can play alone but the game really comes to life when you take on the challenge with friends to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe89f53a9e31651ad3d5958cc745d31.jpg", "website": "https://www.TreasureTombVR.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LA12 Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LA12 Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
