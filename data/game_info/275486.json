They help you transcode your consciousness. Without them, you'll never make it!<br/>* If you must, sacrifice them to assimilate (gain health) or to self-destruct, clearing wreckage blocking the field along with your foes. Be careful though, detonations that powerful can destroy potential allies!</p>\n<p>### Controls:<br/>* WASD style movement. Arrow keys work too.<br/>* Q or Middle-mouse-button: (HEAL) Sacrifices a minion to heal you by assimilating with you.<br/>* Right-Click: (SELF-DESTRUCT) Sends a minion to mouse location to detonate. This kills all enemies and clears pre-existing debris.</p>\n<p>Meet Paladin, the last surviving human brain on Terra. Your mission has been compromised and the forces of the Veil are converging on your position. In a last ditch effort to escape with the vital information you have secured, you are attempting to uploading your consciousness off world. However, the transcoding process is lengthy with your calculations alone.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you have discovered a flaw in the coding of a small number of enemy bots, allowing you to wrest control and focus their computation power on your transcoder. Be careful though, for your enemies are overwhelming and some of these Buddy Bots may need to be sacrificed to repair your exosuit or to rain fire on your enemies. Can you hold off long enough to complete the upload, or will humanity lose their last glimmer of hope?</p>\n<p>Sacrifices must be made!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/892dafa754cd9bb4c93d62ba6084d3b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arsenallagspike"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
