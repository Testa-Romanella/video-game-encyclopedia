There is a total of 4 levels including the tutorial level. Our game mainly focuses on the player's jumping\u00a0ability -- which is constantly used to dodge deadly objects throughout the game. The levels of our game include puzzlelike\u00a0platforms that players cannot simply walk to the end on their first try. Also, it was inspired by indie games called \"Super\u00a0Meatboy\" (2010) and \"The Binding of Issac\" (2011) and it features an intense gameplay where player needs to escape from a\u00a0dangerous environment and go through deadly terrains to rescue his or her friends. The game revolves around the tragic yet\u00a0heartwarming plotline of our main character Mask Dude being in a coma (i.e. vegetative state) due to a huge car accident that\u00a0he was unfortunately involved. Originally in his real life, he did not have any friends and was a pariah for his entire life.\u00a0However, in his mind while being in a vegetative state, he was finally able to dream himself making friends by risking his\u00a0own life to save them one by one. His untold saga that never took place in his real life, unfolds here right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- 2D Platformer Game</p>\n<p>\u00a0- There is a menu on the very first scene and it has buttons like \"Start\" and \"Quit\".
