This game is based on my game called \"bdpq\" two years ago which was featured in \"Challenge Your Brain\" by App Store. <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>1. Convert the four letters \"bdpq\" to each other by sliding up, down, left, and right.<br/>2. Change all letters to the same letter with one line, for example, let them all to b.<br/>3. To bdpq is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT so we called it the God Mode.
