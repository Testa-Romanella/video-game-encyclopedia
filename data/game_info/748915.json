In the letter, she wrote about the despair that the small village in Snow's Valley had been put through. Relentless attacks from bandits have taken a big toll on the villagers and most of them  have deserted their homes. She was scared for her family's safety and requested that you should  come look for her because she wanted  to leave the valley as well. She\u00a0 mentions that only Boris has remained to protect the rest of the villagers.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, SPACE to jump, Mouse to look around. <br/></p>\n<p>The game does not contain a menu interface as of yet. When you reach the end of the story you will have to exit with Alt + F4.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is still in development and this is an early access build, so far. <br/>I hope it will be a pleasing experience. <br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Atmospheric sounds: reinsamba,\u00a0Benboncan, pcaeldries<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32b316f344bfb913db19d3e1e6a24672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haifisch_0"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
