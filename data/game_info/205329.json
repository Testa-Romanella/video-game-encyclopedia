Well, what if we used sounds and didn't visually show the selections?</p><p>I guess it can be considered 2 button, but for the sake of this, I count it as 1.</p><p>Ofcourse this requires 2 people to be at the same computer, so sorry solo players :(</p><p>It plays a sound whenever you change selection. Good luck! I always select rock. Good Ol' rock.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce3ce94a6b4a7213d0bdb6b56fd4b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haroer Hak'tak"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
