The game ends when 4 spots have gotten all the way to 9.\u00a0There are no turns, so play as fast as you can!</p>\n<p>If the computer plays where you wanted to play, you have a second chance!\u00a0If you click that spot quickly enough, your card will replace the computer's.</p>\n<p>Based on the classic card game Dutch Blitz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25cda4f4c0b904ba9bb9640d1719f3a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maymotothebone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
