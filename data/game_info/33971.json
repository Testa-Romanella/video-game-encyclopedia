In the &quot;gangsters mode&quot;, you simply have to escape the city while avoiding the cops. In the &quot;police mode&quot;, you have to control six police cars in order to prevent the gangster from escaping the city and arrest him. Those two modes give some diversity to the game although its expectancy is a little short.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8ca3bbd10ce199a45edfde7ffb4fda62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": ["Microids"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Microids"], "esrb_rating": null}
