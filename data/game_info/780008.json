So here is that very terribly programmed boss encounter nobody wanted. All the assets are handmade by myself and a classmate, which will explain the very inconsistent design. This game was rushed to reach a minimal viable product, however I\u00a0have zero ideas with this and it will probably never branch into an actual game. Main things to keep note, sometimes breaks and no controller support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T08:08:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a1768433aa5c82347a61773c891039c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SOMEwaterSHOULDhelp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
