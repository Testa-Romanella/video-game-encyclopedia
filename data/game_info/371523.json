The video is full of tricky messing around with drivers and game files, and the result is, as his author says, <em>\"oddly charming\"</em>\u00a0:-)</p>\n<p>The game jam theme being <em>\"The game is a liar\"</em>, we chose to build a fake AAA third-person survival game. The \"real\" game is in fact more like a puzzle game.</p>\r\nIS IT FOR YOU?\r\n<p>This game is mainly a joke\u00a0for computer nerds and game developers.\u00a0If you never cried trying to edit\u00a0text files, typing commands\u00a0in order to get a game to function properly, you may not find this game very amusing.</p>\n<p>But we had a lot of fun making a real puzzle game disguised as a big\u00a0AAA survival game from the year 2031!</p>\r\nIT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE\r\n<ul><li>Groundhog Day | Edge of Tomorrow</li><li>Getting Over\u00a0It with Bennett Foddy</li></ul>\r\nTOOLS\r\n<ul><li>Unity 2019.2.2f - 100% vanilla, no plugins, no external assets</li><li>VisualStudio Code</li><li>Photoshop CC,\u00a0Illustrator CC</li><li>Audacity, Beepbox.co</li><li>Cubase, Inou\u00ef Samples (Nelson is their maker!
