Homework Arena takes a memorable part of school, like being swamped by a load of homework, and turns it into an action game with a big focus on team competition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Homework Arena ended up being a double award winner, earning the <em>Best User Experience</em> and the <em>Best Technical Challenge and Innovation</em>\u00a0awards! Other nominations for Homework Arena also include: <em>Best Creativity and Theme Integration</em>, <em>Best 3Cs</em> and <em>Best Prototype</em>. Developing this game was definitely challenging, amounting to many sleepless nights, but that didn't stop our team from delivering an excellent product!</p>\r\nCredits:\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Mentors:</strong> Hugo Millet &amp; Maryse Joseph</p>\n<p><strong>Supervisors:</strong> Erwan Davisseau &amp; Simon Drouin</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer:</strong> Cl\u00e9ment Tisserand</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Programmer:</strong> William Lebel</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Programmer:</strong> Martin Johnson</p>\n<p><strong>Network Programmer:</strong> Antoine Mass\u00e9</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Artist:</strong> Jordan Dion-Duval</p>\n<p><strong>Character Artist:</strong> Jonatan Bezeau</p>\n<p><strong>Concept &amp; UI Artist:</strong> Sidney Torck</p>\n<p><strong>Environment Artist:</strong> Alex Dupuis</p>\n<p><strong>Sound designers:</strong> \u00c9tienne Lavigueur &amp; Kristian North</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T15:48:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fc/5fc42815c30109a88f95c70c617782b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WilliamLebel", "orangebender", "jordan.dionduval", "TigerTony", "Jonatan Bezeau"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
