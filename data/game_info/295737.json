You can move with the left stick and shoot with the right stick. Also you can jump by pressing the (A) button on the XBox Controller (probably works with DS4fix, too). The game is intended for multi-player which can be enabled in the pause menu (accessible with the menu button on the controller or the ESC key). The outer platforms give 1 point per coin while the inner one (which is smaller) gives 3 points. First to 42 wins!</p>\n<p>All assets I have used are either from UE4 itself (from the packaged materials and the example projects), the game jam toolkit (https://epicgames.app.box.com/v/GameJamKit) or have been created by me (sounds,\u00a0 music (with Cubase)\u00a0and the modified materials).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c758d5d780d4d254b80d6190c23fc743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mklenk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
