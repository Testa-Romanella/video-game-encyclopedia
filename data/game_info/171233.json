Your code forces \r\nyou to reach the top as there is a drone workshop that'll repair you. Or\r\n better say there should be a workshop as it was there where you were \r\nprogrammed.</p>\n<p>Your batteries won't last long enough to make it to the top but \r\nluckily you can draw power from other security drones and turrets. But \r\nbeware, they are shooting as your ID chip is gone just like the battery\r\n duration.</p>\n<p>Made in a weekend with the Godot Engine for Ludum Dare 39.<br/></p>\n<p>Ludum Dare entry</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>On PC</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> and <strong>WASD</strong> are moving the drone.</li>\n<li><strong>Space</strong> extracts energy from turrets and drones when \r\nyou\u2019re close and facing them.
