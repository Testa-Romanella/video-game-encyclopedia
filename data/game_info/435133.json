You beat the final boss!</p>\n<p>Now you need to get out of the dungeon alive. The problem is - everyone knows the only reason a curse hasn't killed<br/>your party is because your mage, Lancaster, is keeping the curse at bay.</p>\n<p>If he dies, everyone dies. All is fair in heat death.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: Move Player/Cursor (you may also use your mouse)</li><li>Enter: Action (Left-Clicking works too)</li><li>Esc: Menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>This is a turn-based RPG with some mechanics seen in games like Octopath Traveler.</p>\n<p>Offensive pressure is important. Striking your enemy's weakness will eventually stagger them, allowing you to inflict major damage!</p>\n<p>As you strike down your enemy, you will learn their weaknesses.<br/></p>\n\n<p>But be warned - the enemy knows your weakness too. They will not hesitate to focus their efforts on Lancaster. Knowing when to keep attacking or fallback to heal is the difference between surviving another fight or decaying in a dead universe.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d183fb79262d8155b48a7eb9e43e58f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Synyster"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
