However, the lab where you were designed was just a little bit... chaotic. This is probably the reason why you have such an incredibly uninventive name, but the consequences don't stop there - you're also quite useless at your job. The more cubes you carry at once, the slower you get. And, as if this wasn't enough, trying to carry more than 6 cubes will kill you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/091/09164ea99991a23294ea21efdb2d6658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["a small turnip"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
