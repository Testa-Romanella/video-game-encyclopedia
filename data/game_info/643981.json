As the violence escalated, the rival factions drew upon increasingly dark and dangerous magic, unleashing terrible monsters upon the land. In the end, the would-be successors lay dead, their prize reduced to ruin.<br/><br/>With their lords gone, the surviving mages united under one banner, rebuilding the former kingdom as a magocracy. The newly formed Arcane Order drove out the monsters and conjured a protective veil around the realm. Dark magic was outlawed, and a military force called the \u201cguardians\u201d was established to protect the people from any monsters that managed to cross the veil.<br/><br/>You are guardians, elite soldiers trained by the Arcane Order. The mages have tattooed your skin with magical sigils, transforming you into a living weapon, and you have sworn an oath to defend the realm.</em>\n<p><strong>Guardians of the Shadow Frontier</strong>\u00a0is a standalone scenario for the\u00a0<strong>Tricube Tales</strong>\u00a0system and is usable as a micro-setting, but it is also a fully self-contained one-page RPG in its own right.
