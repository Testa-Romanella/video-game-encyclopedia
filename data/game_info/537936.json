Firstly to get people to test how it works and runs on different devices and secondly to get comments to improve the handling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Working with some guns. Guns currently have realistic recoil, snap to hand without need to keep gripping, automatic reload, two hand holding with stock stabilization when keeping the gun stock near body.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I think that the realism has began to be too highly used in vr games, as I personally hate it that I need to change the ammo clip and reload the guns ect. It takes the concentration away from the main thing in the game, slaying the enemies and other gameplay elements. So please comment how you like the experience with the guns and how is it running on your device!</p>\n<p>This build is compatible with Oculus Quest and Quest 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc7/cc7fb18ea652ad230f18974d4fee3c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JRissa"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
