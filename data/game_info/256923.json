Since it is fall and I made it very quickly for a game jam, the in-game graphics were inspired by the season. Some parts had to be finished faster and a bit more superficial than I would have liked, but there was simply not enough time left. It was a great experience though and I hope you'll find it enjoyable to play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e87b619cc833e3333968b869713dc5ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
