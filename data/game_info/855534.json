I had a lot of different ideas on the gameplay, and I boringly went for a farming sim.</p>\n<p>Your tractor will follow along a path. Hold down any key to stop the tractor and change the angle. Release the key to start driving in that direction.</p>\n<p>When your tractor comes to an intersection, it will rotate automatically between the two routes. Tap any key to follow the route that the tractor is facing.</p>\n<p>Drive through tools to pick them up:</p>\n<p>Plough: Ploughs grass blocks so that you can plant seeds.</p>\n<p>Watering can: Waters grass blocks. \u00a0Unneeded on rainy days! Refill by driving near the ponds (blue ovals).</p>\n<p>Planter: Plant seeds in ploughed grass blocks. Purchase seeds from the crate.</p>\n<p>Cultivator: When the seeds are fully grown, use the cultivator (it's supposed to be a claw) to pick up the plants. Drive through the shop to sell.</p>\n<p>You can purchase a selection of upgrades which range from increasing your speed to making seeds cheaper.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Icon pack: https://khushmeen.com/icons.html<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/farmhouse-7.font</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/hello-farmer.font</p>\n<p>Sailing - Telecasted (YouTube Studio)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/BenDrain/sounds/488008/ - Engine</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/milkotz/sounds/613739/ - Braking</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/dkiller2204/sounds/422971/ - Pick up</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Pogmog/sounds/393910/ - Gain money</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/voho/sounds/320485/ - Shovel</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Axlinico/sounds/577487/ - Planting</p>\n<p>\"Water, Pouring, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Zott820/sounds/568471/ - Glug</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/245645/ - Pop</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/straget/sounds/531947/ - Rain</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/bone666138/sounds/198876/ - Crash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b64/b641d3e7356d351b687f90d6cff05fd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Philip Newsham"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
