He is mocked for his difference, depressed by the darkness, unable to be himself. It is your goal as the player to naviguate this harsh world and reach happiness, greatness and fulfilment. The message here is that no matter who or where we are, we can be happy and successful, we just need to believe and act towards that goal.</p>\n<p>Have fun !
