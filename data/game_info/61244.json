Example: (\"mu r6 mr u r5 md..\")<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Wrong commands will be ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-The portal has to be reached only at 1 time (using only 1 sequence of commands)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/368c939ed709e302f9b0620bc5854755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garnudo Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garnudo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
