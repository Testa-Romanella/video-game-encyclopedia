You have to work as a team to cure the incoming patients from the infections they have contracted</strong>\u00a0<strong>in a timely and calm manor.</strong></p>\n<p>Clinical Curers is inspired by many other party games such as Overcooked, Gang Beasts, SpeedRunners and many more. This game was my final year university project which overtime I fell in love with and wanted to develop more. The core gameplay features of the game are already implemented meaning the game is already playable.</p>\n<p>The game is 80% complete and only requires code refactoring, new 3D models and sound design.\u00a0Playtesting to find bugs will be required and will be tested by the developer and backers in later stages.</p>\n<p>The game is on kickstarter:\u00a0https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wesbroom/clinical-curers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05f/05f2a434568868def45e96fd3b7d822b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathanwesbroom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
