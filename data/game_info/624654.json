The quicker you do it, the more score you earn!\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, you are not safe in your adventures! Birds and Frogs prey on spiders, and falling into water is also dangerous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collecting flies and powerups grants you additional score, and using collected powerups can give you an edge to complete some hard part of the game or just to go faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game features two tutorial levels to get you accustomed with the controls and all gameplay elements, six \"campaign\" levels which are simply pre-created levels of rising difficulty, and an \"endless\" mode, which is randomly generated on the fly. Your goal is to earn as much score as possible fast enough as to not go out of time limits.</p>\n<p>It is possible to play the same \"endless\" level multiple times by entering the level's seed used by the RNG.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Tiles and backgrounds:\u00a0Too Cube Forest, the free 2D platformer game tile set</p>\n<p>Music and sounds: mixkit.co, freesound.org, soundimage.org<br/></p>\n<p>Font used: Pineapple</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:54:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9afd6a41f53f725d4bd7ab2e07f5d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NSKuber"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
