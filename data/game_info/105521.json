Explore 10 levels in a relaxing mood to discover what the hard path of your space journey is for.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the <strong>Game Maker's Toolkit Jam</strong>. The theme was\u00a0<strong>Downwell's Dual Purpose Design</strong><strong>. </strong>It matches the theme with it's main mechanics, the floor dragging that serves everything in the game, like neutralising dangerous traps, making your character jump and building paths to the exits.</p>\n<p>The game was made using the\u00a0<strong>Monogame</strong> engine and the<strong> </strong><strong>Farseer Physics</strong> engine. Every art in the game was either made by me or is part of public domain.</p>\n<p>The music was made by <strong>Yd</strong> and is also part of public domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>'A' and 'D' to go left and right. Arrow keys also works.</p>\n<p>Left mouse click and dragging to move blue elements.</p>\n<p>'R' to restart a level.</p>\n<p>'L' to skip a level if you are unworthy of existence. It makes up the lack of saving function.</p><p>In this game, you actually don't have much control on your character, being slow and not being able to jump. But the main mecanic of moving plateforms with the mouse makes up for it.\u00a0In fact, you can become much faster and even try to find unpredicted shortcuts!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1a7ccf565bea8ed3f8128e5bbcfd411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quentin Delvallet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
