And it only means one thing, it is finally the time to compete with your fellow mosquitos in the annual\u00a0\"The Last Dead Mosquito by J28\"\u00a0 game. The goal is simple: bite stupid humans and die last. Winners of the competition get the ultimate prize... they die last.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enter - Start</p>\n<p>Arrows - Move</p>\n<p>Space (hold) - Bite</p>\n\n<p>The game was made in 3 hours (+ 15 mins trying to find out the spesific thing i wanted in a random stupid free audio manager documentation , i guess it counts as \"planning\" ??).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Stuff\u00a0 I used:</p>\n<p>Unity.</p>\n<p>Aseprite.</p>\n<p>Sound effects were randomly generated and selected by me in this cool free program:\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/</p>\n<p>All the fonts in the game come from here. I bought this pack about a year ago or so.\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/pixel-fonts-megapack-65958</p>\n<p>Audio manger scripts are these, i dont know, mb i did something wrong but half of the things i wanted from these scripts didn't work. Yeah, I used them anyways tho\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/audio-manager-cg-149123\u00a0</p>\n<p>_______________________</p>\n<p>What I learned from my first fully completed gamejam?</p>\n<p>1) If you are participating in 3-hour jam, you really (i mean really) should scope as if you are going to make a game in 20 min. I ended up dumping good 50-60% of the stuff I wanted to add to my game.</p>\n<p>2) I should code my own audio manager that i will use in my games. I spent too much time dealing with wierd and clunky free scripts from asset store.</p>\n<p>3) It is actually kinda rewarding to complete your gamejam game in time!</p>\n<p>Thanks for everybody who played, left a comment or read this far into my rambles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>i guess if you have nothing better to do, check out my music on Spotify.
