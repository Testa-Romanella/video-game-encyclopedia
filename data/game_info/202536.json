You can rotate the entire grid as well as the pieces! Pieces are generated from the middle, so try and keep that clean! If a line is formed up and down, the pieces connected will shift sideways instead of down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created with LIBGDX in 48 hours by 1 dude!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A - Move piece left</li><li>D - Move piece right</li><li>S - Drop piece faster</li><li>K - Rotate piece CCW</li><li>L - Rotate piece CW</li><li>I - Rotate grid CCW</li><li>O - Rotate grid CW</li><li>R - Restart or Retry</li></ul><p>Source code available at:</p><p>https://github.com/MrLamont-HHSS/LDJAM42</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183d1f6b7ecd93effc765af72a3f533a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KiotiKid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
