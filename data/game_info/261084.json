I initially started work on this project but I canceled it in favor of a different project called <em>Urbex</em>. After getting good reception on the original <em>Midnight Shift,</em>\u00a0it was motivation enough to restart the project. Not only did I recreate the original game but I created an all-new scenario that is even more creepy.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the remake and thanks for playing!</p>\n<ul><li>Midnight Shift</li><li>Urbex</li><li>CyberSiege VR</li></ul>\n<p>View my other works:\u00a0md-pd.weebly.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b610f43087b86ca337a2a192f024c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phantom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
