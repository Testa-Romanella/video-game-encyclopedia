Turn nearby villages and farmhouses into defensive bastions.<br/><br/>Use your artillery for long range fire support or risk placing them near the enemy to use murderous canister shot.<br/><br/>Place your cavalry on the flanks or keep them in reserve for a devastating counter attack.<br/><br/>Use your various Infantry well. The 95th and Kings German Legion Rifles can outmatch any other at long range, whereas the Guardsmen and Imperial Guard are best suited for close range gritty fighting.<br/><br/>Will you push your troops forward and seize the initiative? Or will you set up a defensive line, await reinforcements and let the enemy come to you?<br/><br/>These and many more questions you will need to ask yourself. There are many ways to win the game.<br/><br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Tap to select a unit.
