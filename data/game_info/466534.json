In few short minutes, your ship (and you along with it) will impact as a relativistic bullet.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a faint hope - you can use your hacking tablet to temporarily regain control over some systems. Use it to keep your life support running, keep your shields and repair system going so the ship doesn't fall apart, and most importantly: use available thrusters to slow it down.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You ship has two important stats: life support and hull. If any of them falls to 0%, you will lose the game. Use the life support console to replenish your life support reserves. Use the shields console to protect your ship from damage and the repair system console to fix it.</p>\n<p>You also have to slow your ship down before it hits the planet. You can do that by hacking four thruster consoles. Each thruster will slow you down as long as it is active.</p>\r\nHacking\r\n<p>When you're hacking a system, you must choose the correct command code. Each code is a combination of three symbols. You must select the proper combination and enter it to unlock the system.</p>\n<p>To find out the proper command code for hacked system, you can use your hacking skill. It will slowly unlock each symbol of the command code. You can press the hacking key to hack it faster.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMovement<strong>WASD</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nInteraction<strong>E</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nPause<strong>F1</strong>\n<p>Hacking</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHacking<strong>R</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter code<strong>E</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbort hacking<strong>Q</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nCycle symbols<strong>mouse scroll</strong> (over symbols)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTips\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The larger thrusters in the back of the ship will slow you down faster than the small ones in the front.
