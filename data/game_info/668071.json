So feel free to post a screenshot of your personal best in the comments :)<br/></p>\n<p>Note 2: all toasters that cannot fly are shit</p>\n<p>History:<br/>Toastal Warfare was a game idea I had with a few people back in November\u00a02016.<br/>However due to lack of skill, time and dedication, we never actually even prototyped it.<br/>We remembered that idea at a game jam in December 2018 and tried to tackle it with a team of 12 people, which sounded promising first but did not work out due to a lack of time (again...) and organisation.<br/>Since I wrote a full soundtrack consisting of ~12 tunes for this project, I decided in\u00a0September 2021 to at least use that music in a small arcade game with flying toasters, to bring the Toastal Warfare thing to a conclusion.<br/>And this is the outcome. Hope you have fun with it, enjoy the music :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:56:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80dc0ee4789fb3f7c930c17c7b18ae76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minor Seven"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
