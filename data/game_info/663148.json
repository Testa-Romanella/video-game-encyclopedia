Each player is either completely white or black and the background will be made of dynamically generated and changing black and white blobs.</p>\n<p>The objective is either to destroy the enemy team using throwing knives that you have to find in the world (and can pick back up if you miss), or to bring an ancient lost artifact back to your spawn. The background constantly shifts, so the player balances hiding within their respective color and hunting the enemy team or completing objectives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89aa84565e09878947f86fa3e54bf5f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alchemical Apples"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
