Knowledge of the series is mandatory to fully enjoy and understand the game.</strong></p>\n<p>This is an Umineko fanwork unlike any you've read up to this point. Taking place in an alternate world -- the extent of which I cannot share here, I'm afraid -- you take control of a woman, sifting through records of a strange database. The smell of coffee lingers in the air. The night is long.</p>\n<p>What will she find?</p>\n<p>More importantly -- what will you?<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple: all you have to do is <strong>dig</strong> for the <strong>truth</strong>. How far you dig, how much of the truth you know -- or, you believe you know -- is entirely up to you. There is no ending, just as there is no beginning. Dig until you don't want to. Theorize. Have someone else play it and exchange notes -- maybe someone's gotten a piece of information you haven't?</p>\n<p>When you're satisfied, walk away. <br/></p>\n<p>The truth is out there, just as much as it may be in here.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are playing one of the downloadable versions of the game, your progress is automatically saved at all times. <strong>If you are playing the web version, your progress will not be saved after you quit.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A huge thanks to selkie (@selkie_lynn on Twitter) for the music and art of the game!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T12:22:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a0f5ed4c221e0bfb78f8da5a331fb72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DWaM"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
