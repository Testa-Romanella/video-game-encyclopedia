My theme was Asteroids + Boxing.</p>\n\n<p>[Bugs:]</p>\n<p>It seems like i missed a bug where your lives dont get refilled when restarting, causing you to only have one life when restarting after dying. Just refresh the page to restart for now.</p>\n<p>A more major bug is that over time, only the largest type of asteroids spawn, making it impossible to create any asteroids that are better than the orange ones after about 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>[Post Jam Stuff:]</p>\n<p>I've made a fixed version for download, but i won't replace the one that's playable in-browser until after the voting ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac108a969e562c3ca9479509c4ffbdde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BlueMango"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
