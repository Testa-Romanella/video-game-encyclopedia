The level will adapt to your moves by placing down traps where you die the most, and will also lock off certain areas if you use them too often. Maneuver your way around the erratic soccer players with the help of disguises, health-kits, and your speed.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Control - Crouch</p>\n<p>Shift - Run<br/></p>\n<p>Left click - Interact, Pick up or Use Items</p>\n<p>Right click - Throw</p>\n<p>Escape - Menu<br/></p><p>F - Flashlight</p>\n<p>V - Zoom</p>\n<p>Z - Lean left</p>\n<p>C - Lean right<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game makes use of the \"Navigation Lite\" addon by Milo\u0161 Luki\u0107, which can be found on their GitHub. The audio was all taken from Freesound, eventually I'll make a proper credits page for the specific sounds I used. The textures are either from Google Images or textures I made ages ago and repurposed for this game. The blur effect was copy-pasted from _NoDev_. I forgot where I got the water shader from, but once I find out their links will be posted here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T07:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408d6350580fb3449b3ff94e041e7840.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["monkey man"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
