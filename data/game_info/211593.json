It still needs a lot of polish and there are noticeable bugs, especially in the animation. Some features, e.g. NPC behaviour when being attacked, are currently not implemented due to time limit. Some UI are quite small ... because we didn't\u00a0\u00a0scale with screen size . We didn't add music this time. The game loads a bit slow in web browser :(, we suggest you to play in full screen or download the windows version :)***<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\n<p>The game sets up in a\u00a0not-too-distant dystopian future. You are a lone wanderer, travelling through a dessert in a land destroyed by\u00a0nuclear war. You wandered into a village one day, looking for fresh water. The village was just been raided, you struck a deal with the villagers. If you help them get back the well, they will give you fresh water in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>-left click to move, right click to shoot</p>\n<p>-press E to talk to NPCs ( blue ones)</p>\n<p>- walk over items (potion, berries etc. ) to collect</p>\n<p>-right click to use inventory item.\u00a0left click to swap inventory objects,\u00a0 left click + drag item outside of inventory to delete them forever.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game! :D We appreciate any feedback you provided for this game!
