The story covers a dystopic future in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. You control Aurora, a member from a revolutionary group that has a mission to reveal the hideous secrets of a megacorporation. Aurora has a special skill that allows her to copy living and inanimate things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our game was chosen as one of the 3 best games of the game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was responsible for programming, game design and some interface and art features.</p>\n<p>Sampa 2077 was created with Unity Engine and it runs on PC.</p>\n<p>Language: Portuguese.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:24:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d443ec871daf92903445793f30c9c520.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maeda Desenvolvedor"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
