It is currently unfinished (I don't think you can actually fight the boss), but you can play through much of the level.\u00a0 I also recommend you use a gamepad/controller, as I didn't have a chance to test the keyboard/mouse controls very much:<br/><br/>Move: WASD/Left Stick<br/>Jump: Space/South Button<br/>Dash: F + Cursor/East Button + Right Stick<br/>Light Attack: LMB/West Button<br/>Heavy\u00a0Attack: RMB/North Button</p>\n<p>HoldWall: LShift/Right Trigger</p>\n<p>PS: You should only need to download the zip file!</p>\n<p>My partner and I wanted to challenge ourselves by participating in the Historically Accurate Game Jam this year, and this is the result. I've only been coding for about a year, and this is my first jam programming. We're hoping to finish the game once the jam voting is over\u00a0so that you can at least play through it. We'll be adding music and sound then as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Art - Austin Hayes<br/>Programming - Steven Scherber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4849ab25e9af4b5554a6996540cf2ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steveismeow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
