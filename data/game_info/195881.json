It is currently in a state of a free for all but I am looking into making it a more unique type of shooter game.\u00a0I have fun working on this game but seeing as how I need to make money for life things I can't work on it as much as I wish to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/208e723addaa92ab1ee2980929c95b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OmKaBo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
