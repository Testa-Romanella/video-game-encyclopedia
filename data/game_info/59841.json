For many, the only gig in town is Chiptunes, a dilapidated Opera House, run by a mysterious figure known only as \u201cThe Direction\u201d. Four Coins an hour to go on camera and run through levels built in real time by the audience, if you\u2019re lucky. If the audience is in a bad mood, it\u2019s all spikes, monsters and pits.
