Countless explorers have been lost, but now it is  your turn. Crash your probe into the moons of Abyss to earn money for  upgrades. Then, when you\u2019re ready, pilot your ship into the great  beyond.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: Your ship will automatically orient itself to  point in the direction of your cursor. Use the spacebar or right click  to fire the thrusters (be aware that you only have a limited amount of  fuel, and the central planet has a strong gravitational pull). Visiting  new bodies (by crashing into them) will generate money with which you  can purchase upgrades for your ship. Use your mouse wheel to zoom  in/out, click the middle mouse to pan, the R key to restart, and P to  pause. Mute with M. Exit with Escape.\r\n</p>\n<p>Goal: You will pilot your  ship through the system until you either leave the system or crash. It\u2019s  possible to leave the system if you reach a distance of 500u from your  starting point at a speed of 0.48 u/sec.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d7522316f603c8fd7e59d21c7d4707.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePhantomEllipsis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
