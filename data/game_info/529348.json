My favorite part of that game was the bonus round where you shot a spaceship back and forth that got increasingly smaller and further away. So here, in that grand tradition, I am happy to present you this Tombstones B-side which is stupidly named <em>Disc Donk </em>(after the sound made when the ship gets hit).</p>\n<p><em>Disc Donk </em>attempts to replicate as much of the <em>TI Invaders</em> bonus game as possible while tacking on enough extras to make it a full game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Facsimiles of the TI colors, sound effects, graphics, and gameplay</li><li>Same increasing point values as the TI version</li><li>Dramatic explosion animation and sound after the 15th hit of the saucer</li><li>Three stages per level; in each stage the saucer moves faster</li><li>Five separate levels, increasingly blockaded</li><li>Motivational messages between levels and an extra ship, too (idea and sound effect stolen vaguely from <em>Munch Man</em>)</li><li>Hypnotic title screen and game over graphics</li><li>A cornucopia of curses as you miss a three-pixel wide saucer at the top of the screen</li></ul>\n<p>Requires Stella or another Atari 2600 emulator to play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:05:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482941c0008d5a61bda15f093820b1ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bjbest60"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
