It is also a mod of rock paper scissors in a way.</p>\n<p>Everyone is trapped in the mirror and the only way out is the mutual embarrassment of performing the same dance move all at once. Players stand at a certain distance a part from one another, and all proceed towards the center and try and perform the same movement when they meet. If not, they continue to dance in the mirror by repeating the process.</p>\n\n<p>There are three movements to Dancing in the Mirror. Demonstrated below.</p>\n<p>The Jump:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NBoen8BaHA</p>\n<p>The Backstep:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMJL6Pk6LsY</p>\n<p>The Rock:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43iQD3gd04A</p>\n<p>All you need is your body, a set of people to dance with, maybe some music, and some space.
