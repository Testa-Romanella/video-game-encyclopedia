Luckily the bus absorbs some energy from shifting through objects. This seems to power the warp engine slightly longer than usual.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2573855e19c5832da9f76930009c83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spluuga"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
