One player has to host the game, while the other three players can join him through his external ip and the set port. In order for that to work, you either need to forward your ports (see\u00a0portforwarding) or use a virtual private network (like hamachi). If you play with people in the same lan, just use your internal ip address and everything will work fine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e40e814a8364e92327452e89ce8a659b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rhayn", "AlihanAt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
