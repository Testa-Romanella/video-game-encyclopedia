While my day job did an admirable job of getting in the way of my time for this project, I got it to a playable gameplay concept - you can indeed pilot a single boat through a very short canal. Tap the WASD keys to increase/decrease your throttle/rudder, it feels funky, like piloting a boat. There's lots of fun gameplay to expand on later - currents, winds, time pressure, water pressure, other ships, space aliens trying to abduct and probe your cargo containers...<br/></p>\n<p>Built with Godot 3.3.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T09:22:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be34be17f5814e4134e9568b36b714d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mysteriouspants"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
