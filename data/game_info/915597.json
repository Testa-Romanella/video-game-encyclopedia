Any time issues would arise during the development of the game, I would have to wrestle this code creature to help me understand and repair what my first asks created.<br/><br/></p>\r\n~~~Tools Used~~\r\n\n<ul><li>Unity for the Game Engine<ul><li>Visual Studio for IDE</li></ul></li><li>Blender for Model Creation<ul><li>Adobe Mixamo for Model Rigging</li></ul></li><li>Audacity for Audio editing</li><li>Dalle-2, Night-Cafe, MidJourney for image generation</li><li>ChatGPT3 for AI Assistances in code creation</li></ul>\r\n~~~Links~~\r\n<p>Documentation of Conversation with AI for building the Project:<br/>First Days of Chat\u00a0and\u00a0Later Days of Chat<br/><br/>Assets:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>c# scripts</li><li>Audio</li><li>3d Models\u00a0</li></ul>\n\r\n~~~Additional Credits~~\r\n<p>Audio:</p>\n<ul><li>Voice Over for Main Menu - The Dusted One<ul><li>all others Government Name<ul><li>CC0 2023</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects from FreeSound.org<ul><li>CC0 2023\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Original\u00a0Film:<ul><li>Archive.org</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing, enjoy the experience!<br/></p>\n\n<p>No Rights Reserved 2023</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf0bf22bab793b01ec09c023abfd4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goverment name"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
