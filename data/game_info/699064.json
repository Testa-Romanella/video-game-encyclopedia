Thanks to Drone VR, you will have the opportunity to fly drones in virtual reality - without the fear of smashing this expensive device.<br/><br/>My task was to create an application for flying drones and release it at an affordable, low price.<br/><br/><strong>8 drones to\u00a0play with!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The application has the following modes:</strong><br/><ul><li>free flying<br/></li><li>flying on time (with Steam Leaderboards)</li></ul>More mods will be added soon!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Maps:</strong><br/><ul><li>City<br/></li><li>Factory<br/></li><li>Farm<br/></li><li>Park<br/></li><li>Parking<br/></li><li>Skatepark<br/></li><li>Train Depot<br/></li><li>Warehouse</li></ul><br/>If the application will\u00a0be popular, new, new modes will be added - go ahead and write what mode you would like to be added on the community page.<br/><br/>The application is not a simulator - I tried my best to reproduce the physics of drone movement, but it is not so advanced to define the application as a simulator. Also it doesn't have many settings to adjust.<br/><br/>PLANS FOR FUTURE UPDATES:<br/><ul><li>Fixes<br/></li><li>Adding FPV Drone Controller - racing drone physics, with its own leaderboards. <br/></li><li>Suggested changes &amp; addons.</li></ul><br/><br/>I will be grateful for any feedback, comments and reviews on Steam.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Damian3k", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T03:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d74200056c7b8b7389d8f13caa6b1ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["damian3k"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["damian3k"], "esrb_rating": null}
