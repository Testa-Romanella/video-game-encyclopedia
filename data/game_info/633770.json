{"id": 633770, "slug": "doggy-disk", "name": "Doggy Disk", "name_original": "Doggy Disk", "description": "<p>Doggy Disk was developed during a 48-hour game jam held by Georgia Tech's VGDev club. The theme was \"All Around You\" so we've got cats coming at you from every direction. What's more, you must defend yourself by placing your fellow dogs on the frisbees around you. Your towers fire for you, but their range and eyesight is limited - you must take an active role in spinning the disks to put your good bois where they're needed the most, lest you perish to the cat army. Careful balance of treats, tower placement, and disk rotation is key to mastering this game. Currently, the game is endless, so just try to stay alive as long as you can!<br/><br/>Made by<br/>- Drew Busch<br/>- Andrew Hoyt<br/>-\u00a0Logan Bowers<br/>- Ian Hurrel<br/>-\u00a0Sara Inani</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55c97314a23fda3902a8a854e48f5066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chillhammer", "Jroo", "L_cpp", "ianh729"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
