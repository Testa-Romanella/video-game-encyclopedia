Guide Rogers rocket to the landing pads to drop off his friends.<br/><br/>7 levels, more to come, this has become kind of a fun pet project to mess around with different levels / challenges. Eventually would love to add a passenger pickup mechanic, music sheets to change the song, and some graphical indication of passenger drop off. <br/></p>\n<p>-Hold space for thrusters<br/>-Left / Right arrows for steering<br/>-Land on target platform to proceed<br/>-Hit Q to quit<br/></p>\n<p>Tip: Tap the thrusters combined with counter steering to hit the breaks. You only need to touch the landing pad-- not land correctly / cleanly!</p>\n<p>My main goals for this project were to create a quirky arcade / mobile style game (I know I know it's a Windows build), with an easily modifiable level editing structure. <br/></p>\n<p>*All assets are home-brewed, from Kenney's Assets, or obtained from FreeSound.org under royalty free license.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:36:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cded6f9fa92929a982e8e1389f119a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games From The Meep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
