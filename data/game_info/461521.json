It's an Asteroids clone with a few additional bits and bobs. I took on this small project in order to understand physics within the engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will be a stepping stone to larger and more elaborate projects. As I mentioned I used Godot, the C# edition. I also created all the game assets myself.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to drop me a comment or suggestion. I'm always open to feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f43/f4384265e37d301d579e651866469528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JOEY"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
