U Dead</strong> is a submission for the Mini Jam 51:Rome where you unleash your creativity in game development to create a game that matches the theme and the limitation within three days.</p>\n<p>The very first thing that pops out to mind when I heard the word Rome, is the Colosseum with gladiators and a lot of actions and fighting going around. But instead of gladiators.  Inhuman creatures are spawned by the player to stop the heroes from rescuing the villagers because keeping villagers as hostages is the most villain thing there is.</p>\n<p>\u2022  \u2022  \u2022</p>\r\n Minions \r\n\n<p>Bring the heroes to despair with these 4 unique characters currently available to the game.

There are more features and mechanics I would like to add in the future that cannot be done in this time frame. Like, more levels, more baddies to spawn, less clunky game loop, music, or other stuff.</p>\n<p>Your suggestions are welcome!</p>\n<p>This game is created for 2 whole days. Sprites and the game core on Day 1 and more sprite, more\u00a0coding, the addition of SFX, optimizing, bug fixing and balancing on Day 2, and lastly, I do some final testing and made this landing page on itch.io on Day 3</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my best buddy in terms of SFX:\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/</p>\n<p>The game is created using Game Maker Studio 1.4 didn't have a license for the 2nd version so I am sticking on the older version. Hey, it still works like a charm!</p>\n<p>I am planning to include the source code here in the future if some are interested.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50b3269ddcf8bc9012098283bbbe113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["High Leap Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
