Remade", "description": "<p>Relax and enjoy the nautical themed ambience and casually\u00a0solve some gameboards!</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is turn tiles on until the rows and columns match the hints. The hints are the numbers on along the border of the gameboard. If you see a\u00a0\"2-2\", this will mean that 2 tiles must be turned on side-by-side (consecutively), then at least 1 tile is off, and then\u00a0finally another 2 consecutive tiles on after. A tutorial mode will be coming soon to help with the learning process! Some changes (including the win SoundFX) will also be improved.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a remake of the original Toggle! puzzle\u00a0Game. The source code of the original game was lost and so this game\u00a0was created from scratch again!\u00a0Created and developed independently\u00a0by Curtis McQuarrie.
