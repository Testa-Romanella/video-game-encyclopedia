Now they are wreaking havoc in the village by hoarding a stash of neighbors stuff! It is your job to return the items stolen by Salem and Jasper, to the rightful owners! You need to navigate the village and ensure that each villager has their right item otherwise your street cred runs out and you lose! You can only carry 4 items at a time so be aware about what your carrying before trying to return! You collect by walking into an object which is then sent to your inventory, and then you return them by waking up to the owner who is missing their object and pressing spacebar! WASD and arrow keys allow you to navigate Remember that this is timed so if you cred is too low at the timer end point you lose!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:43:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a8284dc921ca84ed78699a180902a31f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VictorSimVis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
