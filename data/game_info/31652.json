Swipe your finger and watch the red and blue lasers flow outwards and race to the edges of the grid. Only a strike from one of the ricocheting red-and-white balls will prematurely end its journey. Succeed in reaching the side and the grid will be sliced in half along your lasers lines.<br/><br/>Once you clear over 75% of the grid - you win! Earn more points the faster you clear and the more of the grid you clear in your final slice.
