Maybe something will happen.</p>\n<p>-Be careful when hiring workers. You can't fire them afterwards.</p>\n<p>-There are 30 dumpsters in the map.</p>\n<p>-Sleeping will save the game.</p>\n<p>-Once you have the assistant don't collect the bottles from storage because you can sell them instantly on the computer.</p>\n<p>-Once the hunger bar hits U you die.(Will be fixed later probably)</p>\n<p>-To finish the game you must go to the bartender with 10 000$</p>\n<p>-Sleeping resets the loot in the dumpsters</p>\n<p>-You can get a job from the bank if you have the suit</p>\n<p>-Leaving the game when having a lot of workers is not recommended as you will lose all the bottles in storage(Might get fixed)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a8b61e5910d674f0e91613a0b3bbd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ERNOSTEF"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
