You control the planets military to protect it from federation invaders and rogue space leviathans.<br/><br/>A turn based game that is incredible unbalanced at the moment, don't really have time or energy to balance so try to pace yourselves for a good time. You'll want to start off by buying a unit, this costs people, science and scrap. You can earn science and people passively each round, but will earn more + scrap from killing enemies.<br/><br/>Goodluck, post your highscores xD<br/>Made solo in a 48h period but had to submit into Jam due to school.<br/>Note: Mac build currently broken</p><p>Ludum Dare 38 Submission Page<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7d008b6d063855961c8b99a0306294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spag Head Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
