Solve the puzzle to pollinate the prize flower and complete the level. There are 15 levels in total. The currently pollinated flower is highlighted in full colour. Unpollinated flowers are in grey.\u00a0 Flowers that can be pollinated are highlighted in blue.</p>\n<p>Different flowers pollinate differently:</p>\n<p>- Tulips can pollinate in a full diagonal direction.</p>\n<p>- Bluebells can pollinate in a horizontal direction.</p>\n<p>- Daffodils can pollinate in a vertical direction.</p>\n<p>- Alliums can pollinate in all directions but only within one square ranges.</p>\n<p>Remember that flowers wilt after pollinating! Be careful not to get stuck, and if you do, click the reset icon to restart the level.</p>\n<p>Developed by FennecFu Games.
