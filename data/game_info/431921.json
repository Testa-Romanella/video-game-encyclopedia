But, her head has separated from her body somehow so you'll have to slide her around so she can FEAST. Luckily some slob dropped a bunch of mcri- I mean pork-based rib sandwiches\u00a0on the floor so, be sure to eat up!<br/>It's only 1 level. Also, this was my first game in Unity and I used a tutorial so don't expect much \u03a3(;\u03a6 \u03c9 \u03a6)</p>\n<p>*Note: This was previously a download called Toiletbread- the Game, but I took that down, changed the BG in-game and made it playable on your browser so you don't have to fill your hard drive with nonsense! Thanks, Unity!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T11:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b249451e8b5d0ff5e51c63b5da1afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pikel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
