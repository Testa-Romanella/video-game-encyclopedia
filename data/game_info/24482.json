They accomplish this amazing feat by oscillating the long \n      flagellum that extends from their head. By resonating the vibration with \n      their water-droplet-shaped body, the plankton produce sounds that \n      closely resemble the human voice. The body can expand and contract at \n      will. By changing shape, they can easily manipulate the sound of the \n      voice. Words that the Varvoice memorize and play back in reverse have a \n      particularly strange ring to them. Researchers refer to this phenonmenon \n      as Varvoice inversion.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c343ed1ae864523184e14c28c5e46251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
