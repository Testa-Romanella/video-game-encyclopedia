Sit down, either by yourself or with friends and family, to enjoy a calm, turn based competitive game!\u00a0 In this game your main adversary is yourself!!<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first game that I have made on the itch.io page, and although it is far from the first game I've ever made, it is the first one I have completed. With all of life to bog down development, the project has taken a long time to make, especially since it has been done pretty much by a single person, me. Regardless, I am proud to present it to the public.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to all of the friends and family that have helped me and supported me on this project, from play-testing to coding guidance. And a special thanks to the Huegels for inspiring this video game adaptation of the family classic, Meta!</p>\n<p>I've learned a lot while making this game, and many things were my first attempt, things like music, publishing and sound design.\u00a0 It is far from perfect and could certainly be improved upon.</p>\n<p>Because this is just a hobby, I cannot promise that Meta will be updated and continually cared for, as I might just forget about its existence.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy and have fun!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/8076d4c778b1a6c93013e1d8da248631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vel_5_tiempo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
