So it looks like the solo game developer forgot the purpose of bullets?</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Wowie Jam 2.0.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Click and shoot. Shooting pushes the player in the opposite direction with great force. This force can be used to kill enemies because not all enemies can be killed with the bullets. And before I forget. Enemies spawn and replace the leftover bullets. So don't shoot too much. And also remeber to shoot yourself into the bullets it gives points.</p>\r\nContact\r\n<p>If you have ANY questions (the game, source code, other) then you can contact me at Twitter @Brandhyw or andreasbrandhoej@hotmail.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14ecb0a328cafabc45ddc8ae005d9076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Brandhyw"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
