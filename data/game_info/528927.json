It's about the race against time. You play as a wizard who's collecting the final ingredients needed to complete his potion of immortality. He's tried to make this potion once before, and it went horribly wrong. But on the plus side, he now has the ability to make a youthful clone of himself... a little too youthful maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See if you can collect the 3 potion ingredients needed to beat the game, and while you're at it, see if you can collect the 3 hidden name fragments hidden throughout.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the 'Arrow Keys' or 'WASD' to move</p>\n<p>Press 'C' to create a clone of yourself</p>\n<p>Press 'Z' to swap between controlling characters</p>\n<p>Press 'X' to interact with your environment\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press 'Space' to use your power-ups! Each character can only have one power-up at a time. If you have the Ice Power-Up, you can freeze an enemy and press 'X' to turn the ice into a\u00a0\u00a0solid block that you can jump on. Don't like where the ice block is? Press 'X' again and you're free to move it around again!</p><p>Please Note: This is unfortunately still a Work-In-Progress. It's not quite possible to beat the game yet, but have fun exploring our levels!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/739/739d6277b53d1c31e4b3aaf421eaab4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peow2373"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
