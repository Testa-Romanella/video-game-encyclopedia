You can try to compete with others and try to get into top 10. There is not much else at this point, only one level and one leaderboard.</p>\n<p>The game was supposed to be done as a part of Brackeys Game jam 2022.1 but it wasn't due to a lack of time.</p><p>My main gol was to create a simple platformer with working online highscore and I will continue improoving that knowledge. I would like to release a new map every 1-2 weeks and add some more features and content, yet still, try to keep it very minimalistic.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to let me know any feedback or what you would like to see here in the future.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb8eb07050164ab37f30be45947db42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jin9310"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
