At least, an early alpha version of it.</p>\n<p>This should be a good \"vertical slice\" of what to expect in the full game. Some important things (like NPCs and housing) aren't in yet, but those will come later.</p>\n<p>Some things might be broken as heck. I *think* I got all the important bugs, but of course there'll still be some that I haven't found or been able to fix, mainly with saving or visual errors. Let me know of any issues you find!</p>\n\n<p>Controller support IS in, but I've only tested it with an Xbox One controller, and button prompts will show up as xbox regardless of what controller you're actually using.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28fee9ff470a0a07d73f10a76b09462e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
