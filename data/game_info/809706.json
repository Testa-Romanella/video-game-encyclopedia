I like the item usage from Phasmophobia: not just find a key and use it on a\u00a0door, but actually use it for prolonged periods of time. And, I guess, Granny: find the item to get the other one/access other area.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Full version has 5 nights for story,\u00a0then you can continue onwards, with each night getting progressively harder.</p>\n<p><strong><em>ANY\u00a0IDEAS, PROBLEMS, QUESTIONS, CRITICISM ARE WELCOMED.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This Demo will allow you to play Night 1.<br/>If you liked the game and want to support me, you can buy FULL version on Steam!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:33:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1da6019a358590e5de4a9ffb03302e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eevoe"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
