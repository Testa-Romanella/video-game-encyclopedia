I thought there are so many possibilities - and I ended up like in this meme \"I have no idea what I am doing\". The main idea was something like \"Groove Coaster\" but apparently my 3d Unity skills\u00a0 needs some refinement. It ended up as a simple avoid upcoming obstacles game. PS. I probably should have used some copyright free music instead of this piece. But Every good music game has a Japanese song in them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What went good: I have learned that sometimes to finish the project it is best to go with a simple solution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What went bad: My idea of a game was vivid as was my idea about my 3D Unity skills. I need to pick up a course or 2 to develop better skills to use the 3D environment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236ac03b42b2714d5417fe4f140cdc62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
