{"id": 91274, "slug": "courages-curse", "name": "Courage's Curse", "name_original": "Courage's Curse", "description": "<p>This horror game and it's story is a twist on the Courage the Cowardly Dog episode, \"King Ramses Curse.\"</p>\n<p>Story: Eustace has buried the slab in the basement to prevent anyone from stealing it. But King Ramses is not pleased with this at all. He'll do anything to get his slab back, even if it means possessing Muriel to find the slab for him and killing anyone who gets in their way.</p>\n<p>As you can tell, this is a Courage the Cowardly Dog horror game, to be honest, I'm not sure if this one came out well, maybe it did, maybe it didn't. I'm probably just being paranoid as usual when it comes to new releases, lol. But anyway, I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>And yes, I gotta work on and finish Dracula's Castle Alpha 3 next, I can't get side tracked again!</p>\n<p>Do you enjoy my games and want to support me?
