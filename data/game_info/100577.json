Two birds, their love forbidden by their families, escape down a river on a rusty old kettle. They\u2019ll eat flies to stay full, dodge floating debris, and share some quiet moments together.</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>This game was designed over the weekend by Rebecca Kremer, the artist, and Joshua Hurd, the developer.</p>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\n\n\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>This game is meant for two players at one computer, so grab a friend and get cozy! The WASD keys control Sparrow, while the Arrow Keys control Crow. To start, Crow is in charge of steering the kettle. You can move left and right. Meanwhile, Sparrow is busy snacking on bugs. Crane your neck to catch all those tasty morsels.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on your hunger meter - when Crow starts to get peckish, it\u2019s time to trade places! Press the Space bar, and the two birds will switch. Now Sparrow steers while Crow eats. Every so often, the pair will stop to chat. Click an answer and watch their love grow. Say something awkward and they might start to squabble - but don\u2019t stress too much.</p>\n\n\r\nChange Log\r\n<p><strong>April 24, 2018</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed crashes due to audio clip triggers</li><li>Optimized post-processing effects to boost FPS\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/2711c404f010033ca577c806f8016f9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sparrowhousegames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
