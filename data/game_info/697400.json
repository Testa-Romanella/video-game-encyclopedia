{"id": 697400, "slug": "bloated-balloon", "name": "Bloated Balloon", "name_original": "Bloated Balloon", "description": "<p>A game made in 3 hours for Trijam #145.</p>\n<p>The theme for this jam was \"Anti-[you choose]\" and I somehow landed upon the word \"Anti-inflammation\". I ended up creating a game where you control a balloon and small person, where your goal is to collect the anti-inflammatory pills falling from the sky to prevent the balloon from swelling and popping.</p>\n<p>You can control the character with W and D or the arrow keys.
