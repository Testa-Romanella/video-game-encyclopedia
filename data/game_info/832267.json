You play as a human helping the cursed villagers who were once seals. They need you to fetch them fish in specific order to help them return to their regular form.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone with Windows can download here:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/11RgvEBKoK2bM88UzjDogIdegWSqn6FWk/view?usp=shari...</p>\n\n<p>Use of Theme:</p>\n<p>We used the theme of trust through the order system. You are not aware of which ingredients were submitted to the villagers. This means that you must rely and trust the words of your teammates to figure out which ingredients were already submitted and which ones are still required. Collaborate together to get things done.</p>\n\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow = Movement</p>\n<p>Left click = Interact</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Run around and click on the ponds to begin fishing, once the alert pops up left click again to complete fishing. Once you get fish they will show at the bottom of your screen in the hotbar. You can then deliver these fish to the respective villagers to complete orders with your team. Make sure to discuss with your teammates to figure out which ingredients are still required for an order to be fully complete. Best of luck and have fun! :D</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Horou#0128 - Artist and Illustrator</p><p>Kerryu#0001 - Programmer</p><p>Samantha L Harris (Sam15#5368) - Animation / illustration\u00a0</p><p>Forest - Music and SFX (SoundCloud: forest*)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:23:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09c3f129749375e05836e38fa3ae146d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["GhostiStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
