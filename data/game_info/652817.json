I got this idea specifically from the theme \"Future\", the idea is you have to think into the future in order to complete levels. The background music is a recording I made of a song I first heard on w3, the mistakes in the recording\u00a0are\u00a0<strong>on purpose</strong> since I figured it would feel more informal you see.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c9/1c9e8dcb468badda35d721df5683f147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["loui4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
