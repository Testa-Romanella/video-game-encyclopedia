It has no licensing from Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association; meaning that Nolan Ryan is the only non-fictional ballplayer in the entire game. All the other players have names that appear to be given names while Nolan Ryan uses his surname.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66f83701456570ccc5018a1850ab8953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Affect"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Romstar", "SETA"], "esrb_rating": null}
