One side attempts to plant and detonate bombs in their opponents\u2019 base, and the other, quite reasonably, attempts to stop them. <br/><br/>Designed for 4-versus-4 players, each round earns money (or \"volts\") which the teams can spend on outlandish equipment and weaponry. Take a stealth suit, slip past the enemy\u2019s defences and snipe from the shadows, or dive straight into the fray, deflecting incoming shots with the reflector shield. Or toss a time bomb into the mosh-pit and watch as bullets and bots dance in balletic slow-motion!
