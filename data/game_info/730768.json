But this is what we had in mind:<br/><br/>Our idea was to make a game that was mainly focussed on things that are real and not real. At a certain point in the game you just wouldn't know what is real anymore and slowly go crazy.</p>\n<p>At the end you would walk through a long hallway displaying pictures and videos of things you did all day and they slowly got darker and darker. Eventually you would come to a stop in front of a mirror were you reflection would kill himself ending up with you waking up from a nightmare in your bedroom and start the whole game over again.<br/><br/>Our focus was to visualise mental health problems for people that have trouble speaking about it or trouble having people understand what they are going through. The endless struggle and letting yourself get overwhelmed with darkness ending up in suicide.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d313da454654dd95ba0c5273483952cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MeatChips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
