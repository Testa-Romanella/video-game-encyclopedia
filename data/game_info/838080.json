It is a fantasy castle defence game where you must fend off waves of undead. To defend the castle you must work together with an AI knight by throwing your sword at the undead\u00a0between the battlements of your castle. Remember you must be precise with your throws or you will lose precious time!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>RMB or Spacebar: Throw Sword\r\n</p>\n<p>W: Increase Throw Power\r\n</p>\n<p>S: Decrease Throw Power\r\n</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0Move Left\r\n</p>\n<p>D: Move Right\r\n</p>\n<p>Move Cursor: Aim\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips And Tricks</strong></p>\n<p>Catching the\u00a0sword is much faster than picking it up of the ground so try and throw the sword so it will hit enemies and land in an area that the Ai will be able to catch it. The brain upgrades for the Ai will help with this as it will react better to your throws</p>\n\n<p>When upgrading it is important to balance your upgrades. A very fast but dumb knight will always be worse than a knight with a little bit of everything.</p>\n\n<p>The most powerful enemy in the game is the Wizard, it fires fireballs which deal massive damage to your castle and they can teleport around the courtyard.\u00a0Throwing your sword at them just as they release a fireball will allow you to damage the wizard itself and destroy the fireball at the same time!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Created By:\u00a0Max Ponting<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Music Source</strong></p>\n<p>All Music By: Marllon Silva (xDeviruchi)\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu Track: Exploring The Unknown</p>\n<p>Game Track 1: Decisive Battle</p>\n<p>Game Track 2: Prepare For Battle</p>\n<p>All Tracks Can Be Found Here:\u00a0(43) 8-Bit Fantasy &amp; Adventure Music - YouTube</p>\n\n<p><strong>Install Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1.
