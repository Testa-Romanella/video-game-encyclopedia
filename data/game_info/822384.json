Craptastic can mean ludicrous, bonkers, outrageous, funny, wacky, far out, and silly. The theme simply implies that the compo was just for a bit of fun, not a serious coding competition. Competitors were welcome to make an excellent game to submit for the compo, or games that contain some humour or silliness to fit more with the theme, but they didn\u2019t have to!\r\n</p>\n<p>The competition was limited to 4KB. Yes, any entry submitted could be no more than 4KB when compressed!\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy these wonderful games that were made for the compo. Thanks to all of the competitors and compo prize sponsors.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Games List:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Please keep an eye out on each game's page for possible updates and enhancements.
