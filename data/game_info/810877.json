Press the right key before enemy shoots.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Two years ago I noticed a nice C64 homebrew game called Tombstones (2017) by Megastyle. I liked it and I tought I could do something similar.\r\n</p>\n<p>Atari 8-bit computers are 2.5 years older than C64 but nonetheless have some strenghts that I could have used, even considered the fact I am not a skilled coder.</p>\n<p>Thanks to 16 shades of one color graphics mode, I decided to make the game look like old black and white western movies and I\u00a0designed a smooth background.</p>\n<p>Taking advantage of A8 widescreen and overscan features, there's a \"cinemascope\" screen and duelist enter from sides without borders.\r\n</p>\n<p>Atari sprites have a limited horizontal width but unlimited height. Therefore I asked TIX\u00a0if he could design tall characters; he\u00a0made\u00a0<strong>ninety</strong>\u00a0<strong>16x64 pixels 3 colors animation</strong>\u00a0<strong>frames</strong>\u00a0and smartly solved the problem of the deaths, not easy because of narrow sprites.</p>\n<p>Regarding music, I asked Miker\u00a0to make Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly main theme.</p>\n<p>He always wanted to do it for Atari and in fact the result is really good.<br/>Recently the Italian composer, one of the greatest and most influential film composers of all time, passed away and we would like to honor him.<br/>Miker made victory\u00a0(Johnny Cash Ballad of a Teenage Queen)\u00a0and death tunes too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was programmed with DMSC's\u00a0FastBasic\u00a0for Atari 8-bit computers.\u00a0Not only he made an awesome new language, but he helped me when I was stuck.</p>\n<p>Sprites were designed with Paul Lay's Atari Player Editor\u00a0and tunes\u00a0were composed with Radek Sterba's Raster Music Tracker.</p>\n<p>The game entered ABBUC Software Contest 2020 (7th place).<br/></p>\n<p>It runs\u00a0on PAL and NTSC machines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T07:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf1538962f594c8d76df13680a57af3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Filippo Santellocco"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
