All of the game's sprites and graphics were created by me. The shooting, movement and the explosion sounds were made with BeepBox, while I recorded a pen and a light switch to create the other sounds. </p>\n<p>This is my first attempt in creating a \u00a0graphical game (I did a text adventure for another jam not so long ago). I didn't manage to add other control \"minigames\"\u00a0that I had in mind, and also\u00a0other sounds, enemies, levels and various graphical effects. \u00a0My main regret was not having enough time to create a musical background, but I'm still quite satisfied in how the sounds turned out to be.\u00a0</p>\r\n Known Bugs <p>I assume that once the Jam is finished, I can't upload a new version of the game, so I'll report here all the bugs that will come up, eventually.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>The \"HELP\" command says that \"MOVE\" makes the Robot move to the left, while it actually goes to the right </li>\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n<strong> Made for Quarantine Game Jam 2020 </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T06:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b3980e70daadbb1f6d66544827cfb5ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sanjuro"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
