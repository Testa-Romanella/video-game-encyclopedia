Engine brake: In downhill, put the gears in first or second. it will reduce wheels rotation velocity to keep vehicle slow.<br/>2. Engine Stall: In Manual Transmission, if RPM lower than specific level engine will be stalled.<br/>3. Brook: when you across the brook the tires will be slippery and angular damping will rise.<br/>4. Footbrake: When you press footbrake it will cut off power connection from engine to wheel. So you can raise RPM more easily.<br/>5. Mud&amp;Ice: Mud and Ice will greatly reduce friction of tires.<br/>6. Neutral Gear: If the gears in neutral, you can raise RPM easily.<br/>7. Rocks: Rocks have more friction than dirt. It can be pros and cons at the same time.<br/>8. Signs: Watch out the signs. there are many tips that you can count on.<br/>9. Snow: Snow will raise angular damping of your tires most.<br/>10: Weather: The weather will determine the friction of tires.<br/>11: Winch: Winch even can save overturned vehicle.</p>\n<p>Search Keyword: 4x4, extreme game, off road climbing, 4wd, 4-wheel drive, off road driving, off road drive, car, racing, off-road race, off road race</p>\n<p>*korean/english supported.(Must adjust its settings.)<br/>*Auto Transmission bug not fixed yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da79a87634a681a7d908ed43fdc3cb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["gaminslab"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
