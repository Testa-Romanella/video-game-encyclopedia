Many of your comrades are stranded in the remaining debris. Find as many of them as you can, and guide them to the Home Hub. Who knows, maybe there's a medal in it for you in the end, if you make it.</p>\n<p>This is a submission to Godot Wild Jam #34. The theme of the jam was \"space\".</p>\n<p>A short guide on how to play:</p>\n<ul><li>Use left, right and space to control the ship (or rebind controls as you please).</li><li>Look for your comrades (blue by default, color scheme can be changed). When you locate them, get close to them to activate their ship.</li><li>They will follow you, but may get off screen sometimes.</li><li>There's an indicator ring around your ship to help you. On it, there's an icon pointing to the direction of the home hub (your target). There are also dots pointing to the nearest of your comrades.</li><li>Space junk will hinder you and your flock, but otherwise is harmless (for now!).</li></ul>\r\n\r\nLicenses\r\n<ul>\n<li>This game uses the Godot Game Engine.\r\n\n<p>\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
