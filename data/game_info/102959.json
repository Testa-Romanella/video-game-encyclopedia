You can view the source code for this project on Github:\u00a0https://github.com/jeremycryan/ExtraCreditsJam2018</em></p>\n<p>You know in older adventure style games where you reach a prompt that says \"you can't do that?\" Well this game is kind of like that.\u00a0</p><p>You essentially play as the Navi of this story: a helpful sprite who occasionally interjects during the adventure of a dauntless hero. You may aid him, you may advise him, but regardless of what you say or don't say, he will be marching forward like the hero he is.</p>\n<p>A interactive story with ramping excitement, heavy emphasis on emotion, and simplistic gameplay.<br/></p><p><strong>Note: A post-jam version of this game is available for download.\u00a0</strong>It has no new content, script, or art, but has a few bugfixes and usability improvements.
