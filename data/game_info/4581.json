{"id": 4581, "slug": "crysis", "name": "Crysis", "name_original": "Crysis", "description": "<p>The game that started the popular Crysis series. You control a member of Delta Force special military squad, codenamed Nomad. Your squad was sent to rescue a group of American archeologists who are about to be imprisoned by North Korea. The archeologists recently made a world-changing discovery that needs to be protected by any means. Soon it turns out your real enemy is not North Koreans, but rather something not from this world. The plot is told partly through cutscenes, but mostly through in-game events that the player participates in.<br />\nAll Delta Force soldiers are equipped with super-powered futuristic Nanosuits, which are the trademark feature of Crysis series. The Nanosuits provide four types of powers that can (and should) be switched on a fly during battles. &quot;Strenght&quot; enhances the wearer&#39;s abilities in melee combat, &quot;Armor&quot; protects him from the damage, &quot;Speed&quot; allows you to move faster, and &quot;Cloak&quot; renders you almost invisible to opponents. Besides the story mode, there are two multiplayer modes that allow up to 32 players to participate. Instant Action mode is a traditional deathmatch, while Power Struggle mode features two teams (designed to look like American and North Korean) trying to destroy each other\u2019s bases.</p>", "metacritic": 91, "released": "2007-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/90f/90fd5e569bc4c4a666c588a732124908.jpg", "website": "http://www.ea.com/crysis", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 146, "owned": 2566, "beaten": 1300, "toplay": 110, "dropped": 301, "playing": 29}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 81, "ratings_count": 1062, "suggestions_count": 644, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1069, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Crytek"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
