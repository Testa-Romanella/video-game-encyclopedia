There he founded his start-up \"Syn Corp\" and soon took over the citys soda market with his amazing Syn-Cola he invented.<br/>Unfortunatly, the pressure the job was giving him was too much, and Jiao tried to relieve himself with  cocaine of his good old friend Mr. Hitz Heroin. <br/>This destroyed his bond with his family, and since noboy wanted to do business with him anymore, he left the company and ended up on the street.<br/>With no money left to buy his cocaine, he slowly overcame his addiction and managed to pick up a job as a taxi driver.<br/>Doing that, he somewhat restored his bond with his family and is supporting them with the little money he is making.<br/></p>\n<p>I dont want to hold you morally hostage, but this whole backstory made Jiao deeply suicidal. Supporting his family with the taxi money and trying to make everything OK again is the only thing thats keeping him from ending it all!<br/>So you better not fuck up :) No pressure :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>Pick passengers up at the yellow beams of light, and deliver them to the green ones.<br/>In case youve never played a videogame before, controlling the car is done with WASD.<br/>And if you wanna spice the driving up, and drift around corners, hold SHIFT down.</p>\n<p>Oh, and dont help the taxi driver commit suicide by driving of the edges of the city!</p><p><strong>Special Thanks to:<br/></strong>Butter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T04:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/81531f0a1116f2cf0b15b47657b0cdda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scayze"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
