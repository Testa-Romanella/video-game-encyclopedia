The 2 Colors Game Jam was a challenge to make a game that only uses 2 colors. I decided to do a monochrome thing but it could be any 2 colors.</p>\n<p>There was also a theme. Well actually 2 themes \"<strong>You are the Weapon</strong>\u00a0\"and \"<strong>Space\". </strong> Kinda blew off that part. I thought the 2 color thing was the only theme and learned about that part afterwards. My bad.</p>\n<p>Originally this game was going to have a linear narrative. A 5-10 minute vignette, I had a whole idea of a final boss you need to upgrade a weapon for, a bandit hideout, Vegeta was gonna be there, and a bunch of other stuff. Couldn't finish that game unfortunatly, that one was going to be pretty cool.</p>\n<p>I made the player controls and one enemy for that game, and this game is about shooting that enemy over and over as it spawns. It's not a\u00a0 good game, but the original game was kinda strange too so maybe it's not surprising. There's not really a goal, so think of this like a relaxing, meditative game. That's a good thing to say when a game has no objective. I don't know much about meditation but it's supposed to be good for you so give it a try!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wish I could have done that original idea.</p>\n<p>I use sound effects from 2600 games. It sounds like a game a character on TVis playing and that's fun.</p>\n<p>Move with arrow keys. Fire with Z. Only one bullet at a time. It shoots opposite the direction you last moved. It makes the shooting feel awkward but I wanted that, to see how bad it felt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e665aeaf29b194284f64ef3818aebc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RCoriWithTheStory"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
