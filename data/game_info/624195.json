Use the back bumper on the left to turn on torch if there is one, and the right back bumper to shoot at people, move around with the left stick, aim crosshairs with the right stick. Press in the right stick to run, and press in the left stick to auto target your enemy. Stamina is used when you run and auto target. Ammo is blue, and it regenerates slowly, but some guns use it very slowly but are short range. Health is red. Who is ready to get fighting? Enjoy . . .\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>RSC Games &amp; Duckigi Games</p>\n\r\nNote<p>This game is not for slow computers, will lag bad, and not have fun, Map 1 usually works on all computers, but the other two, they are a little . . . different . . .\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game may not work with wired controllers, and works best with 2 people, the game is up to 4 player. Games will last long, so to speed them up try to play the easier levels, Level 2 usually takes the longest to assert dominance in. Thanks for playing! Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T10:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/442ca741b96421b3ca648beff1f60b9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Duckigi"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
