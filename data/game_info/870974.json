The amount of robots that spawn will increase the further you go, and to kill them, you must simply bonk them on the head once - this is made easy with the \"lock and slaughter\" system. Health boosts will occasionally appear as you go, and you should probably try to avoid getting hit by robot bullets.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>- SHIFT - Lock onto enemy either above or below you, you cannot jump while locked onto enemy</p>\n<p>- LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - Kill an enemy above or below you</p>\n<p>- A / D / SPACE - Left / Right / Jump</p>\n\n<p>Music by @loomissss on Twitter<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/8124249156213e09b764c17a427f96f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JayAllT"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
