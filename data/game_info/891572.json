The lead game designer, Pixitales has made a lot of games over the past 3 years.\u00a0The biggest star of this project is\u00a0importing 3D models made in Vroid Studio into Unity. This made this project very fun to work with and we learned a lot of new things. One struggle we had is we are missing a writer on the team, so I have to take over. I have never written a full game story in my life. There might be writing mistakes here and there. At first, I wasn't going to publish this because the story isn't finished, but the team was very supportive and now I submitted it.\u00a0I hope you guys enjoy it!<br/></p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>Racheal works for an app called\u00a0Rent-A-Friend. She gets\u00a0paid for being friends with people for a limited time.\u00a0 She needs\u00a0money to pay for her little sister's hospital bills who is\u00a0being treated for a rare disease. When a rare opportunity comes up, a family\u00a0is worried about their daughter and is\u00a0willing to pay Rachael a large sum of money to transfer schools and\u00a0befriend with\u00a0until the end of the school year.\u00a0</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li>Pixitales - Game designer, 2d artist, programmer, story writer</li><li>Invadererik - Programmer, shader</li><li>Himeko Katagiri (Seifuku Sound) - Music composer</li></ul>\n<p>Main assets used</p>\n<ol><li>Character models are made using Vroid Studio.</li><li>Ink, dialogue script writer </li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/72071fd7b03767143bca00f729c1ee15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixitales", "invadererik", "Himeko Katagiri"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
