Somewhere that you move through, rather than a destination in and of itself. Think of an airport, or a staircase. They are not the place you are traveling to, but a place you must travel through to get to where you\u2019re going. A waiting room. A long hallway. An elevator. These are all liminal spaces, and each hold their own power.</em></p>\n<p><em>Threshold - Winter </em>is an interactive storytelling game about navigating a space that is not your own. The game is written with a branching design that allows the player to choose their story, and features over 25 different paths to an ending.
