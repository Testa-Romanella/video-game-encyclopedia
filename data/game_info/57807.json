The gameplay involves obtaining power ups and slowing down opponents, in order to reach the finish line first. The gameplay is similar to that of the Wipeout series. There are 10 sectors containing 5 tracks each. They are total of 40 race tracks along with 7 usable ships. For every track competed by the player, a new ship is unlocked. Unlike most racing games, the player can steer off course away from the track at the cost of lowered speed.</p>\n<p>Players step into the shoes of Connor Rhodes, ace pilot of Earth as he competes against aliens around the galaxy. Each has its own personality and ship. The game features pre-rendered cutscenes between each race.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Mindscape"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["MINDSCAPE", "J-Wing"], "esrb_rating": null}
