{"id": 121166, "slug": "brottas-underground", "name": "Brottas Underground", "name_original": "Brottas Underground", "description": "<p><em>Brottas Underground</em> is a funky fun game and an indirect sequel to <em>Brottas Land</em>. It stars Raegun Brotta, a descendent of Fatso Brotta, in his attempts to stop the Baddii Empire and their insidious leader Riichard Hydrah, he himself being a descendent of the villain from <em>Brottas Land</em>.</p><p>After the climatic face-off at the end of <em>Brottas Land</em>, the Maidists have rebuilt their civilization and enjoyed many years of peace and prosperity. Until today...</p><p>Featuring similar game mechanics to the first instalment, <em>Brottas Underground</em> improves substantially on the previous game. Featuring multiple new gameplay styles and mechanics, the game is sure to please! The \"get a good score\" mechanic from the last game has been removed, in favour of an item percentage sort of thing. The number of items you collect throughout your adventure changes the ending you receive! As a result of this more complicated method, a save feature has also been implemented! (Keep in mind, you only have one save file! Use it wisely!)</p><p>I have been pouring my heart and soul into this game for the better half of six years, and through multiple reboots and frustrated pain, I'm glad that I can finally put this game out for people to play, and that I can move forward with my head held high, ready to make many a new game and to please and entertain people for many years to come!</p><p>(The game also comes with a full soundtrack download.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc3/cc37bfdc0db86360e08281f3b030289f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G0ATFAC3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
