You will sink into an old, cursed mine that is said to have no limits. AND <strong>BINGO</strong>! By dint of perseverance (and especially avarice), you will find a cave filled with magnificent treasures. At its center, a distinctive object will catch your attention: a gold shovel set with beautiful gems. By grabbing it, the cave will collapse and a curse will be unleashed: you will never be able to get out of this cave and will be condemned to dig indefatigably if you do not want to die. Your only ally in this madness: your new shovel!</p>\n<p><em>\u2013 Enirad et Nidar\u00a0 (By Pauline Morill</em><em>e et Joris Darphin)</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Features :</strong>\n\n<ul><li>You will have <strong>4 seconds</strong> to dig.
