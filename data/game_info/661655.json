Travel the entire galaxy in search of lost memories, and find out the origins of <em>Nelumbo</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Nelumbo </em>is a 2D exploration and platform video game where, through the environment and the NPCs, the player discovers the story of <em>Nemsi</em>. As the players progress, they will acquire skills, which will allow them to discover and visit new planets and areas. \r\nWe are inspired by games like <em>Hollow Knight</em> and <em>Gris</em>, both artistically and thematically.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Nelumbo </em>has two main foundations on which its gameplay is based. First, the part that resembles the platforms and puzzles, whereas you progress in the game you will acquire new skills and powers that will allow you to rediscover the areas you have already visited and explore new ones. Secondly, you will have to search all over <em>Nemsi </em>for the memories of the different inhabitants of the galaxy, and discover the origin of this strange disease through a unique way of reviving this lost memoirs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CHARACTERS</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>These are the inhabitants of <em>Miseet</em>, your home planet. They\u2019ve been affected by <em>Nelumbo</em>, so they don\u2019t always say things that make sense, but they\u2019re good people. After seeing you with this curious new helmet, which you put on at the beginning of the game, they will have enough confidence to ask you for help in finding their memories.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Nelumbo </em>was born as a Final Degree Project made by four students from different careers and disciplines.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is currently in development, so what is posted here is a prototype of the first planet, which can be played with both keyboard and remote control (although it is preferable to play remote control). \r\nWe hope you enjoy the game, and thank you for leaving feedback of any kind in the comments.</p>\n<p><strong>TEAM</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Albert del Arco</strong>: Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Marta Freixas:</strong> Narrative Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Erich Lerbs</strong>: Lead Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Sinici</strong>: Art Director\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Edu Coll</strong>: Collaborating artist\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Pau de Dau</strong>: Soundtrack\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a11e9d08e1ecd4e1323644270140110.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LostGalaxyStudio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
