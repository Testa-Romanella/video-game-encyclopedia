All game pieces are dice, rolling across the board fighting each other with the numbers on their faces. The dice will\u00a0even\u00a0confuse the most focused of minds and will challenge both your geometrical thinking, as well as your tactical planning. Carefully consider the consequences every roll can have and think further than your enemy to secure victory. Fight either your friend on local versus, practice against a bot or try to survive endless waves of weaker AI dice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Mouse &amp; left mouse click<br/>Escape - opens the\u00a0pause menu with settings and\u00a0 \"How To Play\"</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to move your dice. When you move, you also attack. the number you roll determines the damage you deal spread over the range of the number you just had. The number on the dice also work as hit points, which will be subtracted when damage is taken.\u00a0<br/>Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
