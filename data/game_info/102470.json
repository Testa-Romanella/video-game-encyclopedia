Their problems reflect the problems of our times.

The stories emphasize realism through their dilemmas, but light fantasy elements allow a level of abstraction to make the topics more palatable to a consumer audience. Through the players' choices, players find out about the characters' stories, and are posed with what they would do in the characters' position, while the characters' stories continue unchanged. By respecting the characters' agency, players can empathize with their conflict while circumventing the problem of erasing the validity of that characters' choice, which is a common fear for writing marginalized video game protagonists.</p>\n\n<p>~~<br/></p>\n<p>Writer, Programmer, Game Designer - Charles Hans Huang<br/></p>\n<p>Cover art by Wen Shi<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd4856616f868cf8fc7abc7575b9087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Charles Hans Huang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
