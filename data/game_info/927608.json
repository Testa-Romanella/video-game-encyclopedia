This is my first game and I created it in my free time. Thank you!</strong></p>\n<p>I appreciate every review!</p><br/>Thank you for your positive comments on my game!<p>I'm thinking about making \"sleeping alone 2\" with a whole new better story, better mechanics and especially with a bit longer playing time.
