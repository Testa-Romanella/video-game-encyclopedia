We are all beginner game devs.\u00a0 The start menu and last level wasn't working on the last hour. Thank god we fixed it and submit by miracle.\u00a0Our music guy didnt do anything, moral support guy didnt show, one game dev left due to stress, one guy spent the whole jam working on the menu. I spent all night with only few hours of sleep working on the art and help others with codings.\u00a0I like to make a special thanks to Sake0706. He has been a great help.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits go to:</p>\n<p>PixiTales: Game dev, artist</p>\n<p>Sake0706: Game dev</p>\n<p>HT-Kuzan: Game dev</p>\n<p>Assets used: Dotween, Kenny UI,\u00a0 GT-K, Game music pack,\u00a0 and Opengameart for sfx.</p>\n\n<p>You can find me on twitter or deviantart</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/home</p>\n<p>https://www.deviantart.com/pixitales<br/></p>\n<p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56b7614f2786e7147165f35197f93f7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixitales"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
