{"id": 484936, "slug": "vr-jetpack-game", "name": "VR Jetpack Game", "name_original": "VR Jetpack Game", "description": "Physics-based VR with full freedom of flight.  VR that feels and controls like a real jetpack.  A real-time multiplayer VR arena.<br/><br/>Players can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an example).  It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport or D-pad controls of most VR games.  This includes but is not limited to being able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting any special buttons (all controller angle/position based).  It's up to your own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to do in the air.  You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling cables.<br/><br/>Note that this means you can and will go upside-down.  Like with roller coasters, skydiving, or any other real-life thrill or extreme sport, this experience is not for everyone, but for the right people, this comes very close to feeling like flying (and swinging) in real-life.  If you can't tolerate skydiving or going upside-down in real life, don't play.  Treat this like an actual new sport or vehicle and not just a viewing experience from home. Don't play if you just want something quick under 5 minutes.  Think of how long it takes to learn to bike, ski, or other sports.  It's no different here.  <br/><br/>When you first start out, spread your arms out like you're balancing and keep the controllers upright.  The farther your arms are out to the sides, the slower and more stable you are.  Tap each one of the thrusters individually first (thumb press).  The thrust comes from under each controller based on the angle you hold the controllers.  Don't point forward or down to go.  Don't let your arms stick out in front.  There are graphics and videos at the start, so pay close attention to those.  When you've gotten good enough control to hover, you can bring the controllers closer together for more speed.  Tapping both thrusters at the same time while held close together will also let you go sonic speed.<br/><br/>The game is currently being released as Early Access, as the core mechanics and flying functionality along with multiplayer have been done for over a year now.  The slowest part of development, and what is taking the most time for me as a 1-man team, is the more traditional parts of the game, such as map building, graphics, and other assets. I'm hoping that, as the game builds interest, perhaps I will be able to get help working on these other more time-intensive parts of the game.  Of interest to me is if players are willing to create and share their own maps for others to fly and experience, as well as sharing skins/mods for the appearances of the actual player.
