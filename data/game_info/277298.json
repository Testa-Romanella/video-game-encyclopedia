You play as Tim-Tim, the last hope for a kingdom that's been taken over by an evil sorcerer. This is the first platformer made at Spoonweaver Studios. The idea behind it was to give combine some of the ideas behind Megaman\u00a0 with some ideas from Metroid. The game itself is nowhere near as polish as either of those titles, but does it's own thing. The game has been enjoyed by many and completed by few. Getting past the first boss, Steve the fire-breathing dinosaur, is an accomplishment few have achieved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d678f7dd2989692064d24b4b07374ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spoonweaver"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
