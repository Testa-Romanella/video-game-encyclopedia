And while the game jam has ended, this game is very much still in development! Look forward to updates in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>Keyboard/mouse and standard XBOX gamepads are supported. Hold I / Back in-game to see all controls.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Features that could be cool to develop at some point:</strong> More enemies and flowers, more diverse environments, friendly NPCs, better combat, story bits, boss battles, and of course SFX and music.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog for v0.5 (21 August 2016):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Added skeleton run animation.</li><li>Improved skeleton AI (now with pathfinding!)</li><li>Added \"squirting cucumbers\". Hit them, and they go flying! Seeds hurt you <em>and</em> enemies.</li><li>Now uses YoYo Compiler. It seems to work decently.</li><li>General optimisation and minor text fixes. Hopefully it runs a bit better now. Still much to improve in terms of performance though!</li></ul>\n<p>Updates currently put on hold indefinitely, as I am busy with other things.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Developed by </strong><strong>@Bakufreak</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inspired by Ribbon Black's cover</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2d5776075625e97293c48cb68c2b4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baku"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
