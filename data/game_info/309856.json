On one side, prosperity and wealth. On the other, poverty. And you? You're the one set on taking it all down.<br/><br/>Neon Kicks is an action game focused on speed, precision, and narrowly avoiding death. In this game, you'll find:<br/><ul><li> Teleporting shoes! Kick off each shoe individually, and teleport to thrown shoes.<br/></li><li> A variety of obstacles! Everything in or on the border wall is trying to kill you, so watch out.
