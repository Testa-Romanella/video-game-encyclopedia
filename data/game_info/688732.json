You can collect groups of three gems or more by click and dragging over them. In Classic mode, this goes on and on with the level increasing. When the levels increase, the game adds in all sorts of obstacles to make it harder for you to select a group. How far can you get?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As always, love feedback, and hope you are looking forward to the next one that I post!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:36:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/116e27474751c077d5fb7a8ce3f11253.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheSyXan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
