Your objective is to kill all the enemies in each level with 6 cool Weapons, use Physic rules to your advantage! ECARC is under active development.</p><p><strong>HTML5 EDITION:</strong><br/> The HTML5 Edition is a toned down version of ECARC that doesn't include Checkpoints, Weekly Challenge trying limits and a bunch of other stuff. To get the full feeling of the game, try the Windows version. I also recommend using the Fullscreen button.<br/></p><p><strong>CONTROLS: </strong><br/> LMB: Shoot<br/> Numbers (1-6): Switch Weapons<br/> R: Restart the current level<br/> F: Load last Checkpoint<br/> SPACE or Q: Cycle through all Weapons<br/>G: GameJolt Login<br/>H: Submit GameJolt Score<br/> TAB: Commandier</p><p><strong>ECARC COMMANDIER:</strong><br/> You've all probably played Source Engine games (and a lot of other games have this too). The Commandier is just another Console/Codebox system you can use to modify the Gameplay, Cheat, and stuff! Read 'commandier.txt' for info.</p><p><strong>GAMEJOLT API INTEGRATION:</strong><br/> ECARC (Both Windows and HTML5 Editions) support GameJolt Scoreboards/Trophies (known as Achievements in-game). View the Scoreboard/Trophies on ECARC's GameJolt page.</p><p>ECARC is also available on GameJolt, IndieDB and GameMaker: Studio's Steam Workshop.
