I actually made this in the early 2010s, specifically around 2012 to 2013. For those of you who follow speedrunning, this was after Games Done Quick had gotten over its initial growing pains and experimental phase (For lack of a better phrase), but before it really settled into being the professional organization it is now. As it relates to this game, this is where the title come from--in those days, GDQ had realized \"Hey, we should probably build in buffers for setup into the schedule\"...but in an attempt to be \"cutesy\" (Again, the best way I can put it), they would name the setup blocks things like \"Super Setup Kart 64\" and give them official game-esque descriptions. I figured the logical conclusion to this would be actually MAKING a game called \"Setup\" (Or \"S.E.T.U.P.\") and trying to run it at a GDQ, back when they were a bit smaller. As it turned out, this never happened, for reasons I'll get into later.</p>\n<p>2. I got to thinking about stories that would only work in certain media and not in others. I don't know that I could turn \"Woman decides to kick the collective butt of her captors to free herself from her kidnapping\" into an interesting written story...but I could made it a moderately fun, simple beat-em-up. The title followed from a combination of this and number one.</p>\n<p>3. While I understand why they're no longer much of a thing with the death of arcades and all, I missed \"character-in-peril\" continue screens a la Final Fight, and wanted to pay tribute to that with one (Or two) of my own. Most of the plot, such that it is, followed from that. <br/></p><p>4. I wanted to see if I could take something, even something simple, from concept to completion. As it turned out, I failed in that regard, though I came close.</p>\n<p>I'm putting this up on itch.io mainly for archival purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T05:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23e4acd949d14ca22cdcb76974d3cc89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emptyeye"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
