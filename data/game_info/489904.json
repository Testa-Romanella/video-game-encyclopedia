Can you make it all the way to BitKnot City<br/>with everything intact?</p>\n<p>Notes / How to play the game--</p>\n<p>The game is essentially an autoscroller. The only<br/>real controlls come in the form of interacting with<br/>the enemies / cargo.</p>\n<p>CARGO--<br/>When one touches you, you may press DOWN<br/>to collect it. Collecting these are the main purpose<br/>of the game. They also serve as your \"health\". Do your best to make it to the end with as much as you can!</p>\n<p>MULEs--<br/>Mob based enemies. Right before they touch you, a prompt will appear with the \"A\" button. Press the \"A\" button right as it does to knock them aside!</p>\n<p>BTs--<br/>The most dangerous of enemies. They are slow and shambling at first, but if they make it to you, they'll be more keen to find you later. When one appears on screen, there is a random input that's needed to be pressed, consisting of any of the \"D-PAD\" keys as well as \"B/A BUTTONS\". You must enter the displayed input before it touches you to ensure you'll be safe. <br/>-------------------------</p>\n<p>If it's not entirely obvious, this game is based on the video game \"DEATH STRANDING\" by Hideo Kojima / Sony.
