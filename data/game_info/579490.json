But the gravity is supported with local gravity fields. There are also magnetic fields which are used to walk on any surface (if you have magnetic boots of course).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weightlessness makes no difference between a floor and a ceiling so don't be surprized when you see a workplace on every wall. This is space where a lot of weird things are possible.</p>\n\n<p>In this game you will solve puzzles using the properties of the space distorted with the local gravity fields, and getting into impossible places with magnetic boots.</p>\n<p>The game is on a prototyping stage right now, and the released version is intended to be used for the first playtests. If you want to play the demo version, please take part in a short survey, I\u00a0would hightly appreciate it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T09:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61ec7e98bd340f31db4b6b2be5a1e648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RogVevepla"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
