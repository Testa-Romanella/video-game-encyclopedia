IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD.</p>\n<p>This is a rough, unfinished version of a horror bowling game made a few years ago\u00a0by me and several friends while studying game design at Aalto University. The only time this has been shown was at my school's end of year exhibition and on my YouTube channel.\u00a0I have no plans to finish it, but a few people have asked to play so I'm releasing it.</p>\n<p>Remember, this is an unpolished prototype, not a full game. You may encounter bugs or be totally unable to run it.\u00a0I haven't tested this on anything other than my own Windows laptop. There is, unfortunately, no OSX version.\u00a0The game is\u00a0best played with a controller, because the mouse input is inverted to accommodate the controller. If you do play with mouse/keyboard, the left mouse click is your action button.\u00a0To quit the game, use alt-F4.</p>\n<p>The idea came when a lecturer said that new, interesting games could be created by mixing\u00a0different genres. \"But,\" he said, \"not all genres mix well. Like horror and sports.\" He may have been correct.<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Design and some art - Jesse Barksdale</p>\n<p>3D art and animation - Mikael Immonen</p>\n<p>Programming - Nestor K\u00f6hler</p>\n<p>Music - Saku K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:59:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/56632410210327c54b223455f166e64d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thewhalehusband"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
