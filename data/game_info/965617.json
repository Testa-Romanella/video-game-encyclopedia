{"id": 965617, "slug": "looper-tactics", "name": "Looper Tactics", "name_original": "Looper Tactics", "description": "Ages ago, mages and wisemen of the ancient Empire created a whole world, inhabited it with artificial souls, and put it within a box -- like a toy created for the delight of capricious gods. Eventually, they realized this world could bring their own destruction, wreaking havoc on the fabric of reality itself, so they sealed this world away in an eternal cycle of death and resurrection. You are determined to stop this cycle, to break away and gain freedom for you and your world -- even if that means you have to die uncountable times until you achieve it\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looper Tactics is an adventure card game that mixes deckbuilding and roguelike mechanics . You have a limited time to explore a procedurally generated world and face its enemies, traps, hazards and puzzles in increasingly difficult challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are free to explore the map however you like, advancing back and forth its tiles; eventually, the challenge becomes nigh impossible -- but death and failure bring a new start, allowing you to get stronger cards to build an increasingly powerful deck until you are ready to fight the ultimate battle for your freedom. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Build a powerful deck and go to battle summoning creatures and using items, scrolls, hero skills to defeat your opponents. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As you progress in the game repeating the cycle of exploration, defeat and resurrection, you will get more stronger cards with which you can freely build your own unique deck. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Death is part of your journey. Your hero\u2019s skills and cards can be upgraded, and every enhancement will be carried over new cycles until the end of the whole adventure. At some point you will be powerful enough to face the ultimate challenge and free yourself and your world of this illusory trap, of this eternal cycle of death and resurrection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T02:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb6fb69c7fe37f9dda7ada2eb0cb9112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["\u58a8\u9999\u5982\u6545"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2P Games", "Gamersky Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
