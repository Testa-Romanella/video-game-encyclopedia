There are multiple endings, about seven, however, there are some variants, making for about twelve different routes. Each route is dynamically timed to only take roughly a minute (Some are a couple seconds longer or shorter).</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy :)</p><p>(As a side note: This jam was really fun, especially the design stage. I ended up creating an entire tool to help me with making the routes. Here's a screenshot of the finished dialogue tree, if you're interested: https://imgur.com/a/MCLLgg0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a8871bdd7216a111c6f912fe924cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmeraldRailgun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
