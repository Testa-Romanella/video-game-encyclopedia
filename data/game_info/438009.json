Let's hope the next one is not due to something so horrible. Anyway, we were given a month, so this game amounts to about a month's worth of work. It's not going to be the best game ever; however, I\u00a0hope it is as fun to play as it was to make.</p>\r\nBackground / Setting\r\n<p>Isekai Demonica is about another possible, but unproven, victim of Bus-Kun, who is immediately anointed \"Demon King.\" Summoned into the world of demons, which is remarkably like medieval civilizations, the hero (villain?) must quickly deal with a Miasma. This Miasma created a chaotic mess, meaning the newly summoned\u00a0Demon King will have to slap down ghosts, other demons, dragons, and winged eye things(?) to clear out the Miasma that is turning people, err demons, into monsters.</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n<p><strong>Demon King:</strong> Not his real name of course, but he doesn't have one of those unless you give him one!</p>\n<p><strong>Cyne:</strong> A summoner demon who ganked someone into being king, nice!</p>\n<p><strong>Jeeves:</strong> A butler.. A ghost.. A former Demon King?</p>\n<p><strong>Fido</strong>: A dog. A dragon? A slot-machine?!</p>\r\nThis game has:\r\n<p>Saves!</p>\n<p>Gear!</p>\n<p>Jokes!</p>\n<p>C'mon down, and pay a visit to Demonica, where the demons need your help!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the short turn-around for making this game, there will likely be bugs even with my best effort to root them all out.\u00a0 The gameplay is completely not what was designed for RPG Maker, since this plays a bit more like a Zelda or a Y's type game than a Dragon Quest or Breath of Fire title.\u00a0 Due to the type of game running on the engine that it is - there are some quirks, like the \"pause\" screen is really an RPG's menu.</p><p><strong>Update rc1.0.1</strong></p><ul><li>On screen save points (just a reminder)</li><li>Toggle healthbar (player)</li><li>Fixed graphics glitch on a roof</li><li>Put in magically missing scene</li><li>Fixed broken lottery\u00a0</li><li>Changed stairs to give more maneuvering room</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Possible Updates:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Add pop-up health bar for player (requested)</li><li>Add pop-up health bar for enemies</li><li>Assigning a button to the \"recall\" item</li><li>Add Visual Save Points (will keep menu saves, requested)</li><li>Even more fixes to the combat mechanics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54c67f314251af604d9776945b2c217a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Failsauce GameWorks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
