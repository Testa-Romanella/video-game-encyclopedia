The first day was really difficult, I spent 4 hours in my computer screen trying to come up with a good idea based on the theme (Out of Control) and got nothing. When I was about to give up I thought of the situation that most people have no control over: Dating. <br/><br/>The game is supposed to be a sattire on how we view dating as something that we need to do things in a specific way so that we can succeed as if it were some kind of game, when in reality it's all out of our control and the only thing we can do is control ourselves and hope for the best.<br/><br/>The game has 4 different endings and everything was done by me from scratch. I hope you all like it!<br/><br/>Controls:</p><p>W - Forward</p><p>S - Backward</p><p>A - Left</p><p>D - Right</p><p>E - Up</p><p>Q - Down</p><p>Mouse - Look Around</p><p>LMB - Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f1/9f1e6727120b082a2dc3266a76bd6fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ramiro Almeida Basso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
