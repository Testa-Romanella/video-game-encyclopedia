He is informed that he will retire in 180 days. These 180 days are all that he has left to provide himself with a pension for the rest of his life. He needs to raise $ 500,000 for this. His family affairs are also not ideal. The wife went to another man, taking the children. On the other hand, the new prosecutor of his town, a young woman, demonstrates sympathy.<br />\nMayor of Freeburg is exactly the one who wants to fire the hero, it was he who determined the terms of his dismissal.<br />\nIn the city there are two mafia groups. And between them a war begins. The hero will have to understand his place in this game as well. For example, ignoring the call of the police, the hero can get money from the mafia.<br />\nThe hero&#39;s day begins with sending policemen to the tasks. Policemen can be more or less professional, more or less rested, they have different experiences, and sometimes suffer from alcoholism or have other shortcomings. At the beginning of the game the situation is simple, then complicate. The game depends strategically on the ability to make the best use of police forces. If you can manage the situation in the city under control, there is a chance to survive to retirement and retire with the capital in your pocket.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T05:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6cc/6cc68fa183b905ac9d85efb9797776f6.jpg", "website": "http://weappy-studio.com/titp/", "rating": 3.87, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 198, "owned": 2446, "beaten": 376, "toplay": 97, "dropped": 301, "playing": 51}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 684, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 687, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Handy Games", "Weappy Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "Nordic Games", "www.handy-games.com", "EuroVideo Medien"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
