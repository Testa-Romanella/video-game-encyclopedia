Once the mouse is released, the window will disappear.</p><p>If the symbol was recognized it will trigger an animation and change the design of the container. If the gesture was not recognized nothing will have changed and you can click the charge button to try again. </p><p>Once a container has a symbol inscribed on it, it is considered filled. Click it to move it back to the drawer. Once a container is filled, it cannot be changed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4cc62d7914b9d6531543b45d0f01d6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jackson Bowman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
