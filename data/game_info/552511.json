This is just enough to buy your first grave which you can use to harvest organs. By selling the organs you will receive money.</p>\n\n\n<p>Most of the things are handled by your workers automatically. If an organ appears they will go for it. Your job is to manage everything.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>So you decide which grave-slots to buy and also which of them will be filled. Besides that you also can buy more workers, healing and\u00a0upgrades. Of course everything is getting more and more expensive from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds easy, right? Well you are on a graveyard ... and of course there will be zombies! A zombie is the very last thing which spawns from your grave and after a couple of seconds it will become an empty grave again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zombies will wander around until they discover a worker. Then both will look for a fight. Be aware that zombies will become stronger over time! And you also should know that a worker holding an organ isn't able to fight. So he first will try to sell the organ. But the zombie of course will follow him.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da93d7d5fc1512b2f0e4bea203ca90a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
