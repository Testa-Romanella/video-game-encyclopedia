It will help me upgrade my system and have access to the major known engines. For now I'm stuck with an AMD a6 and 4gb of RAM. The lack of gpu prevents me from running Unity, Unreal and many heavier engines.<br/>Once I get enough resources, game making will help me and my family!<br/>Thank you for your support\u00a0 :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/456/45639e1720438e88e4788f5d28579488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adriano Silva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
