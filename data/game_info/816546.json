In this kingdom, there was a princess named Emih. She has great arcane potential within her, as her mother is the most powerful sorceress in the realm.</p>\n<p>When she turned 18, the year of Emih's coronation, frustration began to arise inside the princess's head: \"I will become queen, but my power does not even reach my mother's feet. How will I protect the kingdom, if I'm so weak? \".</p>\n<p>While strolling through the castle's corridors, Emih overhears two guards talking about a rumor. Apparently there was a ferocious creature, attacking the citizens of a neighboring kingdom. Such a creature had been summoned by cultists and had invaded the castle, destroying everything.</p>\n<p>Emih, then, decides to embark on this journey and face the creature alone to prove to everyone, including herself, that even though she doesn't have as much power as her mother, she can protect the kingdom from the dangers that sweep the continent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T06:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e3d7538b8a6275fdccac67d0201730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel Panza", "Jvssaa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
