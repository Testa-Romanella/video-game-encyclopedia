The Flashlight burns through the Vampires but you can use it only if Vampire attacks Civilian. The \"Hawkeye\"\u00a0marks Vampires for 5 seconds. To use it, you need to pay 50% of your blood and have 750 score points. The \"Vampire Pentagram\" kills every Vampire in Radius.\u00a0This is an Expensive Event, so you will pay 90% of your blood and 1500 score points. Also\u00a0don't forget to heal the Injured Civilian after killing Vampire or he will die.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> - <em>Move</em></li><li><strong>Mouse -\u00a0</strong><em>Camera</em></li><li><strong>F</strong> - <em>Flashlight</em></li><li><strong>E</strong> - <em>Ability \"Hawkeye\"</em></li><li><strong>Q </strong>- <em>Ability \"Vampire Pentagram\"</em></li><li><strong>R </strong>- <em>Heal </em><em>Civilians</em></li><li><strong>Escape -\u00a0</strong><em>Pause</em></li></ul>\r\nMade in 4 days for Mini Jam", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T17:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250ddf48504582172906d712d732927f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GREYM2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
