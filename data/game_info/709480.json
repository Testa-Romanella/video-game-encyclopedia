This game is similar to the game snake, but with some differences. Snake is a game where you have to collect balls\u00a0to get longer, and the more you get longer the more speed you get. You lose from colliding with yourself or going outside the map. These are the differences between my game and the original.</p>\n<p>- The game dimensions for this game are 30 x 30.</p>\n<p>- There are spikes.</p>\n<p>- There are random times you can die or get a point (this was not an intended feature).</p>\n<p>- You can go outside the map.</p>\n<p>- The character is a worm.</p>\n<p>- The powerup is a banana.</p>\n<p>New stuff adding soon:</p>\n<p>- A way to beat the game.</p>\n<p>- Music (the music is already in the files but not used).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/155/155529d030e3a27e8178566ee29e6072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["super026"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
