It was reworked as Robin Hood: Legend Quest in 1992 when it was also released for the Amiga and Atari ST.</p>\n<p>The Oliver twins developed the game for the Amstrad CPC when they were age 17; it and was their first game published by Codemasters. Codemasters offered the brothers \u00a310,000 for the game, because the company expected to sell 100,000 copies with royalties of 10p per unit sold. The twins worked on a single computer in a bedroom of their parents' house. Working in shifts, they coded for 18 to 23 hours per day; they took 30 minute breaks to allow the computer to cool. Sometimes, one brother coded on paper while the other used the computer.</p>\n<p>The game was well-received by critics, and sold well. After Codemasters asked the brothers to produce another game, they developed Ghost Hunters, which was released in February 1986.</p>\n<p>Codemasters reworked Super Robin Hood for the NES (also released on the four-in-one NES cartridge Quattro Adventure, published by Camerica in 1993). This reworked version was also released as Robin Hood: Legend Quest in 1992 and 1993 on both the 8-bit home computers the first game had been released on as well as 16-bit home computers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ecce0f43472b98c51f56bb5c61cddb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Oliver Twins", "The Oliver Twins"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
