According to the locals, the owner would offer visitors highly intriguing tapes, and that guests are guaranteed to leave with a great deal of insight into their own lives.</p>\r\n\r\nCONTENT WARNING [SPOILER]\r\nYou might find the theme disturbing.\r\n\r\n\n<strong>Jam</strong>\n<p><strong>Observer and the Observed</strong> was made in 5 days for the Wanderjahre Game Jam 3. The game follows two restrictions: <strong>No Text</strong> and <strong>Anagnorisis</strong>, which means the character has a moment of discovery that recontextualizes the narrative. Overall, this was a very challenging set of restrictions and I'm curious to know if you think I'm successful in delivering the anagnorisis.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Playing with the native build instead of the web version is highly recommended if you are experiencing performance issues.</strong></em><br/></p>\n<strong>Inspiration</strong>\n<p>The story for this jam entry is heavily inspired by the manga <em>Soumatoh Kabushikigaishac</em> by Sugawara Keita, also known by its English name, Revolving Lantern Corporation. The episodic manga tells the story of a company that offers customers DVDs containing a recording of their own life. These DVDs are in their perspective, often from birth to death. I ended up binging the 10 volumes of the manga over New Years and wanted to try my hand at making a short story with the same premise.</p>\n\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>The art and programming was done by me, Thuleanx. However, the game wouldn't be possible without the following free music:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Abstraction by Tallbear Studios [I know Ben is hosting an OST Game Jam on Jan 12th - Jan 30th.
