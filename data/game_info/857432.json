Original version: Ian Davison - Tynesoft Computer Software. Commodore 16/Plus4,\u00a01986. Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Miner Willy, intrepid explorer and nouveau-riche socialite, has been reaping the benefits of his fortune discovery in surbiton. He has a yacht, a cliff-top mansion, an Italian housekeeper and a French cook, and hundreds of new found friends who really know how to enjoy themselves at a party. His housekeeper, Maria, however, takes a very dim view of all his revellry, and finally after a particulary boisterous thrash she puts her foot down.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>When the last of the louts disappears down the drive in his Aston Martin, all Willy can think about is crashing out in his four-poster. But Maria wont let him into his room until all the discarded glasses and bottles have been cleared away. Can you help Willy out of his dilemma? He hasn\u2019t explored his mansion properly yet (it is a large place and he has been very busy) and there are some very strange things going on in the further recesses of the house (I wonder what the last owner was doing in his laboratory the night he disappeared.) You should manage O.K. though you will probably find some loonies have been up on the road and on the beach if I was you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck and don\u2019t worry.\u00a0\u00a0All you can lose in this game is sleep.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>A\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Cursor keys\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0A\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:</strong>\u00a0Z\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Arrow keys\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Jump:</strong>\u00a0Z\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Original game link (Plus4World)\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator (WLS) homepage link:\u00a0Jet Set Willy\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bc1b1fae0887948d44675e058fddc21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
