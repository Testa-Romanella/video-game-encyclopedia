{"id": 139005, "slug": "the-invisible-strings", "name": "The Invisible Strings", "name_original": "The Invisible Strings", "description": "<p><em>The Invisible Strings </em>is a short interactive audiovisual experience which hopes to speculate on the agency or lack thereof we possess in our existence.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is my fourth project for my Game Environments class at Parsons School of Design. For this particular project, the challenge was to make a VR project based on the idea of player possession.</p>\n<p>I chose to interpret this by making the project about how to make peace with the limited agency in our lives. While I strived to make the project as open to interpretation as possible, I wanted to vaguely imply that although we may not control what happens to us, we certainly may control how we perceive it.</p>\n<p>Although unintentional, a new constraint arrived in the form of the technical limitations of mobile as we were supposed to develop for Google Cardboard. I chose to tackle this constraint by making the experience having an animation film projected into all corners of the 3D space, creating a surreal atmosphere and also evoking feelings of passivity. The biggest challenge in the project was to create the animation film itself, where I had to manually create over 10,000 frames in order for me to complete my vision. While it remains to be seen that my project is a success or not, I was very satisfied to take on this challenge and having the opportunity to create a new project for a new medium.</p>\n<p>Since the original experience was built for Google Cardboard on mobile, the project has been remade into a computer compatible version featuring a 2D first person perspective for the itch platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS -</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use mouse to look around.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29e2df3a18f0fee323135a83414cf08c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tanish Karmakar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
