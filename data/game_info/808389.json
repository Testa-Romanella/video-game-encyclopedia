The storyline is: A research laboratory that does wild experiments on animals suddenly has to destroy the lab and all modified animals inside--by filling the entire facility with a deadly pink acid. You play as an animal on the top floor of the facility, within jumping distance of the exit, at least after you jump across the many anti-gravity platforms along the way that a helpful scientist left for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I interpret \"feral beast\" in this game as an aftermath of the plot. The animal in this game was born in a lab around humans, but after escaping the lab and going out into nature, that animal will then be a \"Feral Beast.\"\u00a0The game has only one ending.\u00a0There is only one sound FX, no music.</p>\n<p>I made this game in CopperCube, which has the Water FX option. The textures in the game are mine, but I've used them in other games before. The sound FX in this game is a sped-up sound from my previous game, but it's part of an old Sound FX I made a while ago of a loud wind storm sound.\u00a0There are two easter eggs--one is my logo, one is a reference to another one of my\u00a0games.</p>\n<p>Also, note, this game might be kind of hard?\u00a0 Ironically, I'm not really good at playing these kind of games, but I am able to beat this one, so maybe it isn't actually hard? Let me know either way.</p>\n<p>This game was made on June 20, 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11ded69a4c5bfc0418442ee0979721d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
