{"id": 611634, "slug": "qubo-2", "name": "qubo", "name_original": "qubo", "description": "qubo is a minimalist puzzle game that challenges you to reimagine space and perspective.<br/><br/>In qubo, you will explore a three-dimensional world from one of six two-dimensional views, revealing an astonishing interplay between two- and three-dimensional space. The premise is simple: move a set of 3D blocks to fit inside a 2D shape. As you progress, however, you will encounter impossible geometries and maddening complexity that will force you to abandon your previous notions of shape, perspective, and space. Are you up to the challenge?<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li> <strong>Simplicity</strong><br/>qubo\u2019s distinct art style was inspired by the minimalist artwork of James Turrell and Piet Mondrian.
