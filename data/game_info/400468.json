{"id": 400468, "slug": "moon-logic-emporium", "name": "Moon Logic Emporium", "name_original": "Moon Logic Emporium", "description": "<p>Moon Logic Emporium is a short point-and-click adventure game where your job is to test puzzles to ship to other point-and-click adventure games. In this situation, the puzzle wasn't finished and you've trapped poor Bobbie the puzzle mechanic in the puzzle with you. Fix the puzzle, make sure it works, and let your supervisor know that the puzzle is ready to ship! All from the comfort of home on your Moon Logic Emporium Test Terminal<strong><strong>\u2122</strong></strong>.</p>\n<p>This game is mouse driven. Click the buttons to select an action, and then click where you want to use that action. If something makes sense to the game, something will happen! Your goal,\u00a0<strong>if you don't want to figure it out</strong>, is to get Bobbie to hold the animal. This is Moon Logic Emporium, so expect at least one part of the puzzle to be a little outside logical thinking. HINT: Pay attention to Bobbie! She can't tell you exactly what to do most of the time, but she'll mention things that might point you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Moon Logic Emporium was created in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare Discord Jam #3 (#Djam3). The game was created using Godot 3.2 beta 4, and was designed to learn\u00a0the Godot system. (Quick and dirty) source is included. All audio, code and art was made during the 48 hour period (and actually it took me less than 24 hours total). The\u00a0music (or random plinking on a keyboard) was made possible using VST plugins from\u00a0DSK Music (http://dskmusic.com). Fonts used were Digit (http://dafont.com/digit.font) and Share-Tech Mono (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/2729efc61edd409458151adfb32cbcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
