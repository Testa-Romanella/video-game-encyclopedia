The roleplaying part is easy, you just have to think logically and focus on the story to chose the right path. But the minigame can be tricky so please read this before playing.</p>\n<p>The minigame is called<strong> \" Virus\"</strong>. You chose a symbol and the second player choses another symbol ( if it's in story mode, your symbol will be :) and the bot's simble will be ** by default.) The goal of the game is to fill out the board. Once it's filled, the one with the most symbols wins. Note that if your symbol is in one of the 4 corners, and you get corned<strong> DIAGONALLY</strong> by the opposing symbol, your symbol will be eaten and turned to an opposing symbol. IF your symbol is anywhere else on the board, if you are surrounded by opposing symbols forming a V shape around yours, your symobl will be eaten and turned to an opposing symbol. I know i'm not the best instructor, but i hope you at least have a good time playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>PS:You can write \"menu\" at any time to go back to the menu and switch between modes.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:34:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/05733abdbc1d48ac561d4b1007927aa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Livetoplay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
