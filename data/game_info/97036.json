{"id": 97036, "slug": "nocveil", "name": "Nocveil", "name_original": "Nocveil", "description": "<p>This game is nearing completion and is updated very regularly!\u00a0If you download and try out my game please give me some feedback on what to improve!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\tThe game takes inspiration from old 6th generation console games that place an emphasis on exploration, platforming, and puzzle solving. Some of which are Jack and Daxter, Rayman 2, and the classic Legend of Zelda series. While the world is smaller and the puzzles simple, Nocveil still hopes to capture the same adventurous feeling these games gave us so many years ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis game has different environments to explore, enemies and obstacles to avoid and battle, small puzzles to solve, mini dungeons to explore, puzzle minigames, raptor racing minigames, and a final boss battle. Being a small scale game, it doesn't sound like much, but I want to make a quality game rather than a large bug riddled mess.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs you explore the game, you'll find areas to play a minigame and the reward for completing the minigame is a bone. These bones are used to unlock new areas and continue on your mission. New areas will need to be explored and have small puzzles to solve and enemies to defeat before you can find one of your lost brethren.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you give it a download, feel free to tell me any thoughts you have, what you liked, what you would change, or how I can make it better. This game will be receiving updates as feedback is gathered; and thanks a ton for checking it out. <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b65f0b314787e42a12bd83ba599e6ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scylez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
