So, last year I created QLOW (https://br0ken-m1nd.itch.io/qlow-jam) for the lowrezjam on the last 3 hours due to not having time to before. Anyway, this year I\u00a0had the last 6 days to create a project, but I\u00a0only made use of the last 6 hours, for no reason at all. This game is very simple the as QLOW was.</p>\n<p>Also, this game was created using \"Singulair 64\" which is a Fantasy Console that I'm creating, this way I\u00a0was able to test the engine and all.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it XD\u00a0</p>\n<p>[OBJECTIVE]</p>\n<p>You need to jump to the squares that are static so the grid can go down. The concept is very simple.</p>\n<p>[WARNINGS]</p>\n<p>(You need java x86 installed, make sure you have x86 version installed).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b56da1dec60aa1209242cf67e6feea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["br0ken_m1nd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
