Order your myriad of children to explore, expand and exploit the Savannah, creating complex chains of resources on a procedurally generated map but remember that death demands a sacrifice and this tithe must always be paid...</p>\n<p>This game was created during the Global Game Jam 2023!<br/></p>\n<p>TUTORIAL:<br/>WASD / Mouse Drag - Movement<br/>Scrollwheel - Zoom</p>\n<p>Every turn you draw a new card from the stack, with its own range and pattern. Play it by first picking one of your mounts. Your options for expansion will then be indicated on the map, pick one. The path to them must not be blocked by any obstacles or other paths. You can then pick between 3 different production orders, based on the biome, for the new mount. These resources are produced anyway, but if their condition is met, a new card is added to the stack. If you run out of cards on the stack, the <em><strong>Termitnator</strong></em> will come, forcing you to pick exponentially rising numbers of your termite mounts for it to consume. <br/>Try to avoid running out of cards to keep this from happening. Sometimes placing mounts without the ability to complete them is useful to complete others.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:54:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b25de2b45e5c5e6d4ca179ad8864eec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xahutek"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
