Your goal is to complete as many games within your 3 lives as you can. I made this as my entry for the\u00a0Beginner's Circle Jam 4, and there's a grand total of.....7 microgames to play....</p>\n<p>\u00a0I definitely over scoped for my first game jam as I'm still learning the engine, so the game isn't quite where I'd like it to be, but I accomplished most of my learning goals with this jam. Probably going to enter with a team next time so I can focus on what I'm good at.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you to angrysmile for putting together this jam and the BCJ community\u00a0 for being\u00a0 friendly and welcoming to\u00a0beginner\u00a0game devs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T09:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/50413a4bc068afe4bf209676926e0ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RolyPolyCannoli"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
