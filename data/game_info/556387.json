It's meant to be a very minimal \"vertical slice\" of gameplay -- a little bit of everything, but none of it is very deep.

I couldn't have done it without help from these folks:</p>\n<ul><li>Shaun Spalding, for his action RPG tutorials that got me started</li><li>CanariGames and their excellent CanariPack assets</li><li>Lanea Zimmerman's Tiny 16 Basic tiles (for the NPCs)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/9676099af606f65a9e4d968b3036f79a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tallain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
