After growing tired of everlasting life and having grown older than time itself, the gods built a gigantic monolithic machine.This titan of a device was to take on their endless burden of soul sorting and allow them to die.<br />\nThis &quot;Hellscreen&quot; machine was soon constructed. But there was no rejoicing, only relief. In a flash, the old gods were gone, lost to time.</p>\n<p>After millennia of sorting countless souls, the machine begins to malfunction and displaces you.</p>\n<p>You are taken from the real world at the point of your death and deposited in the Hellscreen realm, instead of the peaceful afterlife you deserve.</p>\n<p>You are given an inhuman form and are called upon to destroy the machine and its infernal biome.<br />\nIt must be stopped from dismantling the fabric of all existence and destroying all reality and only you can stop it and reset order.</p>\n<p>Once this is done then perhaps you can return to your eternal resting spot.</p>\n<h1>EARLY ACCESS INFORMATION</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Episode 1 - Releases Q1 2023  </li>\n<li>Episode 2 - Releases mid 2023  </li>\n<li>Episode 3 - Releases Late 2023</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T08:00:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7a10a0bfc75d36ea18f7870dfc16ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 5, "toplay": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 434, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uk_resistant", "Jamie D"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jamie D"], "esrb_rating": null}
