On this island, life is played by the beat. Llamas only do something on each beat of the music. (They do be groovin tho)\u00a0Earn money every 4 beats that can make the llamas lives a little bit easier! Each island is procedural generated, so life is a little different each time you play. Have fun watching the llamas!</p><p>My Youtube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UAbwMZQdi0UyGTORL6zPw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/54195f165b022ec0ccd8fde0555f19e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["LlamaDev Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
