I wanted to make greater animations, and there is a lot of feedback missing yet.</p>\r\nPost Rush\r\n<p>The weekend was hard, as it was satisfactory. I did my best and now I am iterating over the same idea to make the game better.</p>\r\nFuture plans\r\n<p>I am planning to make a humorous story of this family. I enjoyed developing the game, and making the characters. There are a lot of stuff to do with a bizarre universe like this.</p>\r\nContact info\r\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/blackmoodgames</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-lanosa/\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BlackmoodGames</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/bluedaemonart/</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!!!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c023c1f48bf0e11fe5c9466e4f582c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Blackmood Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
