Now that I have some more 1337 c0d1ng sk|11z, I decided to see if I can't implement most of those mechanics in a week.</p>\n<p>The mechanics in question:<br/>- recursive body parts (works)<br/>- specialized body parts, including attacks (works)<br/>- turn-based mechanics respecting speed (easier than I thought)<br/>- ui system (works surprisingly well)<br/>- nested inventories (groundwork is there, but wouldn't have made it for the jam)<br/>- tissue layers (didn't even try :,)<br/></p>\n<p>It has the most basic graphics I could get away with (featuring a buggy FoV), \u00a0shitty AI, virtually nonexistent balance, almost no plot etc etc. The level generation is very basic and \"buggy\" - I found out that the overlapping rooms and corridors can actually make for a rather interesting level while taking effort AWAY from generation. I originally also intended to have procedurally generated enemies, but that also proved to be a rather bothersome rabbit hole that didn't make it into the jam. If you're expecting a fun little game to play, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting a tech demo and (messy) source code of the mechanics, however, you might find something you can use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f984d2b5919af950ebdb018950dc87a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ivykingsley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
