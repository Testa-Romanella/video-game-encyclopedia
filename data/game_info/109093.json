Actual game made over the course of two weeks. Mostly because I kept changing the color palette.\u00a0And then school stuff came up (even though we're in summer), and I had to stop working on this for like 3 days. Also I definitely clutched this. I may or may not update this after school starts. I am actually kind of nervous about posting this... but I worked hard on it, so...!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Also, feel free to give criticisms and suggestions and stuff. I'd really like to know if this was any good. \u00a0 \u00a0 o u o</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f23f2d18509c7990d58a6324bfc1d8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cheesecake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
