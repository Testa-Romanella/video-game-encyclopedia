The spaceship is rotated in another way: If the cursor is in the center of the screen (marked by the green crosshair), no rotation is applied. If you move the cursor outwards, towards the edge of the screen, your ship starts to rotate into that direction. The further outward the cursor is, the faster the rotation. Bring the cursor back over the crosshair to stop the roation.</p>\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>W/SMove forwards/backwardsA/DStrafe left/rightSpace/Left ShiftMove up/downMousePitch/YawQ/ERoll counter-clockwise/clockwiseLeft Mouse ButtonMining LaserRight Mouse ButtonLaunch/Explode BombFLaunch/Call back\u00a0Collector DroneXDock (when within range)TRadio Freighter\r\nAbout:<p>This game was created for the 32 Bit Jam 2022. I already wanted to use the Idea for last year's jam, but I did not have the time to participate. Therefore I tried to push myself even more this year. And I did. According to my Git log, I spend over 110 hours working on the game. To be added to this is the time Angelika Neumann spend with the voice recordings, as well as the time it took Unius to produce this sick beat for the credits &amp; trailer.</p><p>All in all I am pretty proud with how it turned out. Even though it is <strong>far</strong> from perfect, it is non the less the best game I've made so far. As always\u00a0I collected a lot of experience and tried out a ton of new tools. Among the latter are Blender, Docker and Git Hub Actions. This allowed me to setup a completely automated Continous Integration Pipeline, which I will use for every project from now on.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Programming &amp; Modeling: Sedetius</strong></li><li><strong>Instructor Voice:\u00a0Angelika Neumann (www.open-dance-experience.de)</strong></li><li><strong>Nostromo Voice:\u00a0Sedetius</strong></li><li><strong>Credits Music:\u00a0Unius</strong></li><li><strong>Space Ship Controller:\u00a0M4deM4n</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78ccc710df93e7def79e113706599927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sedetius"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
