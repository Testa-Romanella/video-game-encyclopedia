Either\u00a0fighter, blacksmith, tailor or other professions. They could then\u00a0trade the fruit of their labour with other players.\u00a0I think it would be an interesting experience, closer to mmos depicted in animes like Sword Art Online.</p>\n<p>Thank you for trying this prototype, don't hesitate to leave feedback or ideas in the comments !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/60158e609ab6eedeb4b95dad44d37bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zluu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
