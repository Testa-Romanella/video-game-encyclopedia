{"id": 815200, "slug": "islet-hell", "name": "Islet Hell", "name_original": "Islet Hell", "description": "This is a flight simulator in which you control a plane flying over a sea of small islands. The game is organized in a series of 10 levels of increasing difficulty. You have to shoot down all enemy planes and sink all enemy ships in order to win at each level. A radar at the bottom right of the screen allows you to locate all enemies as red dots with regard to your position, which is a black dot at the middle of the radar. Navigate the plane with the arrow keys in typical flight-simulator style: Left and Right for roll and Up and Down for pitch motion. Shoot with the space-bar. That is all! You have no bombs so you have to sink ships by simply shooting at them. However, they can fire missiles at you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T04:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0c462d99571f0cad47c8c295afd9ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["dimi309"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["dimi309"], "esrb_rating": null}
