I'm relatively new to game development and this is my first piece of work that I\u00a0actually feel confident enough to share!</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>CLOUD is a relaxing game in which you play as Nimbus, a fluffy fellow who has dreams and aspirations to journey far across the galaxy. To do so, you must help him collect fluff across different planets and moons, whilst avoiding a variety of different environmental obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>The current build lets you collect fluff on earth, which can be used to upgrade Nimbus' initial speed. As the game progresses, you'll encounter more and more storm clouds, which must be avoided. But fear not! If Nimbus manages to stumble across and exciting neon blue cloud, he'll be able to blow up those pesky storms!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- WASD or arrow keys to move</p>\n<p><strong>Have fun playing!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Slow Motion -\u00a0https://www.bensound.com</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Dubbish - keinzweiter http://spontan-musik.de</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd1fb78679d9d1b9e9a46761cc07651d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["latheus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
