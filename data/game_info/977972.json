This is Ulti, the official card game of the world of <strong>Behind the Beyond</strong> (...and Hungary too).<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as Jancsi, the protagonist of Behind the Beyond. After learning the rules from your host, Zsuzsi, you can set yourself against the best Ulti players of your village! Or jump in head-first without a tutorial - we\u2019re not judging.<br/><br/>In its core, Behind the Beyond: Ulti is exactly the same great card game that you can play with select characters in Behind the Beyond. It has the same logic and the same opponents, but we made this shiny new second home for it, so you can play Ulti on its own. We also added some cool features like stats and achievements.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t worry, playing Behind the Beyond: Ulti won\u2019t spoil the story of the main game!<br/><br/>Behind the Beyond: Ulti is feature-complete and includes all currently available opponents from Behind the Beyond.<br/>Should we change anything in the Ulti game within Behind the Beyond, we will make the same changes here too.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T09:46:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48dd8193cf62da6f9eecd7910bf9a6e.jpg", "website": "https://behindthebeyond.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sugarpunch Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sugarpunch Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
