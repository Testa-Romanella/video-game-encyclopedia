{"id": 857711, "slug": "good-bear", "name": "Good Bear", "name_original": "Good Bear", "description": "Good Bear is inspired by the infotainment, adventure, and first person games of the 1990's and early 2000's. It is separated into different stages and uses a series of mini-games to explore a world and become familiar with its inhabitants. These mini-games are casual-style puzzles that are meant to be easy to pick up and play. Once the player delves into these, they are able to get closer and closer to the characters, and eventually, take control of them and explore the world. There are items, environments, and interactions that you can only discover through these first-person sections, but it is also possible to completely ignore them and complete the game. The world itself has additional areas, characters, hazards and interactive elements to explore. Instead of a single linear path, the game offers a variety of choices that allow the player to discover different things and have different game-play experiences though repeated play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T05:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f418b66a3020fcd5d34d9aa8ce8c5d16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Little Spectre"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Little Spectre"], "esrb_rating": null}
