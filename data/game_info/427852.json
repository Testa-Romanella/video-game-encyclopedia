No enemies, no bullets, no lasers, no audio. Just sheer platforming.<br/><br/>Micro Platformer is a seriously minimalistic 2D platformer. A 1x1 tileset and a small square is not just a part of the artwork, it's a way to tell you exactly what the hitboxes are. Why? Well, there are quite a few difficulity levels. Some of them are not easy. At all. I wanted this game to be the simplest platformer I could possibly make, without making it empty, or easy. Did I do a good job? Well, one way to find out! c: Oh yeah, the classic feature listing.
