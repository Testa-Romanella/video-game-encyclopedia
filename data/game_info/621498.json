You have to juggle controlling two different characters - with entirely different control schemes - at the same time! In addition, the Jumper ki-blasting martial artist can only kill blue spiders... while the cyborg Gunner can only shoot red wasps! Ikaruga meets Knuckles Chaotix meets Star Fox Zero... wait... only one of these games was good... :P</p>\n<p>Well I hope I did it better, lol.</p>\n<p>All music is royalty free so dw about streaming.<br/></p>\n<p>ATTRIBUTION:</p>\n<p>Spider by Stephen \"Redshrike\" Challener as graphic artist and William.Thompsonj as contributor. https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-spider</p>\n<p>OpenGunner sprites by Master 484 modified by me - https://opengameart.org/users/master484 https://m484games.ucoz.com/ https://opengameart.org/content/open-gunner-starter-kit</p>\n<p>Beast Soldier tileset by Surt https://opengameart.org/content/beast-soldier</p>\n<p>Platformer Base by Miguel Duarte - https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-base<br/></p>\n<p>Bitmap font by CruzR - https://opengameart.org/content/16x12-terminal-bitmap-font</p>\n<p>Water Magic projectile by Cethiel - https://opengameart.org/content/water-magic-effect</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Voxel Revolution by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7017-voxel-revolution</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Cyborg Dance by Joel Loopez</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7412-cyborg-dance</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Lan Party by Musikhalde</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7107-lan-party</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Mega Hyper Ultrastorm by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/4033-mega-hyper-ultrastorm</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Cyborg Ninja by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/3577-cyborg-ninja</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>We Love Commondore by Frank Schr\u00f6ter</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7794-we-love-commondore</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>jump03.wav by Sharesynth on Freesound - Gunner jump sound</p>\n<p>Hurt05.wav by Sharesynth on Freesound - Gunner Fire sound</p>\n<p>Laser04.wav by Sharesynth on Freesound - Jumper jump/shoot sound</p>\n<p>explosion04.wav by Sharesynth on Freesound - death sound</p>\n<p>hurt04.wav by Sharesynth on Freesound - player death sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d870b40cfe0ac4741ce49ab055cf0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deerstalker Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
