The objective is to avoid getting captured by the iBots by moving your spaceman to a safe location. This game is turn based, meaning, you take a turn and then the iBots will take a turn. It is played similar to how you play Chess.<br/><br/>The first wave of iBots are not intelligent. They simply plot a course directly to you and move in that direction. If an obstruction is in the way they will be destroyed. As the game progresses their intelligence will increase. They will learn how to avoid obstacles on their way to capture you.<br/><br/>Use special pickups that randomly appear to help you defeat the iBots.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1abc04193fbec2f902e941ba2afa956_NudyhrK.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Les Bird"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Les Bird"], "esrb_rating": null}
