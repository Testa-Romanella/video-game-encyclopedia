In Robo Racket, evil robots are on the loose. It's up to you and a friend to kill them in this Space Invaders inspired game. Together, you both control a single turret which can be used to kill the evil robots. Be careful that they do not attack your core, as it is your only means of staying alive.\u00a0 Playing with 2 players is HIGHLY recommended.</p>\n\n<p>----CONTROLS</p>\n<p>PLAYER1</p>\n<p>WASD</p>\n<p>PLAYER2</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/9850f3f446d88dfca7726a52a1beafa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blockycow"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
