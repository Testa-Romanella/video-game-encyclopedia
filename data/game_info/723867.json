The terminology and  mechanics are borrowed from mathematical graph theory.<br/></p>\n<p>A Vertex is a narrative focus. It can be any shape. It can be a  structure, object, location, person or anything else your players might  interact with.</p>\n<p>An Edge is the connection between nodes.\u00a0It can\u00a0appear\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0line\u00a0on\u00a0a Marauder\u00a0map.\r\n     </p>\n<p>The position of a Vertex or an Edge on a Marauder map is not relative  to their actual position. A Vertex representing a capital city can be  next to a Vertex representing a village on the opposite side of the  world. Use Weights to indicate things like distance. <br/></p><p>    A full-featured example Marauder map is forthcoming.</p>\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n<p>You are free to:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Share </strong>\u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Adapt </strong>- remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.<br/></p>\n<p>Under the following terms:</p>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong> \u2014 You must give appropriate credit.
