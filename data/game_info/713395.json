I don't know! But what I\u00a0do know is something isn't right. Mario is going to have to get to the bottom of this. Looks like Mario can create boxes to traverse this admittedly short game, but they break under the pressure of other boxes. Maybe he can use that to his advantage too.\u00a0 But Mario has to be smart, he only has a limited amount of boxes that can be out at a time. If he can find a mushroom somewhere, he might be able to use more.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/></p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Hold Shif + WASD - Spawn blocks</p>\n<p>Control - Throw Blocks</p>\n<p>Q - Destroy bock</p>\n<p>F - Transport through blocks</p>\n\n<p>Note: If Mario gets stuck somehow, press shift, and that should fix it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea715b4e3a4f53835da5120a183e5d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Superpig5246"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
