Blick Block will make you think twice before you swipe!</p>\n<p>Blick Block is simple at first but master the shifting blocks and it becomes a game of strategy beyond your traditional Match-3.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of Blick Block is to get the highest score possible by shifting the blocks around the board, making connections, and than clearing those connecting blocks. The larger the connections, the more points you will get! Sounds simple? Here's the catch; in Blick Block when you swipe, the whole line moves! The end pieces simply wrap around the board. Mastering the swipe and predicting where your blocks will end up is how you'll become an expert!</p>\n<p>There are 4 different modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Strategy: Get the highest score in 60 moves</li><li>Rush: Get the highest score in 60 seconds</li><li>Survive: You can gain moves for large connections, but lose moves for small ones. Think twice before you swipe!</li><li>Endless: Unlimited time and moves</li></ul>\n<p>Blick Block has a pattern setting to enhance the gameplay for colorblind individuals. Upon enabling patterns within the settings menu, the blocks will maintain their color, but each color will also have a unique pattern.</p>\n\n<p>*** Supported Languages ***</p>\n<ul><li>English\u00a0</li><li>Fran\u00e7ais\u00a0</li><li>Espa\u00f1ol\u00a0</li><li>Italiano\u00a0</li><li>Polski\u00a0</li><li>Svenska\u00a0</li><li>Latvie\u0161u\u00a0</li><li>Deutsch</li></ul>\n<p>Youtube:</p>\n<p>Developer information:<br/></p>\n<p>Bus Stop Studios</p>\n<p>@Busstopstudios<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:58:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006b74917eef2e8778571e8e44c5df1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bus Stop Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
