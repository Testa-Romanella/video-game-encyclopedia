You play as a student of Horace\u2019s Magical School of Acrobatic Arts, the most famous circus school in your city. Even though it\u2019s produced renowned artists for decades, little is known about the school\u2019s founder, Horace Winterson. Years ago, he ran a theme park called Magical Fun House of Horace before vanishing in mysterious circumstances. Since then, the theme park sits empty and forgotten. Some old students say there\u2019s valuable knowledge to be found in the old founder\u2019s office at the theme park \u2013 books on how to perform special tricks and improve your performance. After an injury, you set out to explore the theme park after dark in an attempt to find the knowledge you need to heal. But in the thick of the night, you realise you\u2019re no longer alone. Use your torch to navigate the dark, overcome obstacles, and find your way out of the theme park before you become a part of Horace\u2019s Little House of Horrors forever\u2026 <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Evade the monstrous Horace in this short 2D top-down stealth game</li><li>Outwit the enemy by using your torch strategically</li><li>Enjoy 2D art along with a creepy soundtrack.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>Peter Armstrong \u2014 Programmer\r\n </p>\n<p>Faris \u2014 Programmer\r\n </p>\n<p>Sarah Jean Strachan \u2014 Music &amp; Audio www.sjsmusic.com.au\r\n </p>\n<p>Lise Leitner \u2014 Writing and Narrative\r\n </p>\n<p>Nate Ivanoff \u2014 Artist\r\n </p>\n<p>Dan Pieri \u2014Artist\r\n </p>\n<p>Vittoria Zagari \u2014 Artist\r\n \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T03:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5b/b5bbcadcbea5b283341d9597ad921907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lisekarel", "Sarah_jean"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
