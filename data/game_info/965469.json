This one was unique, in that it was 2 projects rolled into one! The KAWAIII segment had everyone make a level in a month, like the normal SUGOI affair. Afterwards, the KIMOIII segment had everyone make a boss battle in a month. As per SUGOI tradition, they have all been packaged into a single game, with hub levels, final bosses, and a dumb plot tying everything together. I cannot even begin to express my gratitude toward the SRB2 community into words for coming together to create possibly one of the largest SRB2 mods ever. None of this would&#39;ve been possible without the absolutely insane number of contributions I received!</p>\n<p>Now, for your normally scheduled marketing fluff:</p>\n<pre><code>56 levels. Yes, fifty-six. That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;modest&amp;quot; count.  \nA collaboration between 62 people!  \nOriginal music provided by AxelMoon and Lach!
