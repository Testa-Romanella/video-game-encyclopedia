{"id": 441056, "slug": "totally-shmup", "name": "Totally Shmup (itch)", "name_original": "Totally Shmup (itch)", "description": "<p>The idea behind Totally Shmup is to create a Shmup where you travel from planet to planet saving the inhabitants. The game will switch between vertical (space travel), multi-directional (above planet) and horizontal (flying across the planet). The aim is to make each playthrough different by having enemies appear in randomly chosen waves.</p>\n<p>Currently in very early development. I'm working on finishing the Vertical stages (see Roadmap below)\u00a0before moving on to the multi-directional and finally horizontal stages.\u00a0</p>\r\nVersion 0.1.1\r\n<p>Changed background colours to make enemies stand out more<br/>Spirits now white to differentiate between the enemies you can and cannot shoot<br/>Level icons moved and lowered amount of XP needed to lvl up.<br/>Health now regens after shield is down.<br/>Tutorial now ends with the player losing their weapons from a missile attack.<br/>Fixed the eyes on the portrait :-)<br/>Bug Fix: Rare crash when Player dies. Shouldn't happen again - hopefully.</p>\r\nVersion 0.1.0\r\n<p>Basic vertical shmup engine<br/>Set and random waves (1st is set &gt; random 1/3 &gt; random 1/3 &gt; 3 set waves)<br/>Random choice of backgrounds (not animated yet)<br/>Tutorial<br/>Keyboard and Mouse Movement</p>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>0.1.2 - 3 Bosses. Random 1/3 last waves. Checkpoints after bosses. Bug fix: Show hitboxes not working.<br/>0.1.3 - Screen Clearing Weapon. Tighten waves and gaps. Animations + Effects.<br/>0.1.4 - Sounds and Music.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming and Art: EldTheZombie<br/>Testers: Aba, Dragonsworn, Nini and Sir Ant<br/>Engine: Godot<br/>OS: Debian<br/>Tools: Aseprite, G.I.M.P.<br/>Also big thanks to the help from the Godot Engine Discord<br/>Font: SFPixelate (Shyonts - Dafont.com - Free for Personal Use)</p>\r\nContact\r\n<p>Twitter: @EldTheZombie<br/>Email: eld@thezombie.co.uk<br/>Website: eldthezombie.carrd.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6ee050dafb2ecb2c185d8c108a7feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["EldTheZombie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
