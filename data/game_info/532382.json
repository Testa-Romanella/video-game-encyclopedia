Verbal coaching is provided in the correct P-A-S-S method of using a fire extinguisher. Participants will also utilize basic fire prevention techniques that can often be implemented to reduce the likelihood of a fire occurring. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEven though an employee's response to a fire will always be based on their employer's policies, procedures, and the employee's level of training... this simulator can be used as a training supplement to fill in gaps in bland or vague fire prevention training programs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T02:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/731f85e70017c1c35302c1f27536c082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrick Kelley, CIT", "Derek Baker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kelley Integrity Safety Solutions"], "esrb_rating": null}
