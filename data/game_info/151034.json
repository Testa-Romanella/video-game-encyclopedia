You will have to deflect the numerous hordes attacking who want to destroy your fortress, but they will be pissed off by the power of your Attaking Words.</p>\n<p>In Paper Defense there will be game modes to learn typewritting (execises like type \"asdf\"...), story mode (where your words comes alive in the screen) and challenge mode (who will be the Keyboard King?). A World Hi-scores list will be shared.</p>\n<p>The game final version would have several scenes (aliens attack, zombie apocalipsis,...), several languages dictionaries, power-ups, skills and experince system for the defender and a 2-player on-line mode (one create the enemies and the other defend the fortress).</p>\n<p>The idea arrives when I saw my childrens watching youtube videos and browsing Internet using only two fingers to type the keyboard. I realice that their creativity went down with this behaviour, so I propose to make a videogame in family (they will make the graphics and stories) to know that their ideas can became a reality.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Settings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can tune velocidad (speed) , timeSpawn, caseSensitive and other things in the data/config.properties file.
