There will probably be minor bugs.<br/>We opted out of the \"Graphics category\" because we used some base assets to start the game as well textures built into unreal engine. Most of the assets have been changed beyond recognition except for some of textures.<br/>Some sound assets were used for sound fx, however they have been cut up, changed, pitched and modified beyond recognition. Music is all original.<br/>If you find issues or have questions, feel free to contact us: info at virtuaworlds.io.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>**** KNOWN ISSUES ****</p>\n<p>Sometimes the bucket flies into the air.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the background music doesn't stop when the game over music plays. <br/>Ragdoll effects not working. <br/>Background music may stop. <br/>Menus do not work with the keyboard. Use the mouse. <br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>****ASSETS AND TOOLS****</p>\n<p>See README.TXT.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
