Over the course of 2 levels, you get to learn intuitive techniques to traverse the course more efficiently. The game gives you a decent amount of freedom to defeat enemies and jump across obstacles.</p><p>Impetus was created for our big, last school project and is the first game I've ever created. It lacks in some areas - some of the GUI stuff is a little wonky - but it was fun working on it and it got some good reception! If you have some time to invest, you can get a decent amount out of it. Have fun exploring those options!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13a/13a623e38917bfa020a4f9d11bd4c356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["wandmeister"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
