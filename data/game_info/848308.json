For the month of September 2022, I issued a challenge to myself to make 1 game a week. The catch is that it has to be made a randomly selected gameplay in a randomly selected game engine. This game was built in GameMaker studios and\u00a0the gameplay is an endless shooter/ wave shooter type game. Let me know in the comments what you think of the game and you can catch me on twitch @https://www.twitch.tv/greencyberninjax\u00a0 where I streamed the entire development of this game.</p>\r\nThank you for playing!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T21:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb91a7d74cc6185ab416649ef4cff1a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArgyleSandpaperStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
