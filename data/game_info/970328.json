This VR first-person shooter has you defeat enemies using weapons you find scattered around the environment as you travel to the level's end objective. Move by throwing orbs that teleport you to the place where they land. Levels offer little cover from enemy attacks, resulting in an active combat experience with constant movement. <br/><br/>Use your inventory to store items and equip them instantly. Weapons display their remaining ammo, so you always know how close you are to reloading. You have a limited amount of health which is displayed on your hands and you can heal by using heart items. Some levels are boss battles where you will need to defeat a very powerful enemy by finding and exploiting its weakness. <br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Fast-Pace Teleport Movement<br/></li><li> Unique Weapons and Items<br/></li><li> Easy-to-Use Inventory<br/></li><li> Challenging Boss Battles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T07:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f6c258ff0e9b55529303f98d4ba0176.jpg", "website": "https://hnzkstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HNZK"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HNZK"], "esrb_rating": null}
