The engine offers 20 levels of difficulty. Be aware that, for beginners, it can took some time to win a single game even at the lowest level (ELO ranked at approx. 1300). The highest level is, well, the state-of-art of chess A.I. so yeah.</p>\n<p>If you have found any bug, please let me know!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>My main goal at first was to learn some low level game development, so this game is a proof-of-concept of my made-from-scratch engine (C++/Lua). I can't recommend anyone to use it, as it isn't properly documented, but if you wanna try even yet\u00a0to sharpen your C++ programming/building skills, contact me and I'll gladly help you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T09:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6258f11f08696b66c284102b4346bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rilpires"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
