I prefer to think ignorance is attack without warning. The world needs to be ruled by one single ruler, that everyone may be in coordination. Such was promised me when I was a young child. What do you think?\"</p><p>World War Ages is not even in Pre-Alpha. The walking took hours to polish, so it'll be a while until everything is set into full story motion. The game will be about you attempting to take over the world. The scene you may imagine is a bloody, gory scene, but that's not going to be the case. This game will be totally SFW, and hopefully E10+ as there's no possible way to make war into an E rated game.</p><p>For now, though, we're keeping the full story in close containment, so you won't understand anything unless you are a SUPER hardcore theorist.</p><p>[-] v0.0.1:</p><p>-Implemented polished walking</p><p>-Made graphics for the ground and player objects.</p><p>[-] v0.0.2:</p><p>-Implemented a basic attack system (Currently SPACE for attack)</p><p>-Implemented sprinting (You can run infinitely with no stamina being implemented (yet)...)</p><p>-You can press 1 for true fullscreen mode.</p><p>[x] v0.03 (<strong>NOT OUT YET</strong>):</p><p>-Adding enemy (Maybe?)</p><p>-Adding gamepad support (You'll have to test that.)</p><p>-There's currently a typo in one of the files.
