A lot of the art is inspired by Danganronpa and anime in general. I do apologize for the rushed drawings, this originally was for an English project and I had only a week to finish it. I've used a lot of references to speed up the process. It's more a game I made for fun than something serious, I never intended to make money out of it.</p>\n<p>Please download all files and put them together in a folder!\u00a0</p>\n<p> \u00a0<br/>I hope you enjoy the game^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c143e849d5971874dcb406ce3153716f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ice_needs_therapy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
