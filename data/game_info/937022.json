So, in order to play, you must unlock the file.</p>\n<p><strong>- Category: \"Quiz\"</strong></p>\n<p>It simply consists of guessing the game, only listening to a characteristic sound of it. I hope you like it ^^</p>\n<p><strong>- Game content:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>You will start with 3 lives and infinite time.\u00a0When making a COMBO of 5, you will receive a heart. If you make a mistake or omit you will lose a heart. Only when you make a mistake, you will be able to occupy the track.\u00a0 The sounds appear randomly and some are repeated.\u00a0 I will add more sounds soon. ^^</p>\n<p>*If you have any suggestion, also feel free to tell me ^^</p>\n<p>* The game is saved, when you exit from the menu (So, I recommend you not to change the file name, and not to exit the game with the Esc key.)</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, or have problems downloading it, feel free to tell me in the comments. Thanks ^^</p>\n<p>Contact me on Instagram and\u00a0visit my Youtube channel.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T22:49:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb8e1f8278a060a18be8faa31968dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Litygames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
