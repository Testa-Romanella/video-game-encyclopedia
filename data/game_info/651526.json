On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.<br/><br/>The game features play for 3-7 players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8e74a24abdbb4ec27ded58350bfdf2_8SScsfm.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["dtda games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["DTDA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
