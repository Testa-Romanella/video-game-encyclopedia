The events that unfold within this game are opposite to our reality, or whatever I have to say to avoid being reprimanded.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You are a pilot who has drunk so much beer that you've begun hallucinating rings in the sky. It's your duty to fly through them! Or into them, rather \u2013 they're kinda small.\u00a0With reckless enough flying, your passengers can effectively experience zero gravity!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Your mouse, touchscreen, touchpad, graphics tablet, telepathy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0whatever you've got!</p>\n<p>If you want to go full screen, get ready to click the button (bottom-right) while the game is loading,\u00a0Clicking full screen buttons whilst flying is dangerous!</p>\r\nCompatibility\r\n<p>Should work fine on any up-to-date copy of Chrome or Firefox, or derivatives of those browsers, on PC.</p>\n<p>This game is probably compatible with Android smartphones (it lags on mine, but mine is old). Doesn't work properly on iOS because that's iOS.</p>\n<p>This is a jam game, and with that comes jam code. If the plane freaks out, you're probably running at an uncapped frame rate. Don't do that. Going beyond 420fps is not a good idea. That number's not a joke\u00a0\u2013 it's the highest safe multiple of 60 I\u00a0could find</p>\r\nBehind the scenes\r\n<p>There's not too much going on here. libGDX, Box2D and gdx-video. But I did write some JavaScript to adjust volume etc. on-the-<em>fly</em>, and for looped sound to even work at all on Firefox. The sound department isn't really libGDX's strong suit.</p>\r\nLegal\r\n<p>This game is not authored or sponsored by libGDX, or raeleus for that matter. Hope they don't mind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T11:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e78a90b2e6bf846adb8af1ae8d18872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["James", "Java Cake Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
