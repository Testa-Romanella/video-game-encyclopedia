Bijou witnesses a rainbow, which disappears as a Prince named Bo falls to the ground. The Prince states that he can make rainbows by using his umbrella, but discovers that his umbrella has lost its power due to losing its colors. Hamtaro goes to collect things of the proper color for Bo to use to power his umbrella and make the rainbow reappear. Certain minigames are needed to reach the colors, and players must have certain Ham-Hams in their party in order to play them. There are more than 100 minigames in Rainbow Rescue.&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T15:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d395ba1cc4cbe35ec8499c2cf6a3a65d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Alpha Dream"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
