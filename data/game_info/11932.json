Instead of large explosions and powerful guns, you will rely on your cunning to survive puzzles in an incredibly detailed world. As you travel through the infrastructure of a city you will find that your actions and thorough observations ultimately determine if others will survive. A society obsessed with upgradation has brought a disaster upon itself and it is your job to help restore it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T02:01:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/753/753093303c30b95ff5be8bdddf090cce.jpg", "website": "http://infragame.net", "rating": 3.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 296, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 15, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 522, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 28, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loiste Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Loiste Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
