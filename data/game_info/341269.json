Now that I look at it, it's mostly finished. I've just never considered it being polished enough, I guess. Thanks to the Fragment Jam for encouraging me to finally release it.</em></p>\n<p>The game plays like\u00a0<em>Achtung, die Kurve!</em> (aka\u00a0<em>Curve Fever</em>), except the playing field is circular and rotates. Players draw lines, trying to avoid collision with any drawn line or boundary. Occasionally, they leave gaps in their lines. The disk will rotate faster and faster.</p>\n<p>Use mouse in the menu and keyboard to play.\u00a0You might hit the limit of key presses\u00a0for your keyboard with many players. Press F4 to toggle fullscreen.</p>\n<p>Game is made with L\u00d6VE framework, version 0.10.2. I made a Windows build, but you can play on other systems if you install L\u00d6VE and run the .love file. Unfortunately, this game requires friends to play and test.\u00a0To get around it, I've created a shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D) which makes the next round start only after all of the players have died.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50c/50ce1a4a22acb55c5dbd4618edb5f72b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iszn_11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
