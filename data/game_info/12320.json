{"id": 12320, "slug": "prison-architect-all-day-and-a-psych", "name": "Prison Architect", "name_original": "Prison Architect", "description": "<p>Prison Architect is a person construction and management simulator developed by Introversion Software.</p>\n<p>It is a two-dimensional top-down simulator where it is the player&#39;s responsibility to build new prison blocks, cells, facilities, manage the staff such as wardens, guards and so on. The more staff hired - the more options does the player have while building the prison.</p>\n<p>It is advised to complete the game&#39;s campaign first which also serves as a tutorial and consists of 5 parts. Each part of the campaign focuses on two game aspects and has its&#39; own story told with Polaroid photos. The player can&#39;t lose the game in campaign mode as there are no failure conditions whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Two more modes are present: Sandbox Mode and Escape Mode. There is no main goal in Sandbox Mode, so you basically can&#39;t win the game, but there are several failure conditions such as a riot or bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Escape Mode, on the other hand, has both winning and losing conditions. In this mode, you play as a prisoner making their escape causing the most destruction on your way out. Escape Mode starts automatically if you allow too many deaths in a short period of time in Sandbox Mode.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2015-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6bc/6bc79f5bc023b1e6938f6eaf9926f073.jpg", "website": "http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 320, "owned": 4296, "beaten": 190, "toplay": 55, "dropped": 403, "playing": 43}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 569, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 569, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Double Eleven", "Introversion Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Introversion Software"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
