Stop swinging the umbrella in order to use it as a shield.<br/><br/>There is no win condition, just see how long you can last.<br/>If you manage to live through all of the wave patterns, they repeat but at a higher frequency.<br/><br/>Sorry that it's hard, I didn't spend enough time on balancing.<br/><br/>Tips: enemies are briefly stunned when they take damage. You can kill the melee enemies without taking damage by attacking while running away from them. It's probably worth taking a single hit in order to take out a ranged enemy faster, since you die by being overrun more often than by taking small amounts of damage many times.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T14:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb12385e523415351c1d392588d6eb9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Almost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
