This time, our demon-hunting involves some kind of an old mansion with a creepy secret within its basement. Classic murder story ensues and we have to solve it before more people die! With the help of my schoolmates, a quirky biologist, and a creepy couple I know nothing about, I\u2019m going to solve my first murder case! But wait, Gerald\u2019s acting kind of weird lately. For a guy who has three different personalities, he is definitely not normal, but he's never THIS weird.
