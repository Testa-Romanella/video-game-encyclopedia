This is a time before humans, this was a time of magic and fantasy, mythical creatures wander this land, elves, orcs, dwarves, and more. News has spread that an evil angel has come forth to destroy the land. As an orc with honour, you heard this news and decided to do something about it. Grabbing your trusty blade, you head out to kick their ass.<br/><br/>You grow stronger over time, and equipped with your ego sword, so will your blade. Watch as it grows with your level!<br/><br/>Find items along your path to justice to help in your crusade. You are not a caveman. You have technology! (Disclaimer: This game has no technology)<br/><br/>While the path is linear, you don't have to be. Be the orc you want to be, and grow as you like. Be the orc you wanna be! (Disclaimer: Orcs are very basic creatures, and there are rarely many differences between them. Some say they are identical. Other's are in denial)<br/></p>\n\n<p>===DISCLAIMER===\r\n </p>\n<p>Pangea was released in June and as such has received little attention in terms of development. Due to college life, neither me or my associate could find the time to work on it. However, plans have been put in place to potentially revive and work on the project more so that it can reach it's full potential.<br/>FEEDBACK IS THE MOST VALUABLE  THING YOU CAN GIVE US!! <br/></p>\n<p>Also, disregard the fact the file is called feature test. This was an executive decision on our part because we felt this represented the true meaning and spirit behind the game.<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move\r\n </p>\n<p>1, 2, 3 - Switches between weapons<br/></p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint\r\n </p>\n<p>Lmb - Use equipped item\r\n </p>\n<p>Escape/ F4 - Exit <br/></p>\n<p>R -\u00a0Restart\r\n </p>\n<p>E - Pick up arrows\r\n </p>\n<p>Z - Eat Health fish<br/></p>\n<p>X - Eat Mana fish</p>\n<p>C - Eat Stamina fish<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/258/258f066a1a048f73cadf6778c5f396f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dead Tired"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
