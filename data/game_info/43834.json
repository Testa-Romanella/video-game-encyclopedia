Ok, now, gather around, because I\u2019m about to tell you something. The rest of you can just enjoy this experience, because there is nothing I can tell you to make you even more interested. It\u2019s just a \u201cdream come true\u201d for all of us, right?<br />\nGold Rush allows you to discover the tough experience of gold mining. You start with just an excavator, but with passing seasons, you become the wealthiest man in Alaska.<br />\nWe created a big, detailed world with four unique gold mining claims. On each, you will find a fully deformable terrain. Each fragment of our world has its own background story you can discover in spare time.<br />\nOur main goal was to create a high-fidelity simulation. You will spend a lot of time in the excavator, as it is the main gold mining tool, so with that in mind, we spend the majority of our time giving you the best possible experience.<br />\nThere is no campaign in our game. Instead, we decided, after a long tutorial, you will go into Sandbox mode, where you will not be constrained by anything.<br />\nRemember, nobody can work all day, all night. Even if you\u2019d like to, the hard work of gold miners is often hampered by the force of nature. Difficult weather conditions can easily spoil the machines and stop the extraction for a long time, not to mention the winter, when you can\u2019t dig at all.<br />\nGenre: Simulation Of Gold Mining<br />\nPlatform: Pc<br />\nRelease Date: Q3 2017Support Us On Kickstarterhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1752350052/gold-rush-0<br />\nhttp://goldrush-thegame.com<br />\nhttps://facebook.com/goldrushthegame<br />\nhttps://twitter.com/goldrushthegame<br />\nhttp://codehorizon.com<br />\nhttps://facebook.com/thecodehorizon<br />\nhttps://twitter.com/thecodehorizon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-19T18:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671da72d282b3169568748fc2fcec927.jpg", "website": "http://goldrush-thegame.com/", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 101, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 11, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 170, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Code Horizon"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay S.
