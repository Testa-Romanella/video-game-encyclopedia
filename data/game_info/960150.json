Great, now there's blood and corpses everywhere. Thankfully they're fake.. right?<br/><br/>He's only apparently got a few minutes to find the pieces and solve the puzzles if he does not wish to end up like all these dead bodies sprawled everywhere. Hilarious. If he finds whoever pulled this prank on him they're not going to laugh anymore!<br/><br/>Temple of Kasthet is a first person Puzzle / Escape game with an ambiance straight out of the horror movies from the 1930s, with added humour and sarcasm. You play as the (not) brave (at all) Brian Teaser, in a fantasy interpretation of a haunted egyptian pyramid. <br/><br/>Escape from the Temple and solve its mindblowing puzzles before they, well, blow your mind.<br/><br/><strong>In Temple of Kasthet, you will :</strong><br/><ul><li>Explore a terrifying environment in a first person view.<br/></li><li>Find and collect hidden puzzle pieces.<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles to unlock doors.<br/></li><li>Discover the story of the Temple with full english or french voice acting (subtitles available).</li></ul><br/>Temple of Kasthet was developped by Random Therapy, a 6 developer team (and a cat) from Switzerland. Lots of chocolate were consumed while working on this project.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T02:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cc/5cc70f125a2fd26b5120b1cce44281ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Random Therapy"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Random Therapy"], "esrb_rating": null}
