It was built in 72 hours for the internal Pulp Jam.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to\u00a0<strong>reuse, modify, share, etc</strong> any of our artwork, music, code, etc. for your Playdate games. Please credit us :)</p>\n<p>You control the robot AL1C3 in a quest to grow a plant by collecting water from different corners of the world. The game uses the crank and the accelerometer in some pretty weird ways, but it\u2019s all explained in-game (Crank+dpad to move, keeping the Playdate flat while transporting water).</p>\n<p><strong>Highly recommended to play on-device (if you have one)\u00a0for crank/accelerometer reasons</strong></p>\n<p>This game was built in 72 hours and goes far outside the scope of Pulp, which is built for simple interactive fiction. As a result of these things it uses very inelegant and inefficient solutions to do things that would otherwise be trivial in the regular Playdate SDK.
