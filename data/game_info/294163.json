{"id": 294163, "slug": "stellar-sphere", "name": "Stellar Sphere", "name_original": "Stellar Sphere", "description": "<strong>\"Stellar Sphere\"</strong> is a scifi sport and action game, mainly set in space and in <strong>zero gravity</strong>. The rules of this game are tremendously simple: you must move with your ship through an area, look for a sphere, capture it, and throw it over the wormhole that is active. That's all. Almost.<br/><br/>There's just one small detail, though: as you proceed with the scoring and the twenty-four levels, plus the infinite level, you'll have to deal with different hordes of enemies who will try to turn you to ashes. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, as you progress through the levels, the wormholes, and even the sphere, will tend to make it harder for you to score points. Not to mention the artillery that protects the wormholes, the asteroids, the ships that will steal your sphere, the disappearance of the wormholes, the walls, the changes in gravity, the gravitational traps, and other surprises that you will discover throughout the levels. You can even lose the scores if you're not careful. You can take care of all enemies with your weapons, EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) and guided missiles. You can also call a wingman when necessary.<br/><br/>The game has five initial areas, each of which presents its own challenges, based on its structure and unique elements. In addition, you'll be able to play through the game's four difficulty levels, and with the help of the pointer and active wormhole locator, that can be deactivated, making the game more difficult, but scoring more points.<br/><br/>Each of the 24 levels can be configured from 3 minutes to 15 minutes. More minutes means more points, but also more time you'll need to survive with the same weapons and resources. <br/><br/>Statistics will control how many levels you've won in every area, based on how you configured the time. Complete all areas with all the combination of minutes will be a challenge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Configurations and options.</strong><br/><br/>A complete set of configurations that can be combined makes the game as challenging as you could ask for.<br/><br/>The game incorporates an interactive tutorial the first time you play, that can be reactivated if necessary.<br/><br/>That's \"Stellar Sphere\". Scifi, sport, action, space, and combat. Fine-tune your reflexes. You'll need them.<br/><br/>A demo will be available with 10 initial levels and all the features of the game active.<br/><br/>If you want more info about the game, please read the manual and the site for more info to know all the details of the game. Easy to learn.
