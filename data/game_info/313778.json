In the Delta Genetycs Research Facility the scientists created a DNA that was believed to be the DNA of perfect humans, but they made a huge mistake... They have created the Matacinas. The chemical warfare left a deadly gas behind that killed most of humanity and Matacinas killed almost everyone who left. Survivors got sheltered in underground bunkers, except one survivor... Daniel Jackson. You are Daniel who is the only human survivor on the surface. You wake up in Stall Valley the only place with clean air. The governments of the old world hid the Machine somewhere in Stall Valley. The Machine is a system for cleaning the atmosphere of the Earth. If you clear all Matacina camps, and you'll have a chance to find the Machine, find its parts, assemble it and begin the endgame.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have a lot of knowledge about mechanics and different methods for crafting items. You can build huge buildings, shelters, find loot at a POI or a massive amount of loot in a nearby Matacina camp.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Please note that Afterlifes is still in an early alpha stage. This means that most of the planned features are not present yet and bugs might appear.
