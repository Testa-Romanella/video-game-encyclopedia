Why?  They don\u2019t know and they\u2019re not gonna ask. How? They\u2019ll figure it out,  or they\u2019ll have to admit failure and forfeit the right to wear their  fancy custom armor to work.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game features optional cooking  and crafting to supplement your items and equipment, two possible  endings, and in-game skippable tutorials for beginner RPG players.  Download files include a game guide with character bios, a map, links to  the resources used, and tips on finding some of the secrets.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There\u2019s secrets to discover and quips to make, all within about 1-2 hours of easy and irreverent playtime! <br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This was originally a test to practice my RPG Maker skills and to see if I could make a game in two weeks, because all my projects blow up and get so large I never finish them. It ended up going over two weeks but it's completed, so it's a win in that respect. This was posted on Tumblr in 2021, but I decided after having my Itch for a while to crosspost it. I'm thinking of doing some quality-of-life updates and/or an MZ port in the future so that should be fun.<br/></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have Mac or Linux machines to test on so I couldn't test those, although MV said they were successful but who knows at this point. I'm debating on whether to upload those versions or not.<br/></p><p>The enemies in the screenshots are from SeraphCircle. A complete list of resources and plugins used  is in the GameGuide in the download file.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab8c9eec28bfcdd7d0d349b86ded9c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eigwayne"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
