A <strong>Die and Retry</strong> I made last year. My first game in fact. The kind of game : \"Simple controls, hard to master\". If you enjoy that game style too, you may love it.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Goals :</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t&gt;&gt; Retrieve the money stolen by an organisation of evil bankers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t&gt;&gt; In addition to the nombre of coins collected, the game keeps track of your performance in <em>the art of jetpack heists</em>, using a combo system called <strong>strikes</strong> as a throwback to bowling. Coins or pins, the goal is to get'em'all after all...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe system is quite simple, each cart has a total of 5 coins, if you manage to snatch them all, you score a \"strike\" activating the combo system. Each consecutive strike adds to the multiplier to the values of the coin on the following cart.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t&gt;&gt; Collect all the badges.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls :</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tUp : [arrow up] or [space]\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTurbo kick : [arrow right] or [ctrl] ; Use it to break windows and kick enemies.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c599dc3fb3f4cd3dde3c445a4bd4b891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["romaincourtois"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
