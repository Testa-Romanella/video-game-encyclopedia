Also loosely inspired by Office\u00a0Space. :) It's super short, so enjoy!</p><p>Overall, I spent about 12 hours on the project and\u00a0I\u00a0created everything from scratch (models, rigs, animation, sounds, level) EXCEPT for the background music which I pulled from YouTube's free audio library.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter at\u00a0https://twitter.com/davidbyttow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T07:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92d67bec69abccb99771350cf5e71fc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David Byttow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
