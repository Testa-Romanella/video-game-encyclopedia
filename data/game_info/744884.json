I Re-did level 1 and added in levels 2 &amp; 3. Each level is unique.</p>\n<p>2. I created a Boss enemy who has the same design as the straight shooters and moves like the chasers, but is larger, has more help, shoots faster, and is worth more points.</p>\n<p>3. I added in two power-ups, one makes the player faster and the other causes the player to shoot faster.</p>\n<p>Created by Soren Gerlach</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0027ba9610da376cdac6b7dfb7f3e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gerlac32"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
