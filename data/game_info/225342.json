Detective", "description": "Kids Play Visual Games is an app that consists of 15 educational games developed to reinforce skills of visual and spatial perception, aimed at kids of all ages.<br/>Each of these games will help your child to process information and implement visual skills through fun eye exercises, accompanied by our raccoon pet and its animal friends, which will compliment and encourage kids every time they solve the game.<br/><br/>VISUAL ACUITY EDUCATIONAL GAMES <br/>This visual stimulation at an early age acts as a reinforcement to help their cognitive development and prevent possible attention and concentration problems. Babies and children will learn to:<br/><br/>- Identify shapes and colors.<br/>- Process spatial relation: orientation, size and position.<br/>- Associate silhouettes and elements.<br/>- Improve visual acuity searching objects.<br/>- Develop manual dexterity and motor skills.<br/>- Detect and classify intruders within a list of elements.<br/>- Differentiate figures and backgrounds.<br/>- Enhance their attention span and concentration.<br/>- Boost observation skills and difference perception.<br/><br/>Kids Play Visual Games are carefully designed with a simple interface in order to make children have fun while learning with animals and kid-friendly characters.<br/><br/>DIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVELS<br/>Our goal is that, whatever the intellectual capacity of the child may be, they can sharpen their visual acuity gradually.
