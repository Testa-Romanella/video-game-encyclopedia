Featuring fantastic tunes by Tenkitsune!<br/></p>\n<p>Meow Moves is a musical puzzle game in which you play a dancing cat witch. Combine cards to build up magical moves as you dance on stage, playing specific elements to match the audiences interests.</p>\n<p>Each level deals you a deck and a number of turns. Looking at the top of the screen from left to right shows what element you want to play. Looking at your hand of 5 cards, you play your hand. Putting two cards of the same color on top of one another adds them, putting two of different colors subtracts them.</p>\n<p>Lay your cards out on the far right cards to adjust their values. Clicking End Turn submits the right most card and moves your score up. Watch out though, playing the wrong card cuts your score in half!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d28473272ac4905fba0539777d527c9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["wolfybytes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
