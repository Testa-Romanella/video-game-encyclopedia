All you gotta do is stay at its side and power him with energy that you get from dead enemies. You can destroy incoming bullets with \"F\" or dash with \"Shift\". When the mech is overloaded with energy you can press \"Space\" when you are near it to gain control over the mech. While inside, you can advance to get score and kill enemies by clicking on them. <strong>Good luck!\r\n</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T07:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e1123376b2cd7e29f324bd087a4ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["bernadotornado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
