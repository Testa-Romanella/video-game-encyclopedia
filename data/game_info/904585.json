The stopwatch starts when Rod moves forward. There are some tight sequences and heroic leaps. Should Rod falter, he'll ride the Regeneration Transport to the room's entrance and feel like a whole new Rod. He can view his time and take it easy in the gift shop.</p>\n<p>Xbox controller uses D-pad and A. Keyboard uses Arrows, A, and D to move. Use Ctrl, Space, Up Arrow, or W to jump. Press Start or Esc to exit.<br/></p>\n<p>The theme song crossfades into different styles from level to level. The timbre is SID emulation through 32bit VSTs with chorusing.<br/></p>\n<p>The regeneration sound was made with the amazing\u00a0ChipTone.\u00a0Thank you, SFBGames.\u00a0https://sfbgames.itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you, SoundsDotZip, for the well designed and beautiful Cheerful-32 palette.\u00a0https://lospec.com/soundsdotzip<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you, Daniel Linssen, for the free use of the wonderful m6x11 font. https://managore.itch.io</p>\n<p>Thank you, Donitz, for the gear and blob.
