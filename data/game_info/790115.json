The game begins with simple addition problems, but as time goes on each problem gets more and more complicated, with division, square roots, and even integrals added to the mix as the game progresses.\u00a0To try again after getting a fatal error, just refresh the page.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for the UC Davis Game Development and Arts Club Game Jam, with the theme of \"layers,\" over about 2 days.\u00a0It was originally inspired by the idea of CRT television screens, as well as moving up the layers of math, although the scanline screen implemented ended up causing the text to be somewhat dark and tough to read at the harsh pace required. Nonetheless, it remains as an optional feature of the game that is activated whenever the player presses \"c\" on their keyboard.</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T08:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30ef414ae5d66df9edcf3c48b2f89f11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["jfo-ucdavis"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
