{"id": 136172, "slug": "build-it-up", "name": "Build It Up", "name_original": "Build It Up", "description": "<p>A Intense game like none other, Where items of all sorts jump from the ground and you have to catch them to build a tower, but here's the twist, gravity doesn't like towers so it's going to try to make the block's fall, you're going to have to figure out how to work around that and make an amazing tower and get the best score, If one block fall's off the edge of the platform GAMEOVER. Now if you want to bring it up a notch, try out Gamemode's where we change some of the rules of gameplay. We currently have 16 gamemodes for you to try out, such as Skinny, where the platform in skinner then normal, Shake, Where the camera is shaking, No Touch, Where you can't touch the platform, and my favorite, Fade, Where the camera keeps fading in and out. After you''ve master that, Take you skills to the EXTREME in Extrememode's where we take 3 gamemodes and put them into one, But we don't tell you what there going to be so your going to have to guess. We have a Crossover mode where we take textures from other game's and put them into our own. So the block turns into a Facebook logo. We currently have 4, Social Media, Indie Store's, DEP, and Geometry Dash. You can learn some new skills or figure out how to play in the practice mode where you can drop all the blocks you want and nothng will happend. So do you think you have what it takes to Build It Up?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09ece65fa8f0c4d533bdee0dd82b7ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blackdrillstudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
