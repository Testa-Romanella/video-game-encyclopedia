I\u00a0also wanted to avoid using a minimap so the player would have to build a mental map using generated \"landmarks\" (pickups and flora) instead of a map being given. Project time was\u00a0about 1-2 hours a day for 2 months.</p><p>Head into these mysterious caves to find the rare and valuable material known as Arengium. The Arengium makes the caves unstable, so watch for falling debris and other hazards as you search for valuables.</p>\n<p>The caves are randomly generated using either a seeded value you supply or a completely random level.</p>\n<p>WASD or the arrow keys to move around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f404fbb9d09173e505097b343b4b2a11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatthewTarbutton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
