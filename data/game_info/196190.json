I wanted to show how much I improved as an artist and a game dev by making a new game and releasing demos along the way. Unfortunately, I got overwhelmed with the development process and school became more important to me so I stopped working on it.</p><p>The enemies and art are much improved even though I made this in 2008. The sounds and music aren't by me but everything else is original to the best of my knowledge.</p><p>Try to enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f5ff83f0a7200fd31263dfbb5dc992a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Warrer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
