Your goal: Survive the work day while working as little as possible. <br/></p>\n<p>Whenever you are in the field of view of the boss, type as fast as you can (just mash random keys on your keyboard) to avoid getting fired. Whenever he looks away, stop typing and just slack. The longer you slack without interruption, the faster you earn points.</p>\n<p>Each game takes 5 minutes. The route of the boss is fixed, so it helps to memorize it.<br/></p>\n<p>My personal best is 1702 points. Can you beat me?</p>\n<p>If you have any constructive criticism, feel free to comment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b6c9606f30c3d8c577c5bbf23cad2e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhilippTheProgrammer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
