By getting lost, he also loses his powerful Vinyl Discs.</p>\n<p>The Vinyl Discs have a peculiarity, they stop time from Rewinding, which is a common thing to the Dj due to his short memory(no wonder why he got lost).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the arrows or the WASD keys to move around the maze.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Info</em></strong></p>\n<p>I know the game is kinda short, but this is my first game jam ever!
