If the Brix pile up too high and a new stack cannot be spawned then it\u2019s game over.<br/><br/>Maneuver the falling stack of three Brix and rotate their positions within the stack to set up matches.<br/><br/>Match three or more Brix vertically or horizontally to score points and reduce the Brix Left counter.  When the counter hits zero, you move to the next level.  Pass five levels to get to the next stage.  Each of the first nine stages of the game add new Brix and abilities.<br/><br/>Match four or more Brix in one move to earn charges for abilities you can use to make your job easier:<br/><br/><ul><li> Bomb: causes a large explosion that destroys the blocks in the middle of the play field<br/></li><li> Hourglass: temporarily slows time<br/></li><li> Randomizer: randomizes colors of the blocks on the play field</li></ul><br/>At higher stages, beware of the unmatchable carbon fiber Brix.  They will not form matches and will clutter up the play field.  However, a bomb can destroy them.<br/><br/>Choose from four difficulty levels to change the speed of the game and the size of the scores.  The top ten high scores are saved on the High Scores page.  Play at a higher difficulty level to get bigger scores.  Scores also get larger as you advance stages.<br/><br/>Once you reach a stage you may use the Stage Select feature to start at that stage without having to play through the lower stages.<br/><br/>For our color blind friends, or if you just want to play with a different style of Brix, turn on Color Blind Mode to add symbols to the Brix.<br/><br/>The game also features dozens of animated backgrounds, and electronic music.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:20:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d673df94400b31222d8e6fd66c6f2280.jpg", "website": "http://sol6studios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ed Salisbury", "Ray Yep Jr."], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sol 6 Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
