They don\u2019t know who they are, they don\u2019t know where they are, they know nothing of themselves and the world around them. So, they decided to leave the place, hoping they\u2019ll know themselves better and learn about the woods surrounding them. One by one, they meet and befriend other creatures. Of course, there are some creatures that are less \u2026 friendly, but it didn\u2019t stop them from their journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly yet surely, they began exploring the areas in the forest. From the areas with lots of passive creatures, until the areas with a lot of violent creatures. Even after all the hardships, the little creature still insists on exploring and knows the forest better.\r\n</p>\n<p>Until the journey drained their energy, slowly but surely, until they had nothing left. There, in the gray area where there\u2019s nothing, they fell into a long slumber.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Suddenly, trees began to sprout. Flowers began to bloom, grass began to fill the area of nothingness. The area full of gray began to fill with colors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Until the little creature began to slowly wake up again with nothing in their memories, forgetting all of their journey they went through. And so, they embark on another journey with the same goal in mind: to know the world and try to obtain information about them.\r\n</p>\n<p>Members:</p><p>Ahmad Alfian Tri Saputro = Programmer</p><p>Bianglala Aisha R = Visual Art</p><p>Shafa Raisa Hazet = Audio Art</p><p>Maisa = Writing</p><p>Delon = Programmer</p><p>Axel = Game Design</p><p>Kaori = Visual Art</p><p>Deanara = Audio Art</p><p>Miqdam = Game Design</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T10:50:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/9600dd6facaa65b171ddcbe57949cd54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["elonsquidion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
