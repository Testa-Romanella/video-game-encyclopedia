Make everyone lose their sanity until they join your naked rebellion and don't stop until everyone is on board.</p>\n<p>Made for Ufeffjam 2 in roughly 48 hours over a few weeks, using a pixel art pack from wareya, with sounds and music from Nightingalle.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>- WASD/arrows to move, space to pick things up and throw them. (Alternatively try a controller (tested with Xbox series controller on Windows)</p>\n<p>- Find villagers with lowish sanity, if they're running away, chase them down to convert them.</p>\n<p>- Throw things at villagers who try to resist until they panic<br/></p>\n<p>- It'll be easier to make villagers panic the more of your followers there are nearby.</p>\n<p>- Don't let your flow run out, watch out for the pants meter. It decreases over time and when you get punched, but recovers every time you get a new follower.</p>\n\n<p>Game runs on the libre FTE Quakeworld engine, game code for modding is included game/src directory, I'm licensing the .qc and .src files under MIT license. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39dfae353d8f6864b057249d054e08dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["shp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
