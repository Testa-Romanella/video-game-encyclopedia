You have to keep three stations running to gather minerals for research. Whenever the stations break down, you need to venture outside into the thick snowstorm to repair the stations manually. Make sure to steer clear of any threats on the way...</p>\r\nBeware: Prototype!\r\n<p>This game is currently a prototype and is thus completely unoptimized, unpolished and unbalanced. I cannot do much about the latter two, but in case the game isn't running well for you, there is a \"<strong>Potato Mode</strong>\" option in the Pause Menu.</p>\n<p>As for a tutorial, there is a literal wall of text in the game. Just turn right after starting the game. If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them in my Discord in the <em>#project-stracciatella</em> channel.</p>\n<p>Have fun playtesting and let me know what you think! :)</p>\r\nKeybinds\r\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Key</strong>Move AroundW, A, S, DSprintLeft ShiftRepairEPauseEscape or P", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T01:04:10", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thecreator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
