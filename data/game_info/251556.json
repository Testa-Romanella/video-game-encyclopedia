Assume the role of the fictitious, third world dictator, Kimmie Jong On.  While at the beach, he fell into a hole caused by an earthquake.

Help Kimmie, in this overhead style shooter, eliminate, one by one,  the nuclear powered countries of the world.  Help our antagonist, in the protagonist role, shoot his way through the Atlantean labyrinths, dungeon like entrapments filled with enemies, puzzles, sub-bosses, and bosses.

All this, eventually, leading to an epic showdown with Atlantis's ultimate weapon, the Artificial Sentient System, A.S.S.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27c072ebd472583ca497ada7fc3dea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delicious Diamond Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Delicious Diamond Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
