He made an Italy stereotype game and I put some England/UK related jokes and nuances a non english person would do together to form this. \r\nIn the first scene use A/D or the arrow keys to move around :)\r\nThe challenge\r\n<p>Everything in this game (the design, the art, the coding and the music) were over the course of 24 non consecutive hours.</p>\r\nThe game\r\n<p>scUffed arKade is basically a collection of three increasingly lower effort minigames.</p>\n<p><em>Shakexpired</em>\u00a0 is a small rhythm game. A random sonnet by William Shakespeare is selected and the player must type the characters that appear on screen before they hit the double decker bus. The cloudy sky and desaturated colors make for an artsy scenario.</p>\n<p><em>How many</em> is a memory game. The player has to count how many copies of each item appear each turn and then answer a question. The items are assets I had made for a previous concept that I\u00a0would have not been able to carry out in &lt;24hours.</p>\n<p><em>Flag-match</em> is the virtual embodiment of putting very little effort in something just because you want three and not only two minigames. Enjoy.</p>\r\nSoundtrack\r\n<p>Stream the soundtrack over at\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/whateep-punk-pebble/sets/shakexpired-ost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T07:28:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd9c72bf57145e605a9f2b59455f634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whateep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
