My requirements were to make a game with ladder and only use 4 colors, and everything else was a personal design decision.</p>\n<p>The level is made with procedurally generated 5x5 chunks that can be moved around like a swap-two puzzle game like Yoshi Cookie or Bejewled Blitz. If expanded upon, I would turn this into an asymmetrical co-op game where one player controls the puzzle board and the other controls player character.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f1c2f97c2d5aa2ded9b7b96cab60c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fancypanda98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
