The game is set in the same universe as Surgeon Simulator 2013 and serves as a prequel to it.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>A paranoid therapy patient starts noticing slices of bread or toast moving in his house. He takes it as a warning from an unknown party or as a taunt. The patient later finds out that the only reason behind the slices of bread being moved around is that the bread became sentient. A chain of incidents with the involvement of the bread leads to the Patient, mister Murton, having a heart attack and crashing his car. After the crash, he is taken to a hospital by the Surgeon that is the main character of Surgeon Simulation 2013.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players control a slice of bread with the objective of making toast. It is essential to keep an eye out on the edibility meter, as the players can encounter environmental hazards, such as fluids, before turning into a toast. Each level of the game represents a different day of the week.</p>\n<p>The game was thoroughly supported with multiple expansion packs. Several new types of bread were added, such as a baguette, a bagel, or a cracker. The type of bread chosen changes the objective the players have to complete. For example, while playing as a baguette, the players have to destroy all the fragile objects they find in the room.</p>\n<p>New levels were also added to the game. One of which is a crossover with Team Fortress 2 and its sandwich item.</p>", "metacritic": 60, "released": "2015-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-25T17:13:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e58c2d062472909ab910958185ad00f.jpeg", "website": "http://www.iambreadgame.com", "rating": 3.07, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 1424, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 144, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 194, "ratings_count": 192, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 194, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Android", "PC", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "iOS"], "developers": ["Bossa Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bossa Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
