When a cage appears, you need to destroy them quickly, before they fly away. Even after freeing a Buddy, you'll still have to catch them as they fall. After successfully saving one, you'll get a particular power-up!</p>\n\n<p>All you can do is move left/right and shoot above you. One hit from an enemy is all it takes to end the game, so be extra careful! Survive for as long as you can, and build up a high score!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1 (Theme - Stronger Together):</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5<br/></p>\n\n<p>All assets were made by me, DomedVortex!</p>\n<p>Some assets I used are from my own asset packs, that you can use in your own games!</p>\n<p>https://domedvortex.itch.io/domedvortex-rpg-icons-1</p>\n<p>https://domedvortex.itch.io/domedvortex-pixel-platformer-pack<br/></p>\n\n<p>Current Version: Game Jam</p>\n<p>- 4 Buddies</p>\n<p>- One endless level</p>\n<p>- Music is taken from my previous games</p>\n\n<p>Follow my Twitter for more game-related stuff!\u00a0https://twitter.com/DomedVortex<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f09b7d728eb7464fb2c62e68d785cdd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DomedVortex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
