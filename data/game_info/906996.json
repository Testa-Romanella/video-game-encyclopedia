You are sleek, powerful, and feared by all who encounter you. But now, you have a bumper attached to your body. It's a strange and cumbersome feeling, like having a giant weight dragging you down. You can still swim, but it's not as easy or graceful as it used to be. The bumper restricts your movement and makes you stand out in the water, drawing unwanted attention to yourself. You feel vulnerable and exposed, like you've lost some of your natural defenses. At the same time, you are aware that the bumper is there to protect you and the humans who share your aquatic home. It's a strange balance of power and vulnerability, and you are not sure how to feel about it.</p>\n<p>\"I may have a bumper attached to my body, but it can't stop me from being the fierce and powerful predator that I am. I may be slowed down, but I will never be held back.\"<br/><strong>- Great White Shark with a Bumper\u00a0\ud83e\udd88</strong></p>\n\n\n<strong>Player 1:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<strong>Player 2:</strong><strong>Forward</strong>: [W]\r\n<strong>\u00a0<br/>Turn</strong>:[A],\u00a0[D]<strong>Forward</strong>: [ \u2191 ]<br/><strong>Turn</strong>: [\u2190], [\u2192]", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T13:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d4b9f15ee4055f4d5db2ba7f0b4f2d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BimgusGaminf", "Rpyaanng", "coloredasterisk", "Mancavea"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
