And I know back in the day they didn't use Unreal Engine to make the games and that it is hardly a retro game engine, but I like UE and that's that.<br/></p>\n\n<p>btw, you NEED a NUMPAD to play the game. this is because I wanted to make the game as reminiscent of the og PC-88 games as possible and all their controls are built around the numpad.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T10:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/3581e188e0b06efee4c61afa113448b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BulletEyeGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
