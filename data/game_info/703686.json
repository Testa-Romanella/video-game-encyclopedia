So far, only her trusted assistant, Deborah, knows the truth. The hive has not enough royal jelly left, so it can\u2019t produce a new queen. Deborah cannot allow her sisters to know the truth, as this would cause the hive to collapse in chaos. She has a plan: she will guide the hive herself, as if she was the queen herself, and will lead the bees to make the needed royal jelly for her. The plan is simple: using B-pop to convince the other beehives in the New World Central Park to do their bidding. She will not only make the hive prosper again. She will be the Queen of the New World.<br/><br/>How to play:</p>\n\n<ul><li>use arrows keys do move the bee.
