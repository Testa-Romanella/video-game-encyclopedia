She is so abnormal that even the fantasy land of Gensokyo considers her an anomaly. Truth is, she can visit Gensokyo in her dreams!<br/><br/><h3>A new incident has occurred, and Gensokyo has a  clone problem</h3><br/><br/>Artificial Dream in Arcadia is a first person dungeon crawler where the player, as Sumireko, has to navigate tricky mazes and capture a party of the strongest Touhou characters to assist them in turn-based battles. Go all over Gensokyo and beyond, to solve an incident which seems a little too convenient for Sumireko, seeing as she's the only person in Gensokyo who has a tool to control this infestation of clones: her newly-bought smartphone.<h3>A large selection of your favorite Touhou characters</h3>Clones are roaming the lands! They are known as Sleepers and take the shape of established Touhou characters, and as such, almost every Touhou character is represented and playable. Sumireko's phone is equipped with a special app that allows her to capture Sleepers by beating them in a round of Danmaku. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you win, you can add them to your party, or turn them into useful items! You can also fuse multiple Sleepers together to make something new entirely.<br/>Adding Sleepers to your party will increase battery usage. If your phone runs out of battery charge, you will lose access to Sleepers and your Map, so always come prepared!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A set of desktop wallpapers is included with the game. You can find them in \\Touhou Artificial Dream in Arcadia\\wallpapers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T03:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19d3a8406cae5c486aa91092dca54403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 22, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bar Holographic Otaku", "potemki11"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u4e1c\u6e38\u9274", "Bar Holographic Otaku"], "esrb_rating": null}
