Subtitles can also be enabled in the main menu or pause menu.</p>\n<p>Play time: ~30-40 minutes</p>\n<p>\r\nThe downloadable versions provided below are better quality (and less likely to hit performance issues) than the in-browser version, but I like to make an in-browser version available since that's easier for some people. Plays in the browser on Chrome in particular are occasionally buggy in non-reproducible ways, and I simply can't debug these problems well. Also Godot audio in Chrome on Windows still has a tendency to be a little weird (although not as bad as before) - if you're on Windows, playing in Firefox or downloading it may be better overall.  Sorry. I tried.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>Toggle dialogue choices</em>: A/D or Left/Right arrow keys\r\n<br/><em>Move around</em>: A/D or Left/Right arrow keys\r\n<br/><em>Select</em>: E or Space\r\n<br/><em>Pause game</em>: Esc\r\n<br/><em>Menu navigation</em>: WASD or arrow keys</p>\r\nPlay in the browser\r\n<p>Click \"Run Game\" and wait for it to load. It may take some time. Note that it won't run properly on mobile browsers. If it seems laggy or slow, try restarting your browser and/or computer.</p>\r\nDownload on Windows\r\n<p>Download the Windows zip below. Windows will probably block execution of the game in which case you will need to convince Microsoft Defender to run the game via More Info &gt; Run Anyway. I don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars for code-signing certs, sorry.</p>\r\nDownload on Mac OS\r\n<p>Download the Mac zip below. MacOS will probably block execution of the .app file, which you can bypass in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General &gt; Open Anyway. I don't want to shell out a hundred dollars to get Apple notarization, sorry.</p>\r\nContent warnings\r\n<p>(Highlight below to view - may contain spoilers) </p>\n<p>\r\nEnclosed spaces, suicide, character death, loud or sudden noises, general horror elements; discussion of the following: mass suicide, cults </p>\r\nAudio attribution\r\n<p> \r\nspectral violin drone processed through granulation and reverb by offthesky under CC-BY 3.0 License\r\n</p>\n<p> \r\nMan Crying and Whimmering.flac by qubodup under CC-BY 3.0 License\r\n</p>\n<p> \r\nDark Cave Drone by Kinoton under CC0 License\r\n</p>\n<p> \r\nRockScrape04 by nickyg11p under CC0 License\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-15T04:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/0930d7359ead183d2c719e9af07b0597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ribyrnes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
