Scarf is an exciting adventure that blends the lyricism of a walking simulator with a 3D platform game to offer an allegorical journey through three beautiful worlds. The Meadow, the Desert, and the Mountain are places filled with mystery. Will you discover their secrets? And at what price?<br />\nImmerse yourself in a metaphorical tale without words, which reflects on what it means to be a hero. With your scarf as your only ally, your mission is to trap the rebellious souls that have created their own worlds.<br />\nExplore three beautiful 3D landscapes, each with its own unique mechanics. As you enter each world, your scarf will learn new abilities that will allow you to overcome the toughest challenges. Jump, glide or slide as you discover the secrets of the Plains, the Desert and the Mountain.<br />\nDiscover a rich mythology connected with the great issues of today: diversity, globalisation, ecology, freedom. Scarf tells its story purely through images; each player must reconstruct their version of the facts by exploring the three worlds.<br />\nEnjoy an audiovisual section that will transport you to a fantasy dimension filled with light and colour. And also shadows. Scarf should be played with serene composure, savouring the beauty of each landscape.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-17T10:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24398bde4aaa184c60711a76c9a17dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 46, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Uprising Studios", "Isaac James"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "HandyGames", "Isaac James"], "esrb_rating": null}
