During the night time cycle, you would be able to build in essence a construction that would aid you in processing food quicker with the help of machines and conveyorbelts. The game could potentially include a sandbox as well as a story mode (although neither exists in this prototype).</p>\n<p>The setting is supposed to be a restaurant in an elderly care facility where the restaurant is called Bettys, and therefore the name of the game is Five nights at Betty's. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Movement - WASD<br/>change between night and day - N<br/>In night mode change between objects being placed - F and\u00a0 R<br/>Rotate object - Q and R<br/>Left click mouse to place selected item<br/>Right click mouse to remove selected item<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd6db736507ae6a80e0a386b487dd34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cajoho99", "Noxemia", "rsrp", "SantaPoro"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
