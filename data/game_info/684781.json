There are 10 levels, and playtime likely won't exceed 10 minutes. Made for Xanderjam 5. Made by a team of 2. The theme \"time\" is applied by the gameplay mechanic of pausing time to platform on falling objects.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD and Arrows to move and jump. R to reset, and T to stop and start time.</p>\n<p>If browser build doesn't load, play the downloadable version!</p>\n<p>Necessary credits: I used SuperUnityBuild for this, it keeps the process of building to multiple platforms from taking hours during game jams. Made by Chase Petit and Robin North.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T10:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a593c1faee0e7ca1fd7f7897475e33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Xenoparrot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
