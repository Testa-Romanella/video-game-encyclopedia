Pick the coins and drop them to your coin area (the place in dotted lines). When the timer runs out, team with the most coins wins!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>You can play this game with 4 players by using joysticks.</p>\n<p>I suggest not playing with more than 2 player per team. It becomes pure chaos.</p>\n<p>Aand lastly this is my first time making music for games. It sounds a bit cheesy and doesn't really fit well\u00a0but hope you like it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3146396249633a19b62ed6d6b359123f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ytkimirti"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
