Steal the dice of your enemies to beat them at their own game!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Use <strong>left click</strong> to shoot and use the <strong>WASD</strong> keys to avoid enemies and survive. Enemies will drop dice - each die will have a certain effect every ten seconds.<br/></p>\n<p>Red Die (Demon Die) - boosts enemy hp by 5 times the face value<br/></p>\n<p>Orange Die - boosts player damage by the face value</p>\n<p>Green Die - boosts player firerate (rounds per minute) by the face value</p>\n<p>Blue Die - boosts weapon piercing by 0.1 times the face value</p>\n<p>Hold and release\u00a0<strong>right click</strong> to reroll all nearby dice. Beware of <strong>snake eyes -</strong> when there is a pair of matching color dice that are both 1, both will disappear. Use this mechanic to remove red dice from the map whenever possible, and prevent your dice from being rolled into 1s at all costs.<br/></p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>Skull (10 base HP, 5% die drop chance): normal enemy with no special properties. Will attempt to ram directly into the player.<br/></p>\n<p>Ghost (15 base HP, 20% die drop chance): moves to the nearest non-red die and tries to roll it to one, then continues with the next nearest non-red die. If there are no dice it needs to roll, it will attempt to ram directly into the player. Can float through other enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>Ghost Lord (50,000 base HP): boss enemy that fires bullets at the player. Spawns towards the end of the game; defeat it to win.<br/></p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>-\u00a0This\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0GMTK 2022 Jam\u00a0(theme: Roll the Dice)</p>\n<p>- Some of the art/sound was reused or modified from my old games to save time<br/></p>\n<p>- The game isn't meant to be very difficult, but it can be a little unfair with demon dice drops (red dice only have a 1 in 4 chance of dropping in place of a normal die, but you might get a bunch at the beginning if you're unlucky), so it's recommended that you play it a few times</p><p>- The web version is a little laggy because of the number of enemies on screen; if it gets unplayably laggy, I recommend downloading the desktop version<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to post your final stats below!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:44:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10ea16be0d800b28c0cfb7f11122a3af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Incognito_User"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
