You have to go\u00a0through the underground basement by shifting your packages around the rooms.</p>\r\nHow to play ?\r\n\n<p>You have to pass all 15 rooms to reach your destination. You will spawn at the left-side of the room. The blue thing is <strong>you </strong>and the green thing is your <strong>package </strong>that you have to deliver to the destination. You have to pass 15 rooms by shifting your package to inside the door that located at the right-side of the room. You can push your package or you can pull to yourself by pushing <strong>[E]</strong> when you are at the near of the package. When you grab the package, the color of package will turn into <strong>white </strong>and this means you can pull the package to yourself if you want. You will come across with some creatures in every room. They will try to reach and hit you. You can attack and kill them but you don't have to do that. You can just avoid all of them and shift your package to the next room.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>[\u2190\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2191\u00a0</strong><strong>\u2193]</strong>\u00a0<strong>Arrow keys</strong> and <strong>[E]</strong> key to grab the package and start the game.<br/></p>\r\nLast words...\r\n<p>First of all, thanks for the jam!
