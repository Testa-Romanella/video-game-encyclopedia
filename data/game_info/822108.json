Pip-Squeak\u00a0is a game about placing dice and then bouncing projectiles off of them in order to hit enemies. You start each turn by aiming and throwing three dice onto the board. You then can fire three bullets, which must bounce off the dice on the board before hitting enemies in order to deal damage. The value of each die that the bullet hits will be added to its damage, rewarding you for making tricky shots, and making high rolls very valuable. You must use these bullets to keep the enemies at bay, as after each turn all current enemies will move towards you. If three enemies manage to reach you, it's game over! You'll need to clear all waves of enemies, which have increasing amounts of health, in order to win. But beware of relying on chip damage! Higher-health enemies will split into several smaller enemies if they are damaged by less than their health, meaning your best bet will be do deal as much damage in a single shot as possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8997bbc423a34efdf5f2f61f828896.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["katebriggs", "Infohazard Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
