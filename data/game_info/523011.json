Every nation from the old era has their own planet, except America. In this galaxy, order is maintained with an iron fist by a galactic order. And you had better not advocate for the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNaturally, some men have decided against this and have rebelled against the new galactic order. You play as a captain in the newly formed American nation and the empire will be arriving soon to wipe everyone out and make an example out of you so that the other nations won't \"step out of line.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf a man is worthless, can he change?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDev note: This is my first video game ever made, and I decided to make a tower defense game because it was the simplest thing I could learn to code and get my \"feet wet\" with becoming a video game developer. I'm using a streaming tv series script that I've been writing and working on since 2008 (and continue to do so) as the base story for the entire Seditionis franchise.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI certainly hope you will get value out of this game as I continue to embark on what I hope will be a fun and meaningful video game career. I've been wanting this for a long time and I just can't wait for all the lights to turn \"green\". If you like this game, please review it and consider purchasing the music soundtrack DLC to help support my next game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere will be big plans for sure, but one step at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMac/Linux users note: I don't have a mac or linux machine but this game was built and compiled using Unity v2019.4.1f1. So any linux or mac machine from a few years ago with similar hardware capability as mentioned below should be able to run this game just fine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T02:39:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0e60538e350954bc135d445c33bb1c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dragonflare Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Dragonflare Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
