{"id": 635372, "slug": "robo-worms", "name": "Robo-Worms", "name_original": "Robo-Worms", "description": "After the discovery of planet RN-20, nations of Earth must decide who will inhabit this new land. Attempts to share the planet and create peace have failed, forcing those who want full control of the planet to turn to violence. Originally sent to RN-20 for excavation, our nation's robots can be used to collect supplies and take out the opposing bots, claiming victory and securing control of this new planet full of resources.<h3>BURROW THROUGH THE PLANET</h3>Play as one of these battle bots and collect resources to help you fight to be the last one standing in this chaotic, addictive, mini battle-royale. Robo-Worms features a unique combat arena in which the players create space to fight by digging tunnels and using items to excavate the land. With the players in control of the environment, no two games will be the same.<br/><br/><br/><h3>UNCOVER DESTRUCTIVE ITEMS</h3>Dig through the planet to discover many unique items including enhanced excavation tools and powerful weapons to mold the terrain in your favor and eliminate the competition. All items can be toggled before a match begins allowing the players to create their own custom challenge.<h3>PLAY ONLINE WITH FRIENDS</h3>Invite up to 9 friends or play online and join public lobbies. Alternatively, join our discord to connect with other players, meet the developers and get sneak peeks on future content.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T04:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a840b2c77b2085d847728a47caacf1.jpg", "website": "https://discord.com/invite/WYg233cFmA", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Odd Squad Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Odd Squad Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
