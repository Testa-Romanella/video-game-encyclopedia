We quickly separated the tainted books in the library but we need more help to catch all the Doodlers.<br/>Please protect the precious records from the Doodlers!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Welcome to the Magic Library!</strong><br/><br/>Our Magic Library is located in Differlands. It is the ultimate archive that holds all books, documents, records, prints of the entire multiverse.<br/>We store records of 'all there is\u2019, so there are librarians of many different beings here, all working together in sections most suited to their specialty.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Librarian?</strong><br/><br/>Just like librarians on Earth, the librarians here also work to protect and manage records as well as provide information. The difference is that our clientele includes not just humans, but also beings from multiple dimensions as well (Even so-called gods!).<br/>Oh, but let\u2019s not forget the most important task. Exterminating the Doodlers!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Doodlers?</strong><br/><br/>I guess you could call them bookworms. Of course, they are very different from the bookworms on Earth. Doodlers aren\u2019t insects. They\u2019re mischievous little fairies.<br/>They're about as big as a human child\u2019s hand and look like circular scribbles clumped together. They can clump and separate their scribbly bodies to cause chaos within the books\u2019 worlds. Cute, you say? Absolutely not!<br/>Doodlers hide inside the books in disguise. If you leave them in there, they\u2019ll sabotage the books!<br/> They also tend to disguise themselves and hide inside books, making it quite easy to miss them. If you don\u2019t get rid of them, not only will they turn the book\u2019s contents into an utter mess, but they\u2019ll also eventually consume everything, leaving nothing behind!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Troublemakers</strong><br/><br/>Some books may even hold Troublemakers, born because of the Doodlers. They\u2019ll show up in many forms to harass you. Maybe as a villain, or even an alien. You can never know how they\u2019ll appear before you.<br/>To find the Doodlers fast, you must use the items in your hand wisely.<br/>Use the items to remove the obstacles and find the Doodlers.<br/>A raygun will be very handy for getting rid of the rascal aliens, and a watergun to remove the paints.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Me?</strong><br/>Well, you\u2019re you! Today, you must become a \u2605Special Librarian\u2605 to help other librarians and the denizens of the books as well!<br/>-\tFind the difference between the two views in front of you, whether it be people, objects, or the landscape, and select them with the controller.<br/>-\tYou may have to pay close attention to your surroundings or compare a small map to the vast landscape.<br/>-\tBookworms called \u2018Doodlers\u2019 are hiding in some parts of the pictures. Find them all to restore the ruined magic books to their former state.<br/><br/>How can I get a higher score?<br/>-\tDon\u2019t make mistakes and be fast.<br/>-\tTo receive the best reward, make full use of your sharp eyes, patience, and a little bit of luck.<br/>-\tWhen you clear the stage, you\u2019ll get a score based on your skills.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-31T02:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/1451d1ccfc184a8239bcc73e58fa9d15.jpg", "website": "https://www.differlands.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["INHIVE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["INHIVE"], "esrb_rating": null}
