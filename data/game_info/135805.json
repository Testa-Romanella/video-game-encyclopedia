As you explore these worlds you create in your mind, you may begin to see that something else is going on here. Each time you restart the game, you may start to realize that these worlds may be more intertwined than you previously thought. </p><p>This game plays out differently than other text adventures. You have multiple choices of actions to choose from and it's those actions that move the story forward. It could be best described as a Choose Your Own Adventure book, but in digital format. </p><p>Controls: Keyboard (Except for when the text scrolls off the page, in which case you must scroll using the mouse.) </p><p>You must select a letter that will move the story forward. These are found within parentheses. Also, you must press enter after each choice as well as after you have viewed the text that results from that choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f7884ef8bf70b51fc0ad4eef60b80b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Insania404"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
