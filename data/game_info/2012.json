Growers produce seedlings, that take over asteroids for the growers to turn them into flower-infested island-like structures. The growers are controlled by an entity called the mothertree. The greys start attacking the mothertree&#39;s colonies with an alarming rate. The player has to repel the attacks and figure out why they happened in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game begins with the player having only one tree on one asteroid. The game revolves around a certain life cycle, where the trees create seedlings, which in turn create more trees on other asteroids. The trees in the game are procedurally generated, yet it does not affect the gameplay much.</p>\n<p>10 seedlings around the asteroid are needed to create more trees. The players can send seedlings to other asteroids or make them fight with other seedlings. Several types of trees are available for the players, with the main tree being the dyson one, which shoots the enemy seedlings, which is accompanied by a defense tree, which produces mines.</p>\n<p>Almost every aspect of the game is procedurally generated, starting with the trees themselves and ending with the sizes and shapes of asteroids.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64ec8e88e63e7d17628c44269cb5850.jpeg", "website": "http://eufloria-game.com/", "rating": 3.48, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 32, "owned": 923, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 33, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 60, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 60, "platforms": ["PC", "PS Vita", "Linux", "iOS", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Tuna", "Rudolf Kremers & Alex May", "Omni System", "Omni Systems"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Omni Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
