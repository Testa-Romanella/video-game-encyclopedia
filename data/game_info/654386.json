Pluto isn't big enough to knock the other bodies out of orbit thus failing\u00a0 criteria number three.<br/><br/>You'll play as Pluto as he attacks Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) to clear the neighborhood and\u00a0eventually take down the boss Eris. Will Pluto finally become a planet again? Probably not...but play to kinda find out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Kuiper Belt is a little too crowded and there's only enough space for one intergalactic mass body in these parts.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move: <em>WASD/Left Joystick</em><br/>Camera: <em>Mouse/Right Joystick<br/></em>Attack: <em>LMB/X/Square<br/></em>Shoot: <em>RMB/Q/B/Circle/RT</em></p>\n<p>source:\u00a0https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/why-is-pluto-no-longer-a-planet/<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Kuiper Belt Info:\u00a0https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b8d2e501eac330b9cb95a9884248003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harrison"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
