This game targets that by giving the player an automatic rifle which they can use to kill nearby wandering non-player characters (NPCs). Large billboards, TV screens and mobile electronic devices will then show up with a realtime view of another perspective such as security cameras.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07afc8ce7b32806b86719bc97def6f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Lynn", "Insaniac", "SirRed", "Liam_watson2003"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
