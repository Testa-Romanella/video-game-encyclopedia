Charlie\u2019s Last Song is an action-adventure, 2D relaxing platformer. The beautiful earth was hit by a meteor and a young dinosaur dragon creature by the name of Charlie must search through various landscapes and terrains to find her mother again and make sure she is alive. The game itself is described by the developer as a \"love letter\" to his mother and how \u2018we will always find each other, even in the apocalypse\u2019. It was originally released in Fall 2021 on Unity's webGL platform but has been reuploaded as a prototype to Itch. The dream is to turn it into a fully fleshed out highly polished game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Twitter: fliesandcxbwebs</p>\n<p>Instagram: fliesxandxcobwebs</p>\n<p>Twitch: fliesandcobwebs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:34:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abfad55031e20ae6d1a8a1dca2b538f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ty Nix"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
