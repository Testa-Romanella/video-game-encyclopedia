Ultramix 3 also features never-before-seen offline modes that cater to the casual, beginner and advanced dancers. &#39;Freestyle Mode&#39; lets newcomers to the series dance to any song without having to follow specific dance steps on the screen. Although players are not beholden to any choreographed moves, the game recognizes their dance patterns and will reward players for completing different step combinations. More seasoned players can enjoy the &#39;Quest Mode&#39; where they can travel from city to city and build the ultimate dance team by completing challenging songs and routines. The game&#39;s &#39;Jukebox Mode&#39; allows players to enjoy more than 65 upbeat tracks from the game and use them as background music. By serving up the hottest dance tunes, comprised of remixes, dance anthems and popular hits, DDR keeps everyone moving and grooving. DDR also returns with the classic &#39;Workout Mode,&#39; which gives gamers a method to track the progress of their dance/exercise routines and see how many calories they have burned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-01T07:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2f5/2f541d4f82f09c56800d4de6816c3697.jpg", "website": "http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.com/production/ddr_ultramix3/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 26, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox"], "developers": ["Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
