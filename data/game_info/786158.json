The pieces are colorful and engaging, with each shape representing something different than what it looks like - for example one square might be in blue while another has green writing on it! The goal of this puzzle isn't just about putting together the picture; rather kids must find all nine animals hidden among five sets around four levels by asking themselves questions such as \"Have I seen any birds?\",</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b6589d867d320c0696735db20f5de84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NapTech Games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
