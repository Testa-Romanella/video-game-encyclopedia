I\u00a0set the limitation to be whatever I\u00a0could do in roughly 8 hours. I set the limitation to arcade-style (movement + 1 button, high score) and found the theme of \"inseparable\" to use.</p>\n\n<p>From that came Star Catchers. Two star-crossed aliens trying to collect as many stars as possible while avoiding comets. They can't move too quickly, but they can use each other to cast a wider collection area, but that's also a wider area for comets to hit! Compete (locally ;) ) for the best high score!</p>\n\n<p>controls:</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow Keys - movement</p>\n<p>Space / Left click - Hold to expand, release to contract</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All done by me</p>\n<p>Game Engine: Godot</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Bfxr</p>\n<p>Music: Bosca Ceoil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abbef60cfa24b61c03bd8d1f998409cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["static_v0id"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
