I'm using this page to post and document my prototype builds.</p><p>It started out when I was working on a grappling hook mechanic for the sake of it. I kept expanding on it until I got to where I am now. My plans for Project Tundra is for it to be a <em>metroidvania</em>, with a heavy emphasis on exploration. My priorities during development have been <em>feel </em>and functionality. </p><p>Only recently I have started delving into art. A lot of it is still placeholder. </p><p>My goal for these prototypes are to serve as a <em>vertical slice </em>of gameplay so you can get a feel for what to expect from the final game. And as source of feedback from you, the player, so I can continue to improve it.</p>Contact<p>If you have any questions, critiques, suggestions, bug reports, or any other sort of feedback, I'm happy to hear it! <br/>email me at crabowitz@gmail.com<br/>If you'd like to keep up with development, follow my tumblr and to a lesser extent, my twitter</p>Changelog for 3.0<ul><li>I don't really have a purpose for this build to show anything off in particular, I've either improved a lot of existing systems since 2.0, implemented systems that aren't being used to their full potential yet, or otherwise made a bunch of small changes.
