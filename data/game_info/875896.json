Making a video game has been a dream of mine for a long time, and I decided this was the year I would give it some honest effort. I started a project called \"Videogame Sketches\" where I wanted to sketch out a video game concept once a month! Hah!<br/><br/>With work, life, not knowing anything,\u00a0and all the in between.. it took me a lot longer than a month! I was still determined to finish this before my next birthday, and here we are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a pure concept and is a playground\u00a0for me to explore and learn how to make a video game. All of my painful progress I released (still releasing) as Devlogs on my youtube channel. Here's an example:<br/></p>\n\n<p>So, now what?<br/>.. enjoy!<br/><br/>I would love feedback and thoughts. I'm not certain if I'll continue finessing this concept into a full game, or if I'll move on to another sketch. I think that depends on us! Let me know what you think!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for humoring me as I chase a life long dream that I hope is just the beginning . Now, hurry! Ghusty can't do this alone! Have a great time poofing out some candles!<br/><br/>MAC version coming soon!<br/><br/>-PuppyJoe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b0f0ef7bf712d26c1f8d0a04113243.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PuppyJoe"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
