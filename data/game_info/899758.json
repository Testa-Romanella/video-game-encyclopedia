I had other ideas for the game and could have added more levels as well, but I'm going to move forward with the course at this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am very open to any feedback you could give me about how I did!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T16:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e09b0d22ba8087d965ab9e5c11966f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Voodles"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
