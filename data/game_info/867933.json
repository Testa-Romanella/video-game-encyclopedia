{"id": 867933, "slug": "blobland", "name": "Blobland", "name_original": "Blobland", "description": "<p><strong>Blobland</strong> is a short,\u00a0<em>open world</em> platformer adventure game.</p>\n<p>It was obviously based on Unity's platformer mini game template, and it was made as a <strong>practice exercise</strong>.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Quests</strong> with <strong>rewards</strong></li><li>An <strong>open world</strong> to explore, with <strong>secrets </strong>and easter eggs</li><li>An <strong>upgrade shop</strong> to boost your character spending your quest rewards</li><li>A final <strong>bossfight </strong>in a lava zone</li><li>Nice little parallax effect</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is the final product. It was kind of a pain to work around\u00a0the original developer's code with things like the controls, collisions, and other interactions, as well as for some reason changing all the UIs I made and changing the resolution of the game automatically.</p>\n<p>If you experience problems with the controls, please bear in mind I didn't code them. The way they developped this was that for some reason if you stop pressing space you stop the jump mid-air.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally\u00a0you are entirely and completely unable to jump or increase your Y-coordinate if you're even close to a vertical wall. This got in the way of multiple upgrades and powers I wanted to implement.</p><p>Due to how collisions are handled, moving platforms are out of the quesiton.</p>\n<p>The game is finished. I'd much rather recreate the entire thing and then add upon it, without having to deal with all those problems, than updating this. This is why this game is marked as a release and not just a prototype or in development. It is finished, finally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b88c791528990cc15d7325ffbcf65285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NorielSylvire"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
