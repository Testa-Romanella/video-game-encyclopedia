Features: <br/>\r\n&gt; The user always has full control over the point of view (from the fetus' side), without having to use any external controllers. <br/>\r\n&gt; A responsive VR movie that reacts to user movements and actions seamlesly and that lasts approx. 7-10 mins. <br/>\r\n&gt; Plot told via dialogues that take place outside the body, with all audio being directional. <br/>\r\n&gt; Director\u2019s commentary available in-app as an on-demand feature (it appears at the end of the first run of the film). <br/>\r\n&gt; Selected for 7 major festivals. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDirector's statement: Birth and pregnancy are events full of magic, but also drama. Although all of us go through that part of life, no one is able to remember how it really was to be inside our mother\u2019s womb. To which extent can fetuses experience what\u2019s going on outside the womb? We wanted to explore the contrast between the calmness inherent in the womb and the complex reality that awaits outside.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a40999bbdc58f76fec62b9c7cbdf534.jpg", "website": "https://froont.com/the37thweek/edqjcn", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ricard Gras", "Michael Acosta"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Acosta"], "esrb_rating": null}
