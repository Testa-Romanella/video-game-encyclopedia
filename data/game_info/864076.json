If you hit a hazard or make a mistake, that's okay! The game will pause and you can rewind as far back as you'd like, just like a VHS tape!</p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows to move</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>P to pause the game\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left arrow to rewind, Right arrow to fast forward when the game is paused.</p>\n<p>Yellow blocks are pushable, blocks of static are hazards.
