You happen to be a student there in your final year of Highschool, and trying to graduate with the cleanest slate you can ever manage. Well, too bad that\u2019s thrown out of the window after meeting the Student Council. Hello, to your future in juvenile detention!</p>\n<p>How fun.</p>\n<p>Somehow, you\u2019re now dragged into this weird mess straight out of a fantasy novel. Magic? Monsters? Spirits? Fae? Demons? The Council has to be joking. No way are those things real, right? Because if not, then why on earth are seeing flowers bloom when the Vice President is around? A cool breeze passing by whenever the Secretary waves at you? Windows shimmering whenever the Treasurer walks by them? Dogs following and randomly appearing wherever and whenever the President is?</p>\n<p>This all has to be a coincidence, right?</p>\n<p>With noises coming from empty classrooms and staff members found somewhere they shouldn't, how can you not be suspicious about everything?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b605300515c750fa5de7460baf9a250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["I'm L"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
