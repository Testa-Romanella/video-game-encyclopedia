But remember, you are not alone in <strong>The Backrooms!</strong><br/><h3>Enemies</h3>There is Skinstealers, Partygoers and Smilers wandering the levels(and some surprise entities).<h3>Bacteria</h3>This tall black creature is lurking around level 0, if you hear heavy footsteps, just run as fast as you can.<h3>Skinstealers</h3>Entities that use other peoples skins as camuflages and mimic them to lure you into their trap.<h3>Partygoers</h3>These entities are too smart, fast and dangerous. But they are tiring too fast, you cant outrun them if they are too close, but if they cant catch you for a few seconds, they will just give up.<h3>Smiler</h3>These guys are smiling, and chasing you. Yeah, too scary.<h3>Multiplayer</h3>Cooperate with your friends, explore the levels and use your whistle to find your friends if they lost, but be carefull, <strong>entities hear that too!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T07:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a593ba9ef96054e4e9d9266226ae74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Efe Mert"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Efe Mert"], "esrb_rating": null}
