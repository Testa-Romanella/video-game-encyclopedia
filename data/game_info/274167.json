In fact you can't, but when you do feed, it'll either lose health or mood.</p>\n\n<p>Note: There's a problem with the embedded version that sometimes collision around the mouth isn't detected and you can't feed anything to the scribbler at all despite not having a full stomach. If that happens, please either refresh the page or download and play a desktop version instead. Sorry!</p>\n<p>FIXED: Noted bug: Game will freeze after playing it for a while. I will fix it as soon as I can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be6bfdea69cf63601b733e929bfcb251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["One Seed Fruit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
