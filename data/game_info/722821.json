You have 3 lives and when ghosts touch you they took one of your lives. You need to be alone for surviving. Also you have a gun and you can shoot the ghosts. There is a little twist though, your gun shoots bullets that can bounce from walls.</p>\n<p>With every new level you also get one more bounce. In level 1 your bullet bounces once, in level two it bounces twice... you get the idea</p>\n<p>Just don't get busted by ghosts\u00a0for one minute and a portal opens to take you in next level. Easy, right... Right?</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD for moving your character</p>\n<p>Mouse for looking around</p>\n<p>Left mouse button or space for shooting</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't complete it on 3 hours so I had to overtime, this game is NOT made in 3 hours.
