You're the boss in a dungeon and you must defeat the good guys coming to rescue a princess. The gameplay is only partially functional, you can pick up and roll dice, pick up and place them in the attack or block zone and select an enemy to attack... But then it stops working... Hope you like the idea and I'll fix the game after voting is over :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8bdc15359bd7e6a5c3189663dc18104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheBanterBroadcast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
