But it turns out Medella doesn't run a totally clean business. She tells you your job is to stand in the basement\u00a0under the mesh of her dice tray and poke at her dice to get the result you want while she covers them and distracts the guest. Ms. Medella's primary goal is to give people a chance to distract themselves from their day-to-day worries, so there's no need to exploit everyone who passes through, but it's like she says:\u00a0fair odds don't feed growling stomachs.</p>\n<p><strong>In the end, it's up to you to decide how fate plays out.</strong></p>\n<p>Portrait images come from\u00a0https://jayjay99.itch.io/1-bit-portraits.
