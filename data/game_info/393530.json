It's an FPS where there is bhopping, surfing, trimping, and also sex.<br/><br/>Grow your farm by hunting, making Kobolds, doing services, and selling product. Improve your house, buy lewd equipment, and interact with the town denizens.<br/><br/>Purchasing KoboldKare now will provide you with the following features:<br/><ul><li>A Quake/CS:S movement inspired movement system. Bunnyhop and trimp off of rocks for maximum height, speed-forage the forest with record time.<br/></li><li>A basic chemical system that lets you mix basic chems and feed them to Kobolds.<br/></li><li>You can grow only one type of Kobold, but they're capable of being either sex.<br/></li><li>There's a forest that spawns melons each night, grab them each night before dawn for optimal play!<br/></li><li>You can sell both Kobolds, and produce for cash!<br/></li><li>Currently there is no sexual interaction, but there will be soon...<br/></li><li>You can visit a single gas-station in \"town\" which is where you can buy supplies for your farm.
