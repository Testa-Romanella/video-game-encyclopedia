This game is still in development, but at a fairly late stage.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li>The runner at the bottom of the screen is constantly running forward. You have to prevent him from falling down by dragging platforms in front of him.</li><li>There are regular platforms, some are locked and immovable\u00a0(red border)</li><li>Some will shift the runner to the left or right (arrows)</li><li>Portal platforms teleport the runner to another portal</li><li>Wind (white arrows/triangles) will push you to the side. Be cautious there!</li></ul>\n<p>Try to get the highest score and comment it bellow!<br/><br/></p>\r\n\u2b07\ufe0fFeedback here!\u2b07\ufe0f\r\n<p>If you want to be extra helpful (or want to get a free background for the main game when it is released), you can fill out this form:</p>\r\n\u2192\u00a0https://forms.gle/39Lpc7JJS7LY2XZa8\u00a0\u2190\r\n<p>This way it's a lot easier for us to evaluate.\u00a0Thank you very much!<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\r\nSome bonus gameplay tips\r\n<ul><li>Stars and portals grant bonus score points</li><li>The wider you jump forward with a portal, the more score points you get</li><li>You don't need a platform beneath the wind, it will carry the runner regardless</li><li>Wind will always have priority if there's another type of platform beneath it</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T12:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be916f6c6b54a1fc8b1e264daff5de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Foxomat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
