{"id": 584352, "slug": "red-rust-free-demo", "name": "Red Rust / Free Demo", "name_original": "Red Rust / Free Demo", "description": "<p>Folks, it is our first ever demo of the game we've been working on for over 18 months.\u00a0 We are a small studio from Europe.\u00a0It's a small segment, just a single boss battle. But even this battle took load of sweat :) and we really need your feedback. We've been making this game for so long, and now \u00a0we crave attraction! We want the game to be played and enjoyed!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to get in touch with our team anytime:</p>\n<p>https://www.redrustgame.com/contact<br/></p>\n<p>If you have played the demo, please, submit us your feedback here:</p>\n<p>https://www.redrustgame.com/demo-feedback<br/></p>\n<p>P.S.</p>\n<p>You might and probably will encounter glitches here and there. We've been testing it out\u00a0for several days, but 'we' meaning just two people: the designer and the programmer. We probably missed a few spots. :)</p>\n<p>***\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Rust is retro-style sidescrolling game which uniquely combines fighting mechanics\u00a0 with shooting mechanics. The game is heavily inspired by 8bit and 16bit hits of the 90s, but it\u2019s being developed with the modern player in mind. We put emphasis on story and visual presentation.</p>\n<p>It's the year 1984 and you control Agent Red (or just Red), a soviet KGB officer who has been sent to the West on a secret mission. She is an attractive but brutal and cold hearted girl! Over the course of the game she learns to understand her own emotions and the unfamiliar\u00a0world around her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red Rust is only several hours long, but it is packed with boss battles, huge mechanical beasts, crazy plot twists and lots of fighting.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42606ccc75254f2e94bb59f44fc8512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtSource Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
