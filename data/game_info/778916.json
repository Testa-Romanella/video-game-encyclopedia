The framerate was only around 25 in VR, and about 35 in AR.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prototype is just that. Cringey dialogue that will be rewritten. Animations that need to be finetuned. And some facial animations that are really messed up on Scarlett. Still, I\u00a0would love for some people to try it out, and give me some feedback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:47:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad0d35522ecba39084fefbf489e5ae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoguePimptastic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
