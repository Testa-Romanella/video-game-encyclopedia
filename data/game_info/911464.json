{"id": 911464, "slug": "adventures-pixel-world", "name": "Adventure's Pixel World", "name_original": "Adventure's Pixel World", "description": "Adventure's Pixel World is a retro pixel style platform game. An homage to the era of classic challenging arcade games, with levels that keep getting harder, with more traps, more enemies and of course, giant big bosses to defeat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can follow more than one path to complete the harder levels, or if you are able, go through all the paths. You'll also be able to use flying ships to cross greater distances and reach higher places in the level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCollect as many candies as possible - that's right, candies... why candies? Why not?! - to buy stronger characters and have more chance to reach the end. There are also hidden treasures (achievements) in some levels... But that almost nobody will be able to find!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAttention: This is a simple but challenging adventure. There will be few who will reach the end. And if you are one of those legends and you triumph, don't worry, because more adventures will be added with new scenarios and new enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nComplete the levels by finding the holy relic at the end, while picking up as many candies as you can, facing enemy monsters and traps along the way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T03:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a6173fa5ecdb48a9cd7ffee4a9d311a.jpg", "website": "https://www.adventurerworldmobile.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fearless Colossus"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fearless Colossus"], "esrb_rating": null}
