Perry has stormed into Edo Bay, causing panic and threatening the possibility of violence. Over two hundred years have passed since Japan\u2019s borders were closed, limiting trade to Chinese and Dutch merchants. Now an American fleet is at the country\u2019s shores demanding trade and concessions.</p>\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<ul><li>Left mouse button to choose dialogue choices and advance text</li><li>\"S\" to open save menu</li><li>\"L\" to open load menu</li><li>\"Tab\" to open options</li><li>\"right arrow key\" (\u2794) to advance text quickly</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FULL-SCREEN IS ENABLED BY DEFAULT. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE FULL SCREEN! There's a bug that completely screws the dimensions and UI if you leave full-screen, so don't do that\u2014unless you want to. We need to fix this, which is why we're not including the key-bind for it. If you find it, wield the power cautiously.</strong></p>\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL YOU LEARN?\r\n\n<p><strong>You play as Tsumaki Naoharu: an ambitious and curious young samurai working under Abe Masahiro, the chief senior councillor of Tokugawa Japan. </strong>From his lofty position, Abe must steer Japan\u2019s response to this newfound threat. There are no playbooks to guide him, and your help will be crucial.</p>\n<p>You will discover that residents of Edo are on edge, the opinions of the local lords are at odds with each other, and the current systems are on the brink of being upended. You will learn that <strong>no one can decide whether to open up to Western trade or keep Japan closed entirely\u2014Abe is no exception.</strong> You will contend with multiple factions each with their own plans for Japan.</p>\n<p>Naoharu is the second son of his own family. Unlike his older brother, Naoharu does not have the right to inherit the family estate and is already in debt. He must perform well in order to keep his position in the Tokugawa hierarchy and establish productive political connections for a secure, debt-free future.</p>\n<p>As Naoharu, you will meet several factions whose ideologies and plans may intrigue, fascinate or puzzle him. <strong>It\u2019s up to you, the player, to decide which ideas hold the most weight, which ideas Naoharu will follow, and what end he will meet. Beware, however, of the consequences. The choices you make matter.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>There is no traditional sense of \u201cwinning\u201d in <em>Ghosts Over The Water</em>; the primary goal of the game is to explore and navigate the nuances of Tokugawa Japan's response to the Americans. You will discover what Japan feared, what it dreamed of, and what destiny it pursued in the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>In <em>Ghosts Over the Water, </em>the fate of Japan lies with you. </strong><br/></p>\r\n\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n<ul><li><strong>Email us at studio.unagi.1854@gmail.com<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Leave a comment below in our comments section</strong></li><li><strong>Fill out our bug report form!</strong><strong> </strong></li></ul>\n<p>We appreciate the feedback!
