The yellow spheres are boosters, but also serve as checkpoints: when you fail, you respawn at the last checkpoint, not all the way back at the beginning I learned from the last game jam not to make the game too hard, so that's my solution!</p>\n<p>Oh, also, be sure to click on the game as soon as it first launches. Otherwise, you'll miss out on the music at the beginning!</p>\n<p>I'm 15 years old and I absolutely love coding. My younger brother helped plan this game out, build the level, and even created the main music loop in GarageBand!\u00a0</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for?!? Go help the penny escape his lonely prison! Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/43002a4fb45248630b3a09370e2f18f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bennettapps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
