This social norm reveals a connection between those cognitive activities, and an element of order. Interactivity creates an environment comprised not only of comfort, but also control. The sense of order shields us from an unforeseeable and looming turmoil the outside world inevitably brings.<br/></p>\n<p>\tSalubrium examines the many forms this shield embodies, and the consciousness that surrounds it. I use cognitive activities as the common denominators of our personal environment. Altering them is a way of questioning the attitudes, fears and unwritten rules which have formed that environment and our behavior within it.</p><p>Note to user: Game may not open on first try. Please try opening game several times.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bc6478c7a63f45b79802763c48fe46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Adrion T.
