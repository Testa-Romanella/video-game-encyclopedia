In this way, equilibrium is not obvious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:07:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff62bd90b94852ad34442c490cf5589e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theorycraft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
