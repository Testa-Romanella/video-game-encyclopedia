Locked in a room with no windows, no doors and a bunch of dummies that just gained sentience... What could go wrong? Fight against the faceless enemies with whatever weapons you can get your hands on!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThree different ways to Rage: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFree Mode: Demolish hapless dummies with any weapons you can. Choose from the basic weapons to start and gain enough credits by destroying dummies to unlock bigger and messier tools of destruction. This sandbox mode is all about playing around and doing whatever you want. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStory Mode: Begin at \u2018Facility 12\u2019, a testing facility for different weapons as well as the most effective ways to deliver pain. You begin with basic weapons such as bats and clubs, then move your way towards more devious weapons such as crossbows and bubble guns. Be warned some of the dummies have been exhibiting sentience and aren\u2019t too keen about being destroyed for the sake of science. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrenzy Mode: Choose between frenzies that showcase various weapons types in Rage Room. If you ever wanted to be a Ninja *of course you do* well here\u2019s your chance! With 7 different frenzies to choose from, race against the clock to destroy the dummies. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also customize your dummies with 32 different accessories. Dress the dummies up with goatees, cowboy hats, afros or dunce caps. Even a dummy should look like a dummy, or the co-worker that microwaves fish. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to Rage Room an experience designed for VR.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f17104b75bd6dee111a12ea7c584d76.jpg", "website": "http://lockemreality.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Lockem Reality"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Lockem Reality"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
