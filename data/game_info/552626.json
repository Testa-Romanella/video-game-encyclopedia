And is deadly scared of bees...</p>\n<p>Highlights:</p>\n<p>* I am 41 and a father of three, a successful Executive in IT industry and this is the first ever completed game I actually started and finished. Thank you @Blackthornprod!</p>\n<p>* Original soundtrack - my second (first) hobby is music so I went on and composed a little rock'n'roll theme and recorded some audio effects together with my 6 yo son (you can hear different \"voices\" if you listen carefully)))</p>\n<p>*\u00a0addicting gameplay - those 30-90 seconds you play will be full of action and running from a chase of ever-growing bee army!</p>\n<p>*\u00a0in full transparency:\u00a0I used art I googled as a basis for almost all visual assets. Tweaked and changed for the purpose though.\u00a0But I still treat the whole exercise as accomplishment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Game was made for Blackthornprod Game Jam 2021 which had a theme \"Less is more\". In the game - the more honey you collect the less freedom you actually have.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game. I am\u00a0looking forward for your feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Andrey \"Createev\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/164f0079f30c0350ec5edfaafa870c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Createev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
