This car can help you to fly to a \"better place\".</p>\n\n\n<p>Your car needs fuel made by trash you\u00b4ll find scattered all over the map to be able to continue driving. Inside your car, you will get oxygen for you to breathe. If the car has no fuel it can\u00b4t make oxygen and you will die.</p>\n\n<p>To be able to get $ you have to store some trash in the car and sell.<br/>The goal is to raise 750$ and automatically buy a plane ticket for \"A better place\"</p>\n<p>In short, you will have to balance putting the trash into the fuel tank to get fuel and oxygen and selling the trash to get $ without dying... Good luck.
