As well as this I created a shooting mechanic; It features its own animations, projectile spawning, audio and particle systems.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try something a bit different here and do a mix of mechanics blueprints as well as having a go at animation blueprints too, putting them together into one project. The aim was to create a movement system that takes inspiration from the GTA games as well as the shooting being a mix between GTA and Gears Of War.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e8a6e9206dd96a4eb8e6cc12fc95f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Davies"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
