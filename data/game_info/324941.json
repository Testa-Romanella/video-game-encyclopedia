Your mission is to build a thriving mining community, and make tons of sweet moolah.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Are you up to the challenge?</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I had an idea for a simple mining colony simulator, so here it is. Don't take it too seriously. It's meant to be a fun little time waster, not a deep economic simulator.\u00a0I will be continuing to work on this as I find the time. The basic mechanics are complete, but all the graphics are placeholders. So, I'm going to work on polishing the gameplay, and updating the graphics. Also, sounds are coming!</p>\n<p>You may see a monster from time to time. His behavior is not properly implemented, so he will be changed in future versions.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Right click to open the building menu.</p>\n<p>Middle button selects the rock smashing tool.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to\u00a0let me know if you find any bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/16813b21851551a32a8109e2e719564a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maxwell Mudd"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
