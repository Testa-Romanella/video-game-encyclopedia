Your legs broke. After 3 months of intensive surgery, you can now walk (slowly), and jump (a little). Randomly, you find a gun, and it fuses to your arm. Oh no! Or maybe, oh yes? You can use its knockback and explosive blast to move around! But it is joined to your arm. So if it runs out of ammo, your arm fails, and you have to go back to hospital. That\u2019s a bummer. So maybe don\u2019t run out of ammo.
