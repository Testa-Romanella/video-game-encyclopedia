It's all about the choices that you will make, and the things that you will learn and discover, within the imparted time (meaning, the rest of your life). \r\n<p>Explore a world constantly building around you, try to unravel its most hidden secrets, or spend your life looking for your soulmate...Set your own objectives and live the life you choose. One may not be enough, tho!</p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve all this, you'll have to meet other people, learn from them and from yourself. But learning means sacrificing big slices of life, which is a precious currency, especially as time is constantly running against you...</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p><strong>Move</strong> - WASD / ZQSD / Arrows</p>\n<p><strong>Spend time</strong> - Space bar / Left Click on button</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><em>Devs note : Here we go again for another Ludum Dare. No exception made, we had a ton of fun developing that game. It's kind of a \"premiere\" for us to look for such a moody, experience-driven game for a Jam.<br/>We really hope that you will enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it!<br/>There are a lot of different endings in the game. Let's see if you are able to find them all ;)</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Any comments or feedbacks are, of course &amp; as usual, more than welcome!</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Mathieu Clavel &amp; Louis Denizet</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/066602594108a40fd2f283e97c7fcc47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ekilibr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
