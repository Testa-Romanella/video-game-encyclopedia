Then you should definitely try this game! But if you get tired of suffering alone, then you can play together on the same computer. Twice as many players! Twice the pain! Twice the fun !!!<br/>Choose a spaceship to your taste and go ahead to destroy hordes of invaders. On the way, you will improve your ship, and become stronger and stronger if you can pick up a good bonus, because the game also contains bonuses that worsen your ship (and your partner's ship, so don't screw up).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T03:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b75074d44fd7dff82c97b1ba37fd1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crooked Road"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
