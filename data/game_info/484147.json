This is the largest game I've ever attempted to make. As always, thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/>WASD to move, E to interact, Escape to instantly quit.</p>\n<p>Questions and Answers:<br/>-When will the final game\u00a0be released? When it is ready. One year at the latest.<br/></p>\n<p>-Is this part done? Nope, a lot of it will be updated/redone.</p>\n<p>-Why doesn't the story make sense? Probably because it is randomized. The order of every play-through is randomized. This will be a major feature in the final game, with the collectible eyes (I call them \"Bridges\") being key to organizing them.</p>\n<p>-Where can I follow updates on this? I'll be trying to post regular/significant updates on my twitter and possibly on itch as well.</p>\n<p>Sound credits (All from Freesound.org):\u00a0<br/>-Desert Wind -\u00a0 \"Wind, Soft.
