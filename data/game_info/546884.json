{"id": 546884, "slug": "police-mission-chief-cop-game", "name": "Police Mission Chief Cop Game", "name_original": "Police Mission Chief Cop Game", "description": "Enjoy the most realistic police dispatcher simulation at your finger tips! Plan and create your very own dispatch center and place police stations in familiar precincts, using real life maps. You want a faithful representation of real life police locations? Or would you rather build a police headquarters right on top of the Madison Square Garden? It is all up to you!<br/>You will begin with a police station and a patrol car. Afterwards you can expand your justice system any way you want. Add more specialist vehicles like the FBI surveillance or bomb technician vehicles, sheriff units or expand your police force further with SWAT and K9 units and cover a wide variety of dispatch calls!<br/>The game allows for vast customization, so all stations and vehicles can be named. And as some specialized vehicles need trained personnel, you can set up training courses and assign specialists to specific vehicles. Advanced players can use police helicopters to get to the most urgent calls quickly!<br/>If you enjoy teamwork then help friends by joining or creating an alliance. You can share missions to help each other out as well as allow friends to take detainees to your prison. A bigger network that you control will boost your call amount too, increasing the challenges you face. Remember, some calls will require different types of units to be sent so ensure your fleet is up-to-date!<br/>Staying true to our passion of simulation games, it has always been important to have realistic missions with authentic demands for vehicles and units - from small missions like patrolling the river to big ones like a massive prison riot - all on real life maps!<br/>Naturally a lot of our players are also working for a variety of police organizations in real life. This is the perfect game for fans of the blue force!<br/>Finally, we want to let you know that we are always interested in ideas for new missions, vehicles and other content. Just give us a note in a review, contact us on Facebook or send us an email. We cannot implement everything but we strive to realize the valuable input from our players. We are working hard and very closely with our community - to expand the game with you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T05:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b5b894942698264dd99f64b7a5636e1_lPGPzZe.jpg", "website": "https://police.missionchief.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SHPlay"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SHPlay"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
