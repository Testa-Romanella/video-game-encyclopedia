Thanks for checking out my entry to Ludum Dare 48, theme Deeper and Deeper. I wanted to try and keep the jam short, only a few hours each day, but I had to go over the 2 days for compo and do some on the Monday.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was made with the Godot Game Engine, and in a total of about 16 hours of work. All visuals, music, sound effects, programming, and design by me! Connor! Also known on Github as Chillen and Twitter as ChillenLD.</p>\n<p>I know it's definitely rough around the edges, and I didn't quite get the gameplay loop fleshed out, but I'm pretty happy with the result as a toy at least. If you do like it, I'd love to hear! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942a49a63c4e211e880549c9be97370b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chillen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
