Each level is procedurally generated and with each level completion, the game of each succeeding level becomes longer and more challenging. The player controls a ball that must make it to the end of the course marked by a flag. Once the player reaches that flag, the level will complete and the game continues onto the next level. If the player touches any of the red obstacles, the game will end and will restart back to a procedurally generated level 1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71bd6fb84403b6dfc6a590612489cef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jiarguet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
