The point of the jam was to make a game were the only way to interact with it is a button with \"fun\" written on it. Click the button to switch between a metal and a bouncy ball. Hold the button for one second to restart the level.</p>\n<p>There are 9 levels at the moment. I hope you enjoy, and please leave your feedback in the comments (This is my first game, so please be gentle). I hope the mac and linux versions work,because i couldn't test them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T06:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b474630ad36eb889ff34497b07b614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["exothermic games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
