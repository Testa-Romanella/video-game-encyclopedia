{"id": 300702, "slug": "platinum-kill", "name": "Platinum Kill", "name_original": "Platinum Kill", "description": "Platinum Kill is a fast-paced run and gun action game done in a pseudo retro style that blends nostalgia of classic games from this genre with more modern sensibilities of today\u2019s games, all while never taking itself too seriously. You and up to three friends will take on evil across seven unique levels using a plethora of wild weapons and weapon upgrades in order to save the world from a vague yet imposing threat. The enemies are plentiful, the mid-bosses occasional, and the end bosses huge and imposing (except for the cat boss, he\u2019s just adorable).", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c2/2c27bbf98ab7a42844d52d6fc63ff145.jpg", "website": "http://www.funinfused.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fun Infused Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fun Infused Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
