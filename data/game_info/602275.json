Pressing \"action\" again sets the power level and the slider will start moving back to the right, when you press \"action\" for the third time it will set the direction, hitting on the yellow or white dashes will send your ball forward, hitting to the sides of the white dashes will hook or slice the ball into the opposite direction. each character has different control levels making the slider move at different speeds. Each character also has their own abilities, for example the robot has lots of power but no sand wedge making it difficult to exit the sand. The panda is good on the fairway but has no power on any other surface. the frog is able to shoot from the water. Don't mistake these as bugs. There is a description of each characters abilities above them on the character select screen. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHolding down the fast rotation will rotate the direction fast or rotate without holding for more precise movement.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll the gameplay for this game has been defined but I will continue to polish and fix bugs daily, Thank you for your support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T02:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb0a67f921003ae6909966676d57598.jpg", "website": "https://tecmiba.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tecmiba"], "genres": ["Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tecmiba"], "esrb_rating": null}
