So I polished it a bit, removed the gimmick (which wasn't very good) and uploaded it here.\u00a0Please comment below if you have questions, a\u00a0leaderboards score (please tell the truth),\u00a0glitch reports\u00a0(though i may not be able to fix them), if the game doesn't work for some reason,\u00a0suggestions, or anything else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Basic Rules: W, A, S, and D to move, hold down shift + W to run,\u00a0left click to shoot the zombies\u00a0(but keep an eye on your ammo), and turn by moving the mouse. Get glowing blue ammo cans to add 30 to your ammo, and get a health point back by getting the red glowing can. There are three different types of enemies, but I'll let you figure those out yourself! Thank you, and have fun blasting zombies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/393ca79d016e32086826eb1bdcd7f1a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Elliotawesome"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
