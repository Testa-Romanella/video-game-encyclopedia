Stone is a weak point, so aim for it aggressively.<br/>- Escape and take a break so that Serval's stamina is not exhausted.<br/>- Fight in cooperation with Friends. It is dangerous to go ahead alone.<br/>- If Serval's level is below the recommended level, it is recommended to grinding.<br/>- As the game progresses, you will be able to use Wild Release. It is a good idea to use Wild Release aggressively.<br/>- If the application is slow to respond, apply \"Config\"-&gt; \"Change settings at once\"-&gt; \"Medium (Low) Quality Settings\".<br/>- If Serval's running speed is too fast to control, change \"Config\"-&gt; \"Control &amp; Battle\"-&gt; \"Friends' running speed\".<br/>- If you want to use items continuously, turn on \"Config\"-&gt; \"Control &amp; Battle\"-&gt; \"Continuous use of items\".<br/>- If you are dissatisfied with the camera work, change \"Config\"-&gt; \"Camera\"-&gt; \"Camera turning speed\", \"Camera FOV\", and so on.<br/>- If you find the action difficult, change \"Config\"-&gt; \"Accessibility\"-&gt; \"Simplify dodge command\", \"Simplify skill command\", and so on.<br/>- If the screen becomes cluttered due to Friends, turn on \"Config\"-&gt; \"Accessibility\"-&gt; \"Obscure Friends\".<br/>- If you find the game difficult even with NT difficulty, lower \"Config\"-&gt; \"Accessibility\"-&gt; \"Game speed\".<h3>## QA</h3>- Depending on the environment, you may not be able to start the game.<br/>  Approach (1): Add the game folder and files to the exception / exclusion list of the antivirus program.<br/>  Approach (2): Right-click the exe file and select [Run as administrator].<br/>  Approach (3): Update the video / graphics driver and Windows operating system.<br/>  Approach (4): Update DirectX.<br/><br/>- Depending on the PC's environment, the characters may become transparent.<br/>  Approach (1) Update graphics board driver.<br/>  Approach (2) Install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017\" at the following URL.<br/>  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/<br/><br/>- Depending on the PC's environment, grass may not be displayed in the dungeon, and red purple plate may be displayed.<br/>  Approach: Move the floor while turning Off \"Show grass\" in Config/High-cost process.<br/><br/>- Depending on the PC's environment, the screen may turn all white or all black at a specific location.<br/>  Approach: Change the \"Anti-aliasing\" in Config/Effect.<br/><br/>- Depending on the PC's environment, the screen may temporarily stop when the camera goes behind a wall.<br/>  Approach: Change the \"Hide obscuring walls\" in Config/Show or Hide to Off or \"ON (Low Cost)\".<br/><br/>- The location of save data is<br/>  (for Windows)<br/>  C:/Users/[User Name]/AppData/LocalLow/KirisameZensen/KemonoFriendsCMC/KirisameZensen.KemonoFriendsCMC.savedata.json<br/>  (for Mac)<br/>  ~/Library/Application Support/KirisameZensen/KemonoFriendsCMC/KirisameZensen.KemonoFriendsCMC.savedata.json<br/>  (The file may not be visible if the hidden attribute is enabled.)<br/><br/>- If you bring the save data from another computer, you may not be able to write the save data.<br/>  Approach: Cancel the read-only attribute of the save data.<br/><br/>- There are no restrictions on game introductions and live broadcasts.<h3>## How to use MOD</h3><strong># How to change music:</strong><br/>1.
