Oh hell, it's Sir Morpheus. We're screwed.</p>\n<p>PUZZLE KNIGHT is a delightfully addictive and mysterious puzzle-platformer by Foreach Games. Take control of Sir Morpheus, the world\u2019s most dimwitted yet enthusiastic knight, and guide him through a gigantic maze-like forest whilst solving fantastical puzzles and beating the holy snot out of goblins.</p>\n<p>Morpheus is the ideal human specimen, he has both a perfectly spherical torso and an empty head. This leaves him in an excellent position to both defend his big boned body against attacks and have one less weak spot to defend, what more could one ask for? Perhaps the rest of world disagrees, but he\u2019s their only hope now. With your guidance, the world will surely be saved. Are you up for the challenge?</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Puzzle Knight has now been fully released.\u00a0 There will minimal updates from this point forward and only minor gameplay issues and bugs will be addressed.\u00a0 If you would like to get more info on future updates or other Puzzle Knight info visit our website and other media links below.<br/></p>\n<p>Contact: media@puzzleknightgame.com <br/>Facebook<br/>Twitter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c56e3539a1b43b460340ccc65efa1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ForeachGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
