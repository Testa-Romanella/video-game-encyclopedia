It's a great app for babies, toddlers, and little kids (I made it for my 2 year old son :) ).<br/><br/>If you have a group, here's a fun game to try:<br/><br/>Open the app, prop it up where everyone can see the light, and just follow the prompts: red means stop, yellow means move arms but not legs, and green means walk.<br/><br/>All you need to do to get started is open the app (which begins with a red light), and wait until it turns green to GO!<br/><br/>A counter appears at the bottom of the screen which shows you how much time is left until the light changes, and once 5 seconds are left, little beeps lets you know to start revving your engines. You can also force a light change by just tapping the top, middle, or bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>If you want the Virtual Stop Light to take a break, just press the pause button at the top of the screen.<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cba47a0efb70dbe7c5d87b07400d294_2ehcrp9.jpg", "website": "https://lionheartsw.com/software/stop-light/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lionheart Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Family"], "publishers": ["Lionheart Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
