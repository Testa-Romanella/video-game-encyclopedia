There is no UI at all yet but if there was you'd see 2 percentages on the left side od the screen one is the number you have to rech thor other how many percentages you have. If your amount is lower then the goal by the time the obsacle hits you, you loose(or at least you should because i just noticed while writing this that i forgot to implement it). you can raise your percentages by killling the enemies on the right side of the screen.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controlls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D \u00a0- movement</p>\n<p>Space \u00a0 \u00a0- \u00a0 \u00a0Attack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa2bb4e396afc3f65a7980cea592036a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cowgummiboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
