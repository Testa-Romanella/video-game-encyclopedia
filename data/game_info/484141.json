( The smoke was also modeled in Houdini).<br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>We wanted to create a game color blindness friendly, so we try to use colors that are not confusing.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>We are <strong>Fuimos Nosotros</strong>, a Mexican couple of developers (David Ville as Technical Artist and Programer, and Katia Orozco as Artist).</p>\n<p> Despite having had a very heavy week of work, we gave ourselves the chance to participate in the jam in our spare time each day.
