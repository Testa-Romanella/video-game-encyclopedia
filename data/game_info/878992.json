{"id": 878992, "slug": "become-dirt", "name": "Become Dirt", "name_original": "Become Dirt", "description": "<p>This game represents a concept for a narrative-driven exploration horror adventure about discovering a family's dysfunctions, history, and finding a way to survive in horrifying conditions. <br/></p>\n<p>This version is a brief proof-of-concept that contains examples of the game's story, exploration, aesthetic, and some limited features. The game will end when you click the small hatch/door to the basement in the floor of the siblings' room. While this is a short experience, we hope that you find it interesting - we'd love to complete this and fully implement all of our ideas someday, but for now please enjoy this brief teaser and thank you for playing!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD - Move <br/>E - Interact / Advance Dialogue<br/>Left CTRL - Crouch<br/></p>\r\nDevelopment by Team Fear Queers\r\n<p><strong>Programming</strong>: Parsely, Piper<br/><strong>Music</strong>: Anonymous<br/><strong>Sound Effects</strong>: Anonymous &amp; Runa Liore Winters<br/><strong>Art</strong>: Bree, Skye 'silentscarlet' Smith, Taylor<br/><strong>Character Design</strong>:\u00a0Bree<br/><strong>Environmental Art</strong>: Skye 'silentscarlet' Smith<br/><strong>Writing &amp; Production</strong>: Runa Liore Winters<br/></p>\r\nAttributions\r\n<p>HPS1 Render Pipeline - https://github.com/pastasfuture/com.hauntedpsx.render-pipelines.psx<br/></p>\n<p>Mansion Asset Pack - https://porkbellygames.itch.io/retro-mansion-assets</p>\n<p>Feverdream Johnny's Impact Controller - https://github.com/FeverDevJohnny/impactcontroller<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T12:13:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfec1bf51f8efb01ee3d262b621caec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["silentscarlet", "Runa Liore", "chasay", "ParselyBunny", "Bree Wolf", "tdin3d"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
