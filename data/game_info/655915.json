Can you save the townsfolk or will the horde triumph?</p>\n<p>This is my entry to the Brackey's 2021 game jam completed over 7 days in August.\u00a0 The theme was \"let there be chaos\" and this certainly can be chaotic driving a digger between buildings and cars trying to find zombies that are slowly decimating the townsfolk while trying not to run over the very people you're trying to save.\u00a0The majority of the art and models are mine although the buildings and cars were originally created for Casual Pursuit. The\u00a0character models, and the digger were modelled during the game jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>w, a, s, d to drive the digger.</li><li>arrows to turn the cab and extend and retract the boom and bucket.</li><li>Escape to pause the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the digger boom and bucket like a club, but be careful not to hit any of your fellow citizens.</li><li>The zombies will come in multiple waves, use the mini-map to work out where they are coming from.</li><li>Try to kill all the zombies and keep the citizens alive.</li><li>The game ends when all of the zombie waves have been defeated, or all of the citizens have perished.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:58:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26bdf572c9145e3f9bbefa05e9f12ac4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Curious Dog Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
