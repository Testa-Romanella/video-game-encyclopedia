Your good friend Sindell, an elvish mage, believes he has found the source of why the Void Lords destroyed the city.</p>\n<p>The caverns under Old Bookfall grow ancient Crystals called Luminites. These crystals hold an ancient power, capable of purging Void essence. Sindell believes that the mages of old Brookfall were not able to unlock that power before the destruction, however he believes he can.</p>\n<p>On arrival, you notice you are too late, the void Lords have already discovered the area has re-opened and are opening void rifts throughout the cavern.\u00a0However... They havent made an appearance yet.
