Fred only ever wanted to get to the finish without falling down. But there is one problem - he is VERY clumsy when it comes to running fast, even the slightest obstacle can make him trip and fall down. Poor guy! Will you help Fred out?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nClumsy Fred is a ragdoll physics based simulation 3D game where you step in the shoes of Fred and follow him on his strange endeavours to learn how to run without falling, while overcoming different challenges and obstacles. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have a time limit to get to the finish. Be careful of the obstacles, because collision drains your health and, more importantly, costs you time if you fall. If you do not make it in time you have to restart the level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGo trough each checkpoint, avoiding obstacles, until you reach the finish within the time limit. Upon reaching the finish line you will unlock a new level of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Ragdoll physics<br/>\r\n- Unique 3D models<br/>\r\n- Cool animations<br/>\r\n- Many obstacles and challenges<br/>\r\n- Funny sound effects<br/>\r\n- Intuitive controls<br/>\r\n- VERY fun to play<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic by: dl-sounds.com<br/>\r\nCar physics and model made with: Edy's Vehicle Physics<br/>\r\nRoad made with: EasyRoads3D Pro", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c5b4a3e12bd2469a1087013d21b17ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["BeshevGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BeshevGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
