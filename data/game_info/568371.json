Due to the number of enemies (and consequently the number of bullets flying across the screen) survival is a long shot. However, as long as you have lives left to give, you will take over whatever enemy destroys you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Directions: W and S keys to drive forward and backward. A and D keys to steer left and right. Aim using your mouse.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for hearts!
