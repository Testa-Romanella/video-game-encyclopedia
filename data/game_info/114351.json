The first 3 levels are the very beginning of the game - both in terms of plot and difficulty, while 2 other levels feature a full set of abilities of all the 4 characters.</p>\n<p>The gameplay idea is to have an experience similar to that of Dota, but where a player controls up to 4 characters at the same time. A focus is on having 2 attack modes - single and multi - that significantly change how characters use their abilities as well as ordinary attacks. Enemy units are divided into minor and major, which forces a player to switch between multi and single attack modes respectively to defeat the units.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the assets including music and UI elements were created from scratch. Currently,\u00a0 mouse and keyboard and XBox 360 controller are supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Any kind of feedback is more than welcome!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Although the tutorial level explains most of the controls, here they are:</em></p>\n\n<strong>Mouse / keyboard</strong><br/>Xbox 360 controller<br/>Action<strong>Left mouse button</strong>N / ASelect an object<strong>Right mouse button</strong><strong>RB</strong>Order selected units to go to the point or to switch attack target to another enemy<strong>1 2 3 4</strong><strong>D-pad\u00a0<br/>L U R D</strong>Select a respective character<strong>5</strong><strong>LB</strong>Select all characters<strong>Q W E R</strong><strong>X Y B A</strong>Use or select a respective ability of the currently selected character<strong>S</strong><strong>RT + A</strong>Stop selected units, cancel a current destination<strong>D</strong><strong>RT + Y</strong>Put selected units in defense mode<strong>A</strong><strong>RT + X</strong>Switch formation mode between manual and automatic<strong>F</strong><strong>RT + B</strong>Select next major enemy unit as a common target<strong>Space</strong><strong>LT</strong>Switch between single and multi attack modes<strong>Shift + <br/>1 2 3 4\u00a0</strong><strong>RT + <br/>D-pad\u00a0\r\n<br/>L U R D</strong>\u00a0Character multi-select<strong>Alt + Right mouse button</strong>N / ARotate camera<strong>: )</strong><strong>Right stick</strong>Move cursorN / A<strong>Left stick</strong>Scroll camera<strong>Mouse wheel</strong><strong>RT + Left stick</strong>Camera zoom", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674960227255abe9d91ddd63a808e22f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Red Grenade"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
