Inspired by the World of Warcraft, it comprises similar controls and abilities. But of course, don't expect it to feel the same way!\u00a0The purpose of this project was to challenge myself and improve my\u00a0c# programming skills by creating a modular ability system that can be used to create any ability from World of Warcraft. Since this is a prototype, you may experience some\u00a0bugs. If you found a bug, please leave a comment below\u00a0 explaining how to replicate it so that it can be fixed.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>AWSD to move and rotate the character</p>\n<p>Mouse left click to select targets</p>\n<p>Hold mouse left click to pan the camera</p>\n<p>Hold mouse right click to pan the camera and rotate the character</p>\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n<p>Press 1 to use <strong>Healing</strong> ability (must target self first)</p>\n<p>Press 2 to use <strong>Fireball </strong>ability (must have target enemy and be within range!\u00a0)</p>\n<p>Press 3 to use <strong>Charge\u00a0</strong>ability\u00a0(must target enemy and be within range!)</p>\n<p>Press 4 to\u00a0use <strong>Leap </strong>ability\u00a0(Leap is activated by pressing left mouse button)</p>\n<p>Press 5 to\u00a0use <strong>Earthbreak </strong>ability\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press 6 to\u00a0use <strong>Thunder </strong>ability\u00a0(Thunder is activated by pressing left mouse button)</p>\n\n\r\nI hope you have fun playing this prototype!\r\n<p>If you did, please let me know :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T13:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dcaf2df6ef2648371548aec9bb7cb580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nuno Delgado"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
