I have tried to make all the assets myself, however due to lack of time I helped myself with the tools of the software used, a humanoid base skeleton and initial programming, hair, and the 3D model and textures that I made previously during two weeks (from my hands with my moles, bruises and veins). However, the rest I have done everything little by little in these long days.</p>\n<p>Organize myself in the best way and record all my activities and times, save all the original and modifiable files to be able to show that I did everything.</p>\n<p>I started with character design, modeling, hair, textures, clothes, style. Continue with history, dialogues, objectives, losses. Then I did the animations and performance of each character, some of them I recorded the voices (screaming like a gorilla for a whole hour). Then I started doing the 5 songs, thinking about the moment of battle, tranquility, after the battle, dance with my love and gameover (for which I played the piano a little but did not achieve a loop as I wanted).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7ff0bccdea5303da5f00fa7ca61942d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jayikho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
