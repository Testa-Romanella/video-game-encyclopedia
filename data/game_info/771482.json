Unlike other rythm games, you don't have to press the right keys. You can dance the way you want! (Don't miss the beats, though.)</p>\n\n<p>You shouldn't be dancing. But since this is a dancing game, let's dance! Erm... <em>carefully</em>. Otherwise you might get hurt.</p>\n<p>If you don't press anything, the character just vibes to the beat until the end of the song. You win, with a zero score.</p>\n<p>Then you add your moves as you want, to make this dance <em>your</em> dance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But be careful! If you dance in the wrong way, your fragile skeleton might not take it!</p>\n\n\n<p>You may not have the fastest computer, so the game allows you to adjust your latency:</p>\n\n\n<p>Songs featured in the game:</p>\n<p><em>Midnight Groove - Fernando Cosentino</em><br/>Original composition for the game</p>\n<p><em>Cool Lofi Hip Hop - MusicLover419</em><br/>Creative Commons (https://musescore.com/user/30914341/scores/6369692)</p>\n<p><em>Pick Up The Pieces - Ryan DeBruyckere</em><br/>Creative Commons (https://musescore.com/user/16107526/scores/5612447)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T05:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/4182020215ed2a9ab194aaa4783ad1c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mad Parrot Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
