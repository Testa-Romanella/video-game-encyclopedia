You can pick up powerups to destroy as many balls as possible and get a higher score. Try to survive as long as you can!<br/><br/>Play either COOP and work together to get the highest score, or VERSUS to compete to be the last standing.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Controls</h3></strong><br/>We recommend using a gamepad but keyboard is also supported and works great. Simply use the analog sticks or WASD/Arrow keys to move your paddles and hit the balls! Add some more players to spice things up.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Features</h3></strong><br/><ul><li> Two game modes: COOP and VERSUS.<br/></li><li> Fast paced gameplay which gets harder over time<br/></li><li> Easy to learn controls with Keyboard or Gamepad<br/></li><li> 1-4 player local coop (or over remote play together!)<br/></li><li> Character customisation and unlocks!<br/></li><li> Steam leaderboards and achievements<br/></li><li> Great to play whilst waiting in a queue for another game</li></ul><br/><br/><strong><h3>Dev note</h3></strong><br/>I greatly appreciate feedback and will do my best to ensure support for this game.
