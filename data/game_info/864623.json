This story mostly inspired our development process. In this game, all objects are just simple structures with the help of ProBuilder. The player's objective is to navigate the map to find all the coins before going through the door. We used Unity's built-in NavMesh tools to create enemies that would follow the player using the built-in AI engine. The player and the enemies navigate the map with a baked NavMesh. The goal of our development was to explore the possibilites of the\u00a0NavMesh and the Unity AI engine.\u00a0Have fun! Hope there aren't too many bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong></p>\n<p>Mohammed Ajao,\u00a0Justin Li,\u00a0Jeffery Tse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c277e60c7b55ffb0cc76751d29fe1268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["hydrofuelcell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
