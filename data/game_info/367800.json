So as a player you need to make noise in order to see the world and make your way through abandoned structures and puzzles to find your way back home.</p>\n<p>LowPolyGames Team:</p>\n<p>Will Dixon</p>\n<p>Daniel Dennis</p>\n<p>John Weightman</p>\n<p>Tim Weightman</p>\n<p>Twitter:</p>\n<p>John Weightman -\u00a0@HF97Damnation</p>\n<p>Will Dixon -\u00a0@WillomenaIV</p>\n<p>Daniel Dennis -\u00a0@dendan_LoL</p>\n<p>Emails:</p>\n<p>Team Email - LowPolyGames@protonmail.com</p>\n<p>Will Dixon -\u00a0WillGDixon@Gmail.com</p>\n<p>Daniel Dennis -\u00a0 DMDennis@protonmail.com</p>\n<p>John Weightman - JohnCWeightman@Gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/928/928682f66142f502429d91b6692d41ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LowPolyGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
