Heavily inspired by Sagittarius by George Prosser, so I'd definitely recommend checking him out at https://gprosser.itch.io/</p>\n<p>I'm part of PenWing Studios, a small collaboration between me (the programmer),\u00a0Separate_Shelter\u00a0(the composer), who made the background music, and\u00a0salty_bac0n (the artist), who will be working on future art-heavy games. More people might be helping later, so look out for their names showing up!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this first little project, and stick around for more in future months (we'll be doing one game a month until 2021).</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in the code, look at our github repo, and if you want to post any comments, concerns, reviews, or ideas for future games go to our subreddit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e66d65b5355ca73f569ea61ea9b91606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flber"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
