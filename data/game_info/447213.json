I made it hoping to bring some cheer to everyone's lives amidst the current coronavirus outbreak and stay-home situation.</p>\n<p>No complicated plot or unexpected twists here, but <em>please help rescue the Dust Bunny babies</em>! Along the way, do also enjoy the art (painstakingly hand-drawn by me) and\u00a0read the level titles (maybe they form a message? *wink wink).</p>\n<p>Playing time can be short or long depending on how much difficulty you have completing the levels. Cool gameplay mechanics include the ability to <em>defy gravity</em> heheh :3\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Last but definitely not least, credits\u00a0to the artists of the audio files I've used in my game:<br/>Vacuum2.wav by phatkatz4<br/>Small_Adventurers.mp3 by ShadyDave<br/>Cheery_Whistling.mp3 by Yin_Yang_Jake007<br/>Squeal_Squeak_Thing.wav by Reitanna Seishin<br/>Success_Fanfare_Trumpets.mp3 by FunWithSound</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you like my game and want to support me, do share it with your family and friends! :D</strong> ...and though I don't drink coffee, you can always buy me a Milo by donating any amount you wish~</em></p>\n<p>---------<br/>Developer's Notes:</p>\n<ul><li>The game may take a while to load in the browser so please be patient :) If not, you can always download the game files (available for Windows and Mac)\u00a0under the downloads section.</li><li>While playing each level, try not to randomly click the middle of the screen unless directed to, otherwise it may cause you to restart the level. Clicking the screen is okay in the prologue and epilogue sections though!</li><li>There's no pause or save feature, so try to complete the game in one sitting.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667e31372432e060ed3d561922f912d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
