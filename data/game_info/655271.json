There are different layers to the level, \u00a0you are encouraged to explore but technically do not have to, and can beat the game fairly easily if you take the safest above ground route.</p>\n<p>The second theme about the water and submerged objects phobia, made Moreau from RE8 (the \"fish man\") a perfect part of the game to remake. \u00a0So you are a villager and it is the part of the game with Moreau, Moreau included!<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and playing! Hope you enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd867e9fb77d8f2166a6e913d4907109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kouda Ha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
