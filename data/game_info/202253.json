Do you hate waiting in lines at trade shows, industry conferences, the DMV,\u00a0or the free clinic? Well despair no more, oh ye of little patience -\u00a0\u00a0introducing the Wait Shake!</p>\n<p>The Wait Shake! is a device that puts the \"fun\"\u00a0in \"fundamentally poor event layout design\"! The small handheld controller acts as a transmitter, sending acceleration data to a receiver connected to a dynamic image displayed on large video monitors or projected onto a wall. Guests pick up the controller, give it a shake, and watch the accompanying image change right before their eyes! Waiting has never been so interactive!</p>\n<p>Wait Shake! uses two micro:bit controllers to send acceleration data over radio waves from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver then sends that data into TouchDesigner via serial port, which is translated into a channel data stream that can be used to drive all sorts of things:\u00a0color changes, image and object placement, and even real-time generative effects!</p>\n<p>Built with:</p>\n<ul><li>micro:bit microcontrollers</li><li>TouchDesigner 088</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Python</li></ul>\n<p>Transmitter: https://makecode.microbit.org/_Ax9fYkDCicLk<br/></p>\n<p>Receiver:\u00a0https://makecode.microbit.org/_if4gYqJjkYH1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/60595ce3ba90d790230ddf63c81a83b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenParisot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
