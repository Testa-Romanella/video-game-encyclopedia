She likes reading and visiting museums and old temples. He likes beer and farting.</p>\n<p>One day they were on a tour in Egypt visiting the Great Pyramid, and while they were taking one last picture of a majestic statue, they got separated from the rest of the tour. When Felicie realised they were alone, she started panicking, as usual. George, calm as ever, told her \"As Confucius said, all that goes up needs to go down... we came all the way up here and now we just need to go down this pyramid and find the exit\". Little did he know that the pyramid is cursed and infested with creatures. Will they ever find the exit?</p>\r\nNeed your feedback\r\n<p>The game is currently in active development and we're looking for feedback on the demo build.\u00a0The demo currently only has one theme and one boss.
