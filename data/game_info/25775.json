Ride as fast as \n      you can to pass as many cars and bikes as possible while also avoiding \n      obstacles and pitfalls such as debris on the road. Take jumps off of \n      ramps and try to keep your speed up, but make sure to keep an eye on \n      your bike so it doesn\u2019t blow up in your face! Are you ready for the \n      challenge?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
