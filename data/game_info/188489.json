Currently it is a very rough prototype, may not even be playable. \u00a0I wish I had more time to finish it.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make roguelike comic book about a murder story happened in a bar. The story is procedurally generated with Answer Set Programming solver clingo. The player and the AI take turns to make choices on the plots. The player's goal is to achieve a (randomly) given narrative objective, while the AI may be disturbing the plots.</p>\n<p>Currently there are only 3 actions that characters can do in the story, and hardly any really interesting plots are likely to be generated with this limited number of choices.\u00a0 This prototype just gives you a rough idea.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm sure I'll get back to it one day.</p>\n<p>Sprites were made by\u00a0@wwwshou.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71f8ca5d5e908e36a298df08289e0e6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["junjunlowpoly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
