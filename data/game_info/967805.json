Take control of a small boat as you navigate through various arenas, armed with your trusty weapons. But be warned - the enemy pool floats are out to get you! Engage in intense battles as you shoot and destroy these inflatable foes, testing your reflexes and aiming skills. Immerse yourself in the thrilling world of boat combat. Survive challenging fights and show off your boat-shooting skills today!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, you play as a little toy boat that is trying to defend its pool from an evil toy fish invasion. <br/>\r\nEach level begins in a different pool with different obstacles, styles, and decorations, teeming with enemies. At first glance, the enemies look somewhat funny as they are fishes with guns that apparently do not belong in your pool. Once the fishes have spotted you they start moving towards you and start shooting at you with relatively slow flying bullets. You are able to outmaneuver your enemies by simply dodging their bullets or diving beneath them. Then you can use your front or side cannons to fight back the evil fishes by shooting at them. At the end of each level waits a big toy starfish with more energy and bigger bullets. You have 3 lives before the game end, so be careful not to get hit by a bullet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T03:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a922bf827bf46b429eb1a57ddb32af.jpg", "website": "https://www.epixrgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
