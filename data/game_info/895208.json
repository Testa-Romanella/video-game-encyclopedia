Would like to explore the concept further but don't have any free time to do so. I know the game has a lot of bugs so please don't tell me something is broken because I\u00a0am not a programmer and a lot of the game is held together by tape.</p>\n\n<p>AGAIN THIS IS BASICALLY A TECH DEMO SO IT CAN BE BEATEN IN LIKE 5 MINUTES IF YOU'RE FAST ENOUGH.</p>\n\n<p>Story: You are a little boy lost in the woods, you don't remember who you are or how you got here but you seem to have a crayon and a notebook that can help you connect the dots and find your way out of here. Find pages, meet fun characters, and make decisions to figure out who you were and who you want to be! (again as of right now the game is mostly a tech demo with very light story elements so don't go into it thinking it will be a full experience.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T12:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/3479012a5a8b3a3446edb2c325ee6be4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePherf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
