You may be forced to consider the morals of killing countless people for your own survival and realize that humans where the real monsters all along or you may think its a fun game with a funny looking pixel dude.\u00a0\u00a0This game will require you to make quick decisions using WAD to move and jump with the addition of pressing S to fast fall for tight maneuvers\u00a0well using E to dash and clicking to shoot your Grenade launcher like a real American. You will need to aim your shots well unless you want\u00a0to die in real life.\u00a0If you die to some BS it is your fault for making the wrong\u00a0decision and not bad game design on Elliott Sussman's Part. This game is extremely rewarding to beat and feathers great original music by Elliott Sussman\u00a0you can play it your self by downloading and unzipping the attached file.\u00a0And don't forget once you enter\u00a0the\u00a0Gauntlet you can never truley leave it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0ac37149058faadba741740694d8f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["savagepanda65"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
