To do this, move your units to the nearby sector (hexagon) by clicking on it, and then clicking on sector you want to move. When you done it, press space to end your turn, you can move all your sectors at time!, fighting is similar, just move units to enemy sector. Thats it!</p>\r\nFrom author\r\n<p>Right now it`s only a prototype, so all can be changed (and name also) If you interested in project, please write coments with feedback, and maybe with description of bugs you found.
