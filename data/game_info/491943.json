{"id": 491943, "slug": "zeroed", "name": "ZEROED", "name_original": "ZEROED", "description": "Speed. Spectacle. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Those were literally the first words written when creating the concept for this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI noticed most fast-paced racers tend to have claustrophobic and dark environments. The goal behind ours was to open it up to natural, bright scenery. Early on in that mission I discovered another change I wanted to make: I hate hitting walls while playing any fast-paced game. My answer to that? Remove the walls!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo our on-road racer became a flying racer... On a rail? Kind of hard to explain but the harder something is to explain, the more unique the concept is, right? Imagine being on a roller coaster but you have the ability to choose which side of the track you're on. Add to that the idea that if you're on the inside of each bend of the track, you maintain more of your speed. Then give yourself some weapon options that explode in beautiful color and you've got this game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently there is one online mode to play against your friends and other available players, and one offline mode where you can test yourself against CPU opponents. Pretty sparse, huh? Well, we're the most interested in your feedback of this conceptually at this point. If the general consensus is that it's fun to play, we've got plenty of additional modes to introduce in the near future!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo grab a controller (this game plays far, far better with one!), pick a color, choose a track and let 'er rip! When you're done, feel free to leave your opinion a review and/or join our Discord to let us know directly what you thought!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T08:13:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd4c5a7842845c8e1b801b3612c0968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whats Good Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Whats Good Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
