The area is surrounded by a pollution fog that blocks sunlight from reaching the earth and prevents greenery from growing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Start off by restoring a small block of land by planting and farming. Expand your farm by gathering resources (seeds, metal, parts, etc.) from your surroundings and gather parts to build wind turbines that can blow away the fog. Grow and build your way as you eventually get to the powerplant/factory that is creating the fog and turn it off.</p>\n<p>Make sure to grab and stay in the bursts of sunlight that shine down between the gaps in the fog to charge up the battery, pick up battery packs on your excursions to keep going and pick up more spare parts and resources. If the battery runs out the robot dies and its game over.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Task 1:\u00a0Collect material to plant and grow seeds into plants.</p>\n<p>Task 2: Collect material to craft other items, craft enough items to craft 4 solar turbines (See menu in-game).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Task 3: Turn off the power plant!</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>TEAM</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Designer - Atash Qasim</p>\n<p>Programmer - Dinesh</p>\n<p>Programmer - Richard Suarez</p>\n<p>3D Artist - Steven Boyle</p>\n<p>3D Artist - Callum Park</p>\n<p>Audio - Harry Steele</p>\n<p>Audio - Jamie Petersen</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>Game Jam Build is missing completed art and audio assets which the team worked hard to create but run out of time to include. The game is also not balanced and is missing some design elements like recharging of the battery, maintaining plants etc.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T08:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121490cd5573715230f8f6563c4c34c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RS_Games", "Stebo", "atash55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
