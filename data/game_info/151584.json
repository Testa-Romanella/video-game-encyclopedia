Now it\u2019s back, and it\u2019s back in style. With updated features, graphics and sound effects. There are now 3 game modes to experience and enjoy through a multistage campaign.\u00a0</p>\n<p> <strong>Classic \u2013 </strong>Just want the classic Pong experience with updated ascetics then this game mode will give you that.   </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for something a bit different then try out the other 2 game modes inside of Retro Remix.   </p>\n<p><strong>Defender \u2013 </strong>Puts a small spin on the classic Pong experience by having shields that are placed in the field of play. These shields can be turned to your colour doing so will make the ball deflect back at the opponent if they hit it with one of their shots.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Domination</strong> \u2013 Is the biggest departure from the classic Pong formula. The main aim isn\u2019t about getting the ball past your opponent (although it helps) it\u2019s about using the ball to dominate the grid that appears on the playing field. The more of the gird you own the more points you\u2019ll get at the end of the fast-pasted timer\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>UNIVERSITY OF CHESTER PROJECT DETAILS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game was developed by Grant Mullock for our Advanced Games Theory and Implementation module.
