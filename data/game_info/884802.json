{"id": 884802, "slug": "touch-the-balls-vr", "name": "Touch the Balls VR", "name_original": "Touch the Balls VR", "description": "Imagine a world where all that surrounds you are bright colorful balls... now imagine touching, burning, blowing up (<strong>more dramatic descriptors</strong>) those balls until there's nothing left! That's right, it's up to you to destroy as many balls as you possibly can, but be careful, because you only have one chance! If even one ball hits the ground (unless of course you have an oh-so-wonderful extra life powerup), then it's game over!<br/><br/>Enjoy <strong>SIX</strong> unique levels to set high scores on and to take in the scene. Tired of touching balls all by your lonesome? Show your friends how much better at touching them than they are! That's right, just join a session with a friend on any level and see who can last the longest!<br/><br/>Haven't sold it yet have I? Well quite honestly if touching balls with your friends in VR isn't enough to sell this genius idea, then nothing will. Good day to you sir/madam.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T04:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e33/e33270256b9d49c25a9761e658a644d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bare Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bare Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
