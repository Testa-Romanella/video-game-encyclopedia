{"id": 161731, "slug": "ab2-monsters-and-bones", "name": "AB2 - Monsters and Bones", "name_original": "AB2 - Monsters and Bones", "description": "<p>Welcome to the second game in the Amazonian Battles series. Games in this series are short casual turn based tactical combat games which can easily be played in less then an hour. Your objective in this game is to simply destroy all the monsters in the dungeon. Two new types of monsters were added in this game. The first is a Bladded Skeleton: This opponent uses a sword for more damage, has a lesser chance of hitting and moves a shorter distance each turn. The second is a Normal Skeleton: This opponent uses its claws to attack, has a higher chance of hitting, does less damage but can move further each turn. In addition to these new opponents you will also face more goblins and bane dogs (first introduced in AB1). You must first select your units (there are seven units available to choose from) and then deploy your units. The available units to choose from are as follows: Amazon Archer: This unit has the smallest amount of life points but uses a bow and can attack enemies from a distance. Amazon Battler: This unit uses a two handed sword and does the most damage but has the worst defense. Amazon Gladiator: This unit gets two attacks each round but each attack only does a small amount of damage. Amazon Mauler: This unit uses a hammer and is reasonable at attacks but is the best at defending. Amazon Scrapper: This unit is good at attacking but is not that good at defending. Amazon Skirmisher: This unit is considered to be the average soldier in attacking and defending. Amazon Warrior: This unit has more life points and is good at attacking while being reasonable at defending. After deploying your units you will be able to take your first turn where you either move each of your units, attack enemy units in range or both. More enemies, items and other game components will be added in each new game released in the series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/69430c89bba16ae3e107bdbd5a6651f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["blueFireDistrib"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
