Things are shifting between them. Q may or may not be sporting a massive crush on the agent. Will he be able to make a move? How is this week going to change his daily life?</p>\n\n<p>Cheesy story, simple characterization, simple dialogues.<br/></p>\n<p>&gt; THREE ENDINGS with only one true ending.</p>\n<p>&gt; GAMEPLAY TIME: 15-20 minutes</p>\n<p>&gt; AUTHOR\u2019S NOTE: There are two major flaws in this game. You\u2019ll notice the quality of the art falls short sometimes, alas, it was a rushed project I couldn\u2019t devote all of my time to and that I wanted to post it as soon as possible. The second one is that it falls short as a visual novel. It\u2019s more of a fanfiction than a\u00a0challenging VN. Its primary audience is the 00q fandom, I can\u2019t guarantee it would be very fun if you\u2019re not into 00q, but of course, I\u2019d be very happy if you gave it a chance.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t hesitate to leave a comment, I\u2019m very eager to know what you thought of it!</p>\n<p>&gt; CREDITS: Huge thanks to artificial.music for letting me use their beautiful work.
