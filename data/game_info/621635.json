In the heat, children need this cold treat to stay fresh, but the high temperatures may make simply walking to these stands a hussle. That's where Gustavo, the ice cream man of the docks excels, using an umbrella to escort the children to his stands. He does it for money, of course, but it's still kinda noble.</p>\n<p>In the game, your goal is to bring the kids to your stand.\u00a0The children will walk by your side, but will stop when the dock ends, and will be left behind. Use this mechanic\u00a0to position them, so\u00a0they can follow you to your objective.</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam, with the theme \"Joined Together\". The game was made within the 48 hour time window, using SDL2 (and SDL mixer for the\u00a0version with sound).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e28176ac35c2216c5b50477f51e5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuja"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
