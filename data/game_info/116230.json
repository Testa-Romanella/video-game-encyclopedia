Green squares reverses the movement relationship.<br/></p><p>This game is a prototype. But the response I got for it was positive, so I decided to work on it more. Currently there are 22 levels in the game.</p><p>Semicontrol is open source. If you want to see the source, download semicontrol.love, rename it to semicontrol.zip and unzip it. A L\u00d6VE file is actually a renamed zip archive.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Movement: Arrow keys (On Android swipe to the desired direction and release, wasd if you have an external keyboard.)</p><p>Fullscreen: F11</p><p>Refresh level: F5</p><p>Return to menu/Quit: Escape</p><p>Start game: Space</p><p>Music on/off: M</p><p>Sound on/off: F<br/></p><p>Win32 and Win64 files come with the required binaries. If you run Linux, you need to install L\u00d6VE (love2d). On Android you can install the apk, or you can install L\u00d6VE for Android from Google Play and run the love file with it. I CAN upload Mac OS X binaries, but I don't have a Mac, so I can't test them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58af0d5ffd240719de1cabe9fa1e3113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Bahri Gordebak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
