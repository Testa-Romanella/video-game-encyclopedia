Furthermore, how well can our slime experiment handle pressure? </p>\n<p> <strong>Method</strong> = Autonomous slime must run and jump to the exit with out being exterminated by the lasers. When the slime moves, the lasers close in, which effectively reduces the play space and increases the chances of death.</p>\n<p> <strong>Results</strong> = Download OutOfSpace.zip below to view lab results.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>C:\\System\\Lab02\\Report&gt; get credits</strong></p>\n<p>Art/Animation = Adam Dao<br/></p>\n<p>Level Design = Cole Pergerson</p>\n<p>Programming = Kevin Prakash<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Design/Music Composition = Miles Caraker</p>\n<p>UI/Programming =\u00a0Jingkang Chen </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3abf40fae165633c0e51d22df2dd6349.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kprakash", "Mr. Pergerson", "trimin", "Atapari", "sniper_link"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
