Each year, for the past decade or so, I've been making a 'cover art' piece to mark the new year. For 2023 I made it using Bitsy! It's New Year's Eve in a magical forest valley. Visiting the large stars reveal fond personal memories of 2022, and visiting the moon progresses the piece towards the end. If you (sensibly) want something to do other than indulge my memories of 2022, then collect all the twinkling stars for a surprise at the end!</p>\n<p>[N.B. This piece is meant primarily as a fun creation to share with people I already know online - it will likely mean little if you've stumbled over this by accident!]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T12:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/1987b4734804435718fe0beb7683fae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["racarter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
