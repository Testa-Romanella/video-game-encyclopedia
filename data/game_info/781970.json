These initial levels will test the players foresight and ability to plan their present movement to help them solve the level, sometimes with the help of their past self. Press E to press buttons, go through time machines, and pick up boxes. Press R to restart a level, press W to jump, and get to the brown door to get through a level. Some levels include time traveling from anywhere in the map using F. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:20:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec8/ec89cc114d021b2f339a8898ca24b471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dahlgrenthomas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
