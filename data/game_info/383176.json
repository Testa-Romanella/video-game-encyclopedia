We chose for the hooking ability from roadhog in Overwatch. After some thought we've also added other hooks from Overwatch like the hook from Wrecking Ball to move with the rope.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Developer - Joey\u00a0 van der Wijk\u00a0</p><p>Developer - Coen Steuns</p><p>Artist -\u00a0GalaxyyTearss -\u00a0Twitter</p><p>Artist -\u00a0Lucas Java - Instagram</p><p>Music - JoshRPM -\u00a0Red Peaks Music</p><p><strong>Extra</strong></p><p>This is the 3rd game in the Karel Universe.</p><p>The previous 2 are back in development and can be found here:</p><p>Karel Kill The Voices<br/></p><p>Haunted Voice</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f2674b24363ca99d7c61e0773443927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jvdwijk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
