You can give a name to your game so that your friend can find your game in the list. You can also set a password for your game to block others.</p>\n<p>The rules are a bit different from the classic battleship game. Each player has three shots per turn. This makes it harder to guess the coordinates where your opponent's ships are.</p>\n<p>You can drag and drop ships into the maps from the pool beside them.\u00a0 You can also highlight a set of three shots that you fired in previous turns by clicking on a shot. These options help you while guessing where your opponent's ships are.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b696e5c5a00368300cbd143fdecfad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Musap Kahraman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
