I am a high school student and mainly use Unity as a game engine. Trying out, learning and making a game using Core - all in 1 day was fun! Most of the key controls are similar to some of Unity's, so that helped out a lot too!</p>\n<p>The theme of this game jam was <strong>\"2020 THE GAME\"</strong>. As we all know, <strong>COVID-19</strong> changed our lives, and wearing masks became essential when walking in public areas. Unfortunately, not everyone wears a mask and some even don't believe in the existence of the dangerous virus. In answer to that - I made a game where you have to survive by not colliding with other humans, or in different words - by socially distancing yourself! The end part of the game features a fight against anti-maskers, yikes! Luckily you will get a funky, yet useful weapon - the Mask Gun. Shoot masks at the faces of the anti-maskers to defend them and yourself from spreading the contageous disease!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c40d802bff014d6c3497878ef330568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Danial Jumagaliyev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
