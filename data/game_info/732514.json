It&#39;s an RPG in which you are given 1 of 18 different Stands by a mysterious benefactor known only as &quot;Steel&quot;, based on your answers to a personality quiz given at the beginning. Using this Stand, you join (or don&#39;t join) the main characters of Stardust Crusaders as they journey to Egypt in order to kill DIO and cure Holly of her Stand-induced sickness. Everything starts out as the source material does, but making the right decisions and events will diverge from it, for better or for worse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T15:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa303132a2accde6b4e665d754985e33.jpg", "website": "https://7thjojo.tumblr.com/post/98202338885/after-several-months-in-the-making-the-7th-stand", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
