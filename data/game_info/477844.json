Note it's not a very good game.,\u00a0\u00a0it is my first JAM and my second officially completed game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>||\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0THANK YOU\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0||</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:33:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61b/61b408bd9bfab5fcb3616382e9bcee1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["codingman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
