To play this video game you will just need to buy some thrust oil to race the tracks while dodging some rocks only. At your race you can change your different thrust oil speed in the end. Also this could be an offline single player video game to play with it by yourself anywhere else without any Wi-Fi. So have fun playing my endless AI video game to reach the farther mileage as you can.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you will like this game and give us some feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d9241614dde7d5184ba95b1360036918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Lightning Gravity"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
