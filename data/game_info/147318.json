Start from scratch your world.\u00a0</p><p>Create some land and help your initial villagers to survive during the first period of time.

Replenish the wood you cut down with a forester tower. Create mines, once you've run out of surface resources. FIsh with boats. And then, upgrade your houses, animal pens, and boats to make them more efficient. <br/>Have fun, and see how far you can get your village to grow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d58/d580fa0276030fd88c6272383c9baf62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sachonski"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
