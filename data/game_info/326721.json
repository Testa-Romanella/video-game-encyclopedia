With this two different ways to see the world collaboration is essential. Why? Because you cannot escape on your own. The mechanisms that open the doors don't open yours, they open your partner's doors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Night vision player:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0W: Forward | S: Backwards | A: Left | D: Right | Q: Rotate Left | E: Rotate right</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thermal vision player:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Direction arrows to move and mouse movement to look around.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creative Statement:</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This dependancy creates a collaboration dynamic that makes people want to help their partner. Helping your partner is helping yourself, which is a message that we all should consider more often.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The two types of vision, one night vision, the other thermal vision strengthens the idea of having to different visions of the world. Even if the labyrinth that each player wanders is identical to the other, it will be completely different to each one of them, because they are not seeing things the same way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The necessary collaboration united with the two types of vision creates a unique combination that will create a connection between the two players by realizing that one cannot thrive without the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Current State of Progress:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This game is currently in development.
