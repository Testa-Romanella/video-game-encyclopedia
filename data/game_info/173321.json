In Distant Memories you never forget you always remember.<br/>Distant Memories is still in Development and will be constantly updated with new builds and features.  The game is at the Pre- Alpha faze and still has many new features to be added and explored. Feel free to play and test the game and comment for ideas and glitches that you may find while playing the game.
