That said, Eldervale is much more than just paying respects to the classics: It puts it's own twist on the genre, making it more accessible to new players as well as nostalgic for veterans. I hope you will enjoy, so I can continue the hard work for a genre I love.<br/></p>\n<p>Press kit: https://eldervale.com/press-kit/</p>\n<p>Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/VryNBv5<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T07:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/84747164273030c892b933fcccfade12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solkitte"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
