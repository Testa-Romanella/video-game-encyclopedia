On your journey you will encounter many obstacles, like meteorites, dangerous satellite lasers and even UFO's. The Rungine Rocket 2000 is way to fast to be damaged directly, but every hit causes the space around you to shatter.Touching these void holes will cause you to die instantly, so be careful.</p>\n<p>Your goal is simple: Run out of space, while trying to not run out of space <br/>Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move and Space to shoot</p>\n<p>This was our first participation in a Ludum Dare Jam and it all worked quite well for the beginning. We had way more content planned like a bossfight at the end or some fancy background objects, but we really ran out of time (and space :&gt;). Anyways, we hope you have fun with our little game and maybe see you soon at another Jam. o/</p>\n<p>Credits: <br/>We took all used sounds from https://freesound.org/ and all music from Newgrounds</p>\n<p>Used music;<br/>Attack -\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/82073<br/>Space Jungle -\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/82073<br/>Void -\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/606202<br/>Space -\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/707567</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/129/12944e3270216ff1dca20881c2017f43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kromzem"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
