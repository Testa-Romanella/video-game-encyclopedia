You were cooking your stew, when your wizard cousin, Clowny, decided to bring your vegetables to\u00a0life! Now you have to use your cook-arsenal to hunt them, in order to finish cooking your delicious and (arguabily) cruelty-free stew! (yum)</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 6 Mechanics Jam. It was a one-week jam, but we joined like 3 days before the deadline, so we did what we could in this last 3 days or so. Restriction was \"Lose to Win\", so we thought of \"losing your equipment in order to progress on the game\", and\u00a0that's why you gotta throw one of your items at the end of each level lol<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0sailorastronarts for the beautiful art!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I want to credit\u00a0LuKremBo\u00a0for the song I\u00a0used for the game. You can listen to it here!<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you like it! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T07:40:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bdc2b1f8004e6b650b11611f7b33ee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Enio Lotero", "Ana"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
