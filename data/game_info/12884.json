{"id": 12884, "slug": "helldivers", "name": "HELLDIVERS", "name_original": "HELLDIVERS", "description": "<p>HELLDIVERS is a top-down shooter where you need to complete procedurally generated missions among the endless amount of enemies. While the game has a single-player mode, the gameplay is more suitable for a co-op playthrough. Unlike in many shooters, in HELLDIVERS you must avoid friendly fire as you can hurt your teammates. Another feature is that you can decide for yourself where to drop, which vehicles to use and choose the order of the objectives to complete.<br />\nThe story is set on Super Earth where the government brainwashes people to make them more loyal. While the planet is surrounded by enemy creatures that intend to destroy it, you play as a soldier of a HELLDIVERS unite who needs to protect Super Earth. As a rule, the missions include forcing through an enemy base, capturing required objectives and escape. There&#39;s no need to kill all the enemies as they are endless; instead, you can try to complete the mission stealthier. Before the mission, you can choose weapons from a variety of equipment and also get support firepower during the battle.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ae3/ae357d6e6f9e89597e8293469ddabba9.jpg", "website": "http://arrowheadgamestudios.com/games/helldivers/", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 109, "owned": 2676, "beaten": 128, "toplay": 50, "dropped": 322, "playing": 25}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 399, "ratings_count": 551, "suggestions_count": 524, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 552, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Arrowhead Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["PlayStation Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
