{"id": 701608, "slug": "attack-of-the-red-balls", "name": "Attack of the Red Balls", "name_original": "Attack of the Red Balls", "description": "<p>In this game, you play as a green ball that got lost in a mysterious dungeon and has to get out. To complete a level, you need to exit through the gap on the bottom. If you hit a blue ball, you earn 1 or 2 points (usually 2). If you hit a red ball, you die. Good luck! The game consists of 9 levels and passing all of them will give you some bragging rights. The first level is easy, but the number of red balls and walls grows each level, but more importantly, the balls start moving faster so you have to think faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/5450a2055cee424012e92c3c22a8793e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bloody Wall Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
