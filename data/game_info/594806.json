There's a treasure at the bottom of these seas and you're gonna be the one to get it! Bring some treasures with you to upgrade your hook! Then go Deeper and Deeper until the end!</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the sunken treasure at the bottom of the sea. In order to do so, you must navigate down to the bottom without filling up your hook's capacity. You will grab anything you touch on the way down. Once the hook is full, you start going back up! On the way up, anything you run into will knock something off your hook! Whatever makes it with you to the top will be sold. Use the money to buy upgrades and go Reel Deep!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to navigate menus</li><li>Arrows to move</li><li>C to use repellent (must unlock first)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Your total money earned is saved, but not your purchased upgrades.
