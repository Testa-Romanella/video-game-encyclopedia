By collecting coins spread throughout the map, you earn points, which shows how much of the map you have explored. By going to the small island, which can be seen right at the start but is difficult to access, you can end the round. At the start, if you head North, you will go through a series of mazes with lots of money to collect, however, you will not be able to access the island. If you go Southward instead, you will reach a maze that takes you to the bridge that goes to the island, but will not find any coins. The optimal strategy would be to go North first and then South. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T18:31:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb0542d85b363d3fedcc821b8bdc2caf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["falconXYZ"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
