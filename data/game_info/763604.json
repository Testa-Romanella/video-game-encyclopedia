Unfortunately for you, Dimitry is a dick so he keeps moving the walls. What's worse is that he keeps spawning the square's mortal enemy - triangles!\u00a0Can you JUMP DIMITRY'S WALLS!?!</p>\n\n<p>This is a short game to get the idea \"Geometry Wars but a platformer\" out of my head. Collect squares to get points and avoid the triangles to survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It started out life as part of a series of coding demonstrations for the games programming module I run at Swansea University. Download it, have a play and hopefully have fun :D</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoy this please check our other games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T00:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96e/96e76561e9d8e3e28a5dec6f0d933354.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Pill Bug Interactive"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
