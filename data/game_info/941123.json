Through the medium of video game design, I hope to create an immersive and empathetic experience that allows players to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by those affected by Alzheimer's.\r\n</p>\n<p>The story follows the life of my grandmother Beverly Hurley, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's several years ago. Players will walk through a world that displays the struggles of Beverly's changing memory while her daughter, Lori Birkland, discusses her mother\u2019s disease. As the audience navigates a series of interactive scenes that represent the\u00a0 past, present and future of Beverly\u2019s disease , they will see the personal images and experience the difficulty and sadness that comes with the progression of the disease.\r\n</p>\n<p>My goal in creating \"Remembering Beverly\" is ultimately to tell my grandmother\u2019s story by using the power of video games. While also raising awareness of Alzheimer's disease and the impact it has on\u00a0 those inflicted with the disease and their families. I also hope to create a sense of community among players, encouraging them to share their own experiences and perspectives on Alzheimer's and related topics.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>By immersing players in the story of Beverly's journey with Alzheimer's, I hope to promote greater understanding, compassion, and empathy for those affected by the disease, while also showcasing the potential of video games as a powerful medium for storytelling and education.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T14:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd46be9913e1061f050fbdf1072d6480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gbirky13"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
