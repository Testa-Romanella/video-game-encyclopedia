{"id": 29285, "slug": "unreal-estate", "name": "Unreal Estate", "name_original": "Unreal Estate", "description": "In Unreal Estate, the City Council has hired you to build the best cityscape, which you\u2019ll do by drafting buildings to your hand. Rejected designs go to the Scrap Pile, but as demand for those buildings grows, you can reclaim them to score the most points. But be careful that the other architects don\u2019t score them before you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo the point to the game is simple, you collect cards based on the point value on the card, and when you have cards that match some of the cards in the scrap pile, you can score.  The scrap pile cards act as multipliers so the more of them that are there, the better.  We add in 9 different special cards but only a few at a time, so each game plays a little bit different.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay this game against AI in 2, 3, or 4 player action, or play our cross platform multi player games against random people.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you like the digital version there is also a physical version of this board game out there in the real world too.
