But be careful, The creatures of the mania dimension won\u2019t make it easy! You\u2019ll have to camp out surviving the elements and research the behaviour of your enemies to gain the most effective strategies!\u00a0<br/>The Twigin are there to help you out any day, but are you fit to lead the way?</p>\n<p>On your first play through of an area it may be burning hot but the next time it\u2019s flooded! You may find different enemies that spawn overtime, and even treasures that weren\u2019t there before!</p>\n<p>This is only an early Alpha, with only one area. Models, Areas, Gameplay, UI, Music, Sound, almost everything will change in the final game. There will be more areas with new themes, enemies, and more.
