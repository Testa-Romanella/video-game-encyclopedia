It's a prototype of an idea i been working on. Made with the Unreal engine.<br/><br/>The game will be a \"how long can you last?\", wave style type of game.<br/><br/>You will have to protect your shelter and yourself.\u00a0 The shelter is at the top of the map.<br/></p>\n<p>Use weapons to attack the zombies.<br/><br/>Ultimate goal will be to release it on mobile as thats what i'm making it for. So the layout isn't perfect for playing on the PC. But, it gets the job done.</p><p>The EXE version should look and play better.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:<br/></em></strong>WSAD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse click\u00a0 - on / in front of the zombies to attack</p>\n<p><em><strong>Final thoughts:\u00a0</strong> </em>There are bugs, the game uses a fixed birds-eye view. All assets, beside the zombie and animations was done by me. Not all assets are final, some are used for just placeholders to help get my idea out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a93/a93d6117c3d5ceb2d6b2bec4b187d7d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["nitrofreak06"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
