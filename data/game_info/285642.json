A few of them had special \u201cimport\u201d sections that gave a sneak peek into Japan games that would never make their way to the states, and one of them was the Ore no Ryouri demo, which turned your analog sticks into chef hands of fury.</p>\n<p>I was addicted to the crazy pace of the game, even though it was entirely in Japanese and I couldn\u2019t make out any of the menus. But it was a game I had never played before, and after searching the internet found that there wasn\u2019t really anything like it either. So, I made a fan game using the original sprites of ONR, where you must buy foods for your restaurant and serve them to customers perfectly before they left angrily.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-19T13:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f49/f494045be9943647e3988cfcd5183bd3.jpg", "website": "http://www.vertigogaming.net/main/freeware/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
