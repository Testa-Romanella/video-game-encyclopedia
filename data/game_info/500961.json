You must use the satellites to destroy the meteors (each satellite can take 2 hits) and collect satellite parts to build more satellites. If all your satellites are destroyed or the planet is hit by 2 meteors, you will lose. The shower will last roughly 60 seconds, can you survive?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Move clockwise: <strong>Right Arrow</strong><br/>Move counter clockwise: <strong>Left Arrow</strong><br/>Move away from planet: <strong>Up Arrow</strong><br/>Move closer to planet: <strong>Down Arrow</strong><br/>Make Selection: <strong>Space or Enter</strong><br/>Full Screen:<strong> F</strong><br/>Mute: <strong>M</strong><br/>Return to Menu: <strong>Q</strong><br/><br/>*You must return to the planet and have enough satellite parts for new ones to spawn.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef05d8452e4311b20e11f411523ce44d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vimlark"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
