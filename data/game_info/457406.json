This game was originally made for an assignment, and I have made a few small changes to it to make it compile as a .jar file, but it's pretty much exactly in the state it was in when I handed it in.</p>\n<p>Yep, it's open-source as well, and the source code is here: https://github.com/11BelowStudio/UntitledVoltorbFlipClone<br/><br/><strong>What you will need\r\n<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>A half-decent\u00a0computer</li><li>A monitor (optional, but high recommended)</li><li>A mouse (you need to be able to move it and left-click at very least,<br/>but right-clicking would be nice too)</li><li>Java (this runs on Java 8)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The objective:<ul><li>Reveal all of the '2' and '3' cards on the board. \r\n<ul><li>Your score will be multiplied by the value of the card you reveal</li></ul><ul><li>You don't need to reveal the '1' cards, but you can reveal them if you want to</li></ul></li><li>Avoid revealing any bomb cards.<ul><li>They will explode in your face, your score will go down to 0, and you will look very silly when that happens.</li></ul></li><li>Get a high score or something I guess\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Things that may help you to not lose:<ul><li>Every row/column has a panel with information about what is in the row.<ul><li>It shows the sum of the values of the point cards in that row/column,    as well as the count of bombs in that row/column.</li></ul></li><li>Right-clicking the squares for the checkerboard pattern on each card<br/>will allow you to take a note of what you think each card holds.<ul><li>You can have multiple notes on a single card</li><li>Where to click for each note<ul><li>Top-left: bomb</li><li>Top-right: 1</li><li>Bottom-left: 2</li><li>Bottom-right: 3</li></ul></li><li>Right-clicking that square again will hide that note again.</li></ul></li><li>Revealing a card will multiply your current score by the amount on that card<ul><li>However, a bomb card counts as a 'x0' multiplier for your score, and will end the game</li></ul></li><li>After you have completed a level, you will have the option to 'bank' your score.<ul><li>If you choose to 'bank' it, your current score will be added to your 'banked' score,    and your current score will be reset to 0. </li><li>However, only your 'banked' score counts towards your final score when you lose the game,    so you should bear that in mind if you're going for a high score.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Super Helpful Informative Tips<ul><li>If a row/column has 0 bombs in it, it is safe to reveal all the cards in that row/column</li><li>If a row/column has 5 bombs in it (somehow), don't bother touching it.</li><li>If the sum of the points and the bombs in a row/column is equal to 5, all the point cards in that row/column will be 1s.<ul><li>This means that you don't really need to reveal anything in that column,    as it'll either be useless (a 1) or a bomb (which is also useless)</li><li>Same principle applies if the row/column has Y unrevealed cards,    and the sum of the total score for the row/column (minus the revealed score)    plus bombs is equal to Y</li></ul></li><li>Yes, you will sometimes need to make lucky guesses.</li><li>Bank your points if you don't think you'll survive the next level.<ul><li>After all, you'll lose eventually, and you don't want all your hard work to go to waste (probably)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming, Art, etc:<ul><li>11BelowStudio</li><li>Code used to get the image into the .JAR file provided by JB Nizet on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/a/8362018)</li></ul></li><li>Original game concept<ul><li>This game is essentially a recreation of the 'Voltorb Flip' minigame    from the non-Japanese versions of Pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver    (developed by Game Freak, published by Nintendo, 2010).
