It's called <strong><em>\"Super Gala\u00a0Omega\"</em></strong>. I created this in<strong> GameMaker: Studio 1.4</strong></p>\n<p>If you're wondering why I named that, the reason is simple : It's because of a game that the character (<strong>Chiaki Nanami</strong> from <strong>Danganronpa 2</strong>) is playing.\u00a0Also the ship in the game is inspired by the hairpin that <strong>Chiaki Nanami</strong> have.</p>\n<p>I should mention that the game took me around a month to develop (because I'm just a beginner at developing and learn how to program took me around a year and a half.)</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p><em><strong>Instructions (How to play) :</strong></em></p>\n<p>- Simply move your mouse to control the ship.</p>\n<p>-----------</p>\n<p>And that's it for now, I hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I enjoy making it\u00a0and I really can't wait to release my next game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2de3d1b04ace8344b2cdc41a50f3ac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seireiart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
