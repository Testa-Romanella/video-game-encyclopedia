The game has been tried and it works correctly with\u00a0<em>\"VICE - the Versatile Commodore Emulator\" ver. 3.5</em>. You can download it for free by\u00a0clicking here.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Once the emulator software has been installed, follow the instructions below:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>start\u00a0x64sc.exe\u00a0program;\r\n  </li><li>click on\u00a0File\u00a0&gt;\u00a0Attach disk image\u00a0&gt;\u00a0Drive 8;\r\n  </li><li>select\u00a0evolution10.d64\u00a0file (click here to download);\r\n  </li><li>click on\u00a0Attach;\r\n  </li><li>type\u00a0LOAD \"EVOLUTION10\",8,1;\r\n  </li><li>when finished loading, type\u00a0RUN\r\n  </li></ul>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>The game is turn-based. At the beginning of each round it is shown which individual (phenotype) is to be obtained from the genetic combination, and the available individuals are shown:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The player must indicate the pair of individuals that they want to \"mix\" to obtain two more. The player must choose two (different) numbers in the 1..4 interval. The player's choice should be such as to reward those individuals who individually, or combined, most closely resemble the target individual. The program therefore performs both genetic blending and phenotypic regeneration.\u00a0For a more extensive explanation we recommend to read\u00a0this article.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The game repeats itself from generation to generation, until the player gets the wanted individual.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The greater the number of generations, the worse the result the player has achieved.\r\n</p>\n\r\nSOURCE CODE (EXPLAINED)\r\n<p>Below you will find the source code of the video game. The source code has been written extensively (without abbreviations), in order to make it easier to understand. Each line has been commented to illustrate how the code works.\r\n  </p>\r\nINITIALIZATION (LINE 1)\r\n<p>0 x=53280:pokex,0:pokex+1,0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Now we set the background and border color of the screen (here for a complete map). The best is to use the black color (0) for both. This is \"classic\" color of my games.\r\n  </p>\n<p>x=rnd(-TI*peek(x-14))\r\n  </p>\n<p>We carry out a first and deep initialization of the random number generator. This form of initialization is necessary because the game relies heavily on a random component and, in the absence of this formulation, the game is likely to be repetitive with the use of emulators. So, in addition to using the internal clock (TI) we will also use the least significant byte of the electron beam position.\r\n  </p>\n<p>print\"{clear}{down}{down}{down}{down}{red}e{green}v{yellow}o{blue}l{red}u{green}t{yellow}i{blue}o{red}n {white}10\";\r\n  </p>\n<p>We print the game title.\r\n  </p>\n<p>e=5\r\n  </p>\n<p>We use this variable to maintain the number of individuals present for each generation. Individuals are made up of the four presented to the player, and which vary, plus a fifth representing the goal to be achieved.\r\n  </p>\n<p>g=5\r\n  </p>\n<p>Instead, this variable contains the number of genes that make up the genome of each individual. Each gene encodes a different aspect, and it takes 5 to draw an individual.\r\n  </p>\n<p>n$=\"1234t\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>This variable contains the title (label) of each individual. We use this technique instead of printing a number as in BASIC V2 it is not possible to print a number without having it followed by a space, which is not aesthetically acceptable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>h$=\"{red}{green}{yellow}{blue}\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is the set of colors encoded by gene 1.\r\n  </p>\n<p>t$=\"{171}{166}{113}#\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is the set of tails encoded by gene 5.\r\n  </p>\n<p>b$=\"{99}{219}{178}{177}\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is the set of intermediate elements of the body, including those encoded by genes 3 and 4.\r\n  </p>\n<p>1 print\r\n  </p>\n<p>We print an empty line (<em>empty lines are interleaved with the logic for a matter of occupation and respect for the length of the BASIC lines</em>).\r\n  </p>\n<p>rk=1\r\n  </p>\n<p>We initialize the number of the gene that will undergo a random mutation.
