You can customize your character and show up in unique looks.</p>\n<p>THE MAIN MOTIVE OF THIS GAME IS TO STAY ON GROUND. This means that you need to AVOID falling/disappearing ground at all cost to avoid falling off and LOOSING. Also, WATCH OUT FOR OTHER PLAYERS. They can push you off to eliminate you. As tensed as it may sound, LandStrug is a fun game with funny character looks, animations and voices. In the multiplayer mode, you can express your feeling to everyone during gameplay.\u00a0 In the training section, you play alone with the motive to become better at the game. In the multiplayer section, after connecting to the server, you get introduced to the lobby, where you can either create a room for others to join, or join a room already created.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T15:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/683/683c61e73802ae263ba321ffa702d645.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameScar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
