The ultimate roguelike experience, I guess</p>\n<p><strong>Slice and Dice</strong> is a short dice-based roguelike game loosely set in Victorian London.\u00a0This is a\u00a0\u00a0submission for a BGDJam 2022. This game is made in 3 days or so.</p>\n\n<p>You are Sir Fancypants, a fine gentleman who decides to wake up one day and choose violence. Slice and dice your way to victory throughout many stages, which most of them probably\u00a0is about murdering\u00a0a couple of strangers. Along the way, you may encounter some crates lying around the street\u00a0(with weapons in it, how convenient!), your old pal Greg trying to upsell you one of his weird inventions, and a few good tea drinking spot, I guess.</p>\n<p>Can you prevail? Or will you suffer the pain of not being alive?</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n\n<ul><li>This is a turn-based game. Try to defeat your enemy before he does it first</li><li>On your turn, you can use your 3 items, each can be activated by dragging one of your dice onto your desired items.</li><li>Each item have different properties. For example, using a Derringer will deal N+2 damage to enemy, where 'N' is your dice value.</li><li>After you end your turn, the enemy will attack you. Then rinse and repeat until one of you ceases to exist, so try to use your item strategically if you want to progress.</li><li>After each combat, you can choose the path you want to go.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Plan your course strategically! Exchange and/or upgrade\u00a0your current equipment by visiting a <strong>shop</strong>; Gain one free equipment by visiting a <strong>crate</strong>; and restore some health by visiting a <strong>rest point</strong>.</li><li>That's it, I guess. Good luck!</li></ul>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\nTeam Open Source 100:\r\n<p><strong>----- Programmer -----</strong></p>\n<p>Ali Jaya Meilio Lie<br/>alijaya - itch.io<br/><br/>Kuuki Kei<br/>teamgehu - itch.io<br/><br/><strong>----- Artist, Asset Thief\u00a0-----</strong></p>\n<p>muhamadmentari<br/>MuhamadMentari - itch.io</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets, Stolen --------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Click SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Ranner/sounds/488534/<br/><br/>Dice Roll SFX<br/>Freesound - \"dice_06.wav\" by dermotte<br/></p>\n<p>Punch\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/JohnLoser/sounds/573376/</p>\n<p>Tea Sip\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/odditonic/sounds/194808/</p>\n<p>Recover Health\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/403018/</p>\n<p>Loot\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/444491/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/kevinkace/sounds/66778/</p>\n<p>Shop\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Volvion/sounds/609788/</p>\n<p>Win\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/joepayne/sounds/413203/</p>\n<p>Lose\u00a0SFX<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Harbour11/sounds/194624/<br/></p>\n<p>Background Image<br/>https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/urban-street-landscape-with-small-shop-restaurant_7101586.htm#query=victorian%20city&amp;position=0&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph</p>\n<p><strong>\"The Cannery\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\"One-eyed Maestro\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T08:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/2401fa1e456a28978a58e32c0b5c357b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teamgehu", "MuhamadMentari", "alijaya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
