Bullets will splat the paint on impact. Goo: you shoot goo and it will act like a bullet if you press shoot goo again it will stick in that place, if a paint blob hits it the paint will splat, if you shoot a paint blob with another goo it will go towards the first. Jet-pack allows you to fly.</p>\n<p>This is the third game I have made and the second that was supervised by Najam Haq. In this game you play as a painter trapped in a painting trying to get out.</p>\n<p>Note I made this a while ago.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f6dcd4c346ec71cd3a7055a9bb71559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MicDoes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
