Each turn a new '2' or '4' stone will appear on the 4x4 grid, meaning that you'll have to choose your moves carefully. Every time you collide two or more tiles, your score increases by their merged value.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOriginally an entrant in RGCD's 2014 C64 16KB Cartridge Competition, this final commercial version of the game features further visual improvements and minor bug-fixes (such as same speed music played on PAL and NTSC systems).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C-2048</strong> features:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Addictive puzzle action!</em></li>\n<li><em>Beautiful graphics and hires typography!</em></li>\n<li><em>An awesome SID soundtrack!</em></li>\n<li><em>Soft shift technology!</em></li>\n<li><em>Full PAL &amp; NTSC compatibility!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>For further information on the game, please check the press kit.<br/>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Playing C-2048 on Windows, Mac or Linux</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tPlease note that the downloadable Commodore 64 version available here is primarily for use with emulators, but can also be run on a real C64 via hardware such as the 1541 Ultimate II or Turbo Chameleon. For emulator users, we recommend VICE, as it works on a variety of operating systems and is very user friendly. In fact, we've even included a pre-configured Windows, Mac and Linux version of the emulator with the download as well as some simple user instructions (we're nice like that).\r\n\t</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Buy C-2048 on Cartridge for your Commodore 64 Computer!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tEnjoyed <strong>C-2048 </strong>on your modern-day PC?
