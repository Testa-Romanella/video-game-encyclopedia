To play, you'll have to buy an episode.</strong><br/><br/>Butterflies is a video game about inline skating and graffiti.<br/><br/>Apparently some people did that before, but they don't seem like they'll be doing it anymore.<br/><br/>So, here are some skates and some cans, and some adrenaline-pumping tunes to hype you up for the ride. You'll be dodging your way through taser cameras, angry cops and much more. Go paint. Or don't. Be free. Be everywhere and nowhere. Run. Jump.
