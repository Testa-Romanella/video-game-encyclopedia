I used many of the skills I learned from my first short 2D platformer level to build more fleshed-out movement and mechanics.\u00a0I'm proud\u00a0of the enemy ship's movements and the reverse gravity ability the player has.\u00a0The backgrounds and colors do not always match but I'm pretty happy with the game itself. The game is so short because it was made for my first ever game jam.</p><p>If you have any feedback, especially on controls (since I\u00a0don't play a lot of PC games) or bugs please comment and let me know.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>https://chimplement.itch.io/crater-caverns</p>\n<p>https://fungifurball.itch.io/space-assets</p>\n<p>https://hexadecimalwtf.itch.io/space-pixels</p>\n<p>https://axassets.itch.io/spaceship-simple-assets</p>\n<p>https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/space</p>\n<p>https://chiphead64.itch.io/dreamy-space-soundtrack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b85d4ae80a72e7220927df16d07dfb56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TimProffitt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
