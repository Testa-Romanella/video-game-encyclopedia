In it we will advance through a dystopian world full of action and places to explore.</p>\n<p>The moments of exploration are one of the most important parts of the game, since we will use them to collect resources, complete certain puzzles that we will find along the journey and discover more about the world around us.</p>\n<p>In this way the history of this world is not told to us by a narrator, we discover it as players by finding clues, memories and interacting with other characters as we play.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0The game is set in the year 2000, in Rivenham, an ancient valley teeming with life with a central town. A large corporation called HEL Science has appeared and is taking control of the valley thanks to its great technological discoveries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has developed robots with highly advanced AI and thanks to them he has taken control of the city by threatening and extorting people. People who can't pay the amount HEL asks for are taken to Steelgate. Steelgate is the entrance to HEL\u2019s prison, once you cross it you will spend the rest of your days working for HEL.\r\n The people who fled the city and refused to live under the threat of HEL are The Explorers.\r\n They are dedicated to surviving and fighting the robots on the outskirts of the valley.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our protagonist, Seth, and his sister, Lilith, belong to a group of explorers. Seth is in fact the leader, and one day during an exploration for resources Lilith disappeared. They tried to look for her but after following her trail they discover that Lilith was kidnapped by HEL and she is in Steelgate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0The objective of the game is to get Lilith out of Steelgate by fighting against HEL and overcoming different challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In this small demo, the combat is not yet implemented, so the objective is to open the door that blocks the way to the city.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement \u2013 WASD</p>\n<p>Jump \u2013 SPACE</p>\n<p>Crouch \u2013 CTRL</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n<p>Pause - P</p>\n<p>Made in Unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>Artstation:\u00a0artstation.com/manuelortega</p>\n<p>Gmail: manuelortegavico@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f9fa322f095a7b8e9757dbf8d2c188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Manuel Ortega"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
