The whole thing came together in about a week and we are incredibly proud of what we made.</p>\n<p>Based on the randomly-generated theme \"highway, secrets, home\" we decided to make a game similar to Pokemon Snap where the player takes pictures of the strange creatures they see after taking a wrong turn going home. Players can view up to 8 photos they took along the ride when they finish the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a8b998250011ad5bce270a6de53201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cynicaesura"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
