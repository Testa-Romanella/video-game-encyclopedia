These same diverse strategies help when facing bosses which can modify the battle field to provide extreme elemental advantage in their favor so be careful not to forego the leveling aspect of the game!<br/><br/>PSI Magic also caters to those who simply wish to explore the game world by having hidden maps, bosses, collectibles, treasure and a mercenary system. If the player achieves certain criteria, they may even discover a hidden after boss beyond the final boss of the game!<br/><br/>Custom music tracks have been created to provide a novel experience along your journey throughout the game world in addition to the creation and use of custom assets to alleviate some of the eye sore that comes from over use of the base assets that come with the game engine.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the esper pair, Abell and Ceres, who, after a confrontation with a mysterious group, ended up in another world. In this world, the pair are joined by two others who then go on to face off against this group and put a stop to its grand-fully reckless scheme!<br/><br/>Gameplay Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZZLGnnV-AA", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5f8ffb4be92f5e17ea5cca0150e7693.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyle"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kyle"], "esrb_rating": null}
