The theme of the game jam was a misc collection of futuristic pictures or pictures of barren wastelands, so I went with a generic choice of post apocalyptic war against the machines.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is the survive against the machine threat and gather supplies to prepare for eliminating the larger machine enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0All programming, music, models and textures are made by me. (Except for the fire texture). Some sound effects and quality of life improvements were made after the game jam event.</p><p>Playtime is probably somewhere around 15 mins.</p>\n<p>Controller support for XBOX360, XBOX ONE, PS4 and PS3 controllers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:58:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d3ed61453f1e5d7fcfbecb90dfa2ef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spoland"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
