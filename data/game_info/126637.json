Wait, no... it's actually just a game about saving as much shitfiles from your computer before a virus takes over.</p>\n<p>To do so, you must carefully manage your files to make sure you use the limited space across your 10MB hard drive and your shitty floppy disks, without RUNNING OUT OF SPACE!!!!!!!!!! Take some time to browse through the files, after some time, a virus will start propagating in your PC and lead to the end of the game.</p>\n<p>The game is really hard to finish as such, and you will most definitely fail. But you will sure get a good laugh from it browsing through the numerous files.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:<br/>While all models and UI elements and most of the content in the files (including texts, sounds and videos) found in the game were created during the jam, several assets were taken from the internet and passed through filters and various effects. As it were part of the game's theme, we don't know if it makes it uneligible for the graphics category.</p>\n<p>TEAM:</p>\n<p>Samuel Bourassa <br/>Guillaume Duquesne <br/>Swann Klein <br/>Alexandre Pernot Lopes <br/>John Henry Rumsby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b8c33bfa3f845b593dc95adbe715e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pinataMAN", "Dukes", "Alexandre Pernot Lopes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
