You don\u2019t remember what you are doing there but the environment is bright and rather unfriendly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are a tiny bee in a giant environment and move continuously forward. You are free to fly wherever you want and explore the level to your heart\u2019s desire. <br/>\r\nAfter you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets and find a couple of different items. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor once there are energy potions which fill your energy meter to continuously fly faster until you run out of energy. <br/>\r\nSecondly there are golden flowers hidden everywhere in the levels that you can collect as a reward for exploring even the more hidden parts of the levels \u2013 collecting all of them unlocks an extra achievement in each level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLast but not least there are the bright shining knowledge shards that show you the way into the next area. Whenever you collect one the next one will spawn ahead of you and show you the right way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you have found a certain amount of knowledge shards you will be able to enter the next area and the story continues. Each area is another part of a world that a bee could experience and a little step further to find a new home.  Therefore, each level has a different color theme, general setting, mood and story. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the beginning of each area is a short break in which in which a part of poem is read to you. The poem talks about the bee and it\u2019s journey to find a new home and explains a little bit about the level that lies ahead.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T03:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981ada7ab285bee26e8845b12a7cfb80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
