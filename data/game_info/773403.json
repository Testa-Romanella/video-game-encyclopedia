There are no branching triggers or narrative yet either. This prototype consists of the basic functionality of the game. The character is currently a placeholder and the graphics are not final.</p>\n<p>Use mouse to click in the game. No other controls needed.</p>\n<p>This prototype was made as part of Centria Game Lab of Spring 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/336e30dbb15f34828d6bda378646d0f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jokatti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
