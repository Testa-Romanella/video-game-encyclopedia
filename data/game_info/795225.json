A bunch of little stick figures dancing around. Using the tools at your disposal (music, lights, glowsticks, boosts, glitter, etc), make sure that the little stick figures have the most epic time possible at the club.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Get them together, in pairs and in groups. Get them to dance in sync to the music and the lights. Use dance circles to levitate people. Euphoria. Ecstasy. See visions of light and wonder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0At the end of the day, it\u2019s not about competition or win/lose, but rather getting all the little stick figures to have the best time possible.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Everyone. Rocks.
