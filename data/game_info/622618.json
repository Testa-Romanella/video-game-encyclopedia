Action, space, and plot are designed entirely by original 3D sound algorithms. You explore a mysterious world that constantly surprises you with scenes painted by sounds and music. The gameplay  is similar to video games, but enriched with a total sensory immersion and lots of work left for the imagination that is stimulated by the amazing ability humans have to \u201esee through sounds\u201d.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Fate is also a story stretched in three time dimensions (or rather two time dimensions and one place beyond time and space) that touches the deepest human questions about life and death. True sounds of the Universe were used to create original ambients and sounds effects.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Under the facade of a happy woman, there are unexplainable anxieties and longings. There is one remnant of unknown past from before she had been adopted, a totem of identity. Black and white picture of a group of people who seem\u2026 fearful? They stand in front of a monumental, red brick building. What are they afraid of? Who are they? And where? Thomas knows he must aid his beloved in the search for her roots. With the help of his friends from a history forum, he finds a lead! The building is the former Owi\u0144ska mental hospital in Poland, from just before WW II began. And one of the ladies in the picture is\u2026 Her great-grandmother?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, Thomas and Mary come to Poland, only to find another photography in an old Cistercian convent library. It\u2019s exactly the same as Mary\u2019s\u2026 Or is it? No, hold on, it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s this one little girl next to great-grandma. But before they have time to think, find any meaningful answers, there comes\u2026 Oh, we can\u2019t explain this, you have to hear it yourself! Because this is where everything gets complicated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thomas tries to find himself in these new circumstances. He wanders about in a labyrinth of corridors, sometimes thinking he still is in the present, and only hearing strange revenants. Sometimes realizing he\u2019s now in a completely different place and maybe even time. He hears screams in German, gun shots, crying\u2026 Now \u2013 or once upon a time \u2013 he will meet an extremely important little girl. Oh, and also there\u2019s Blinky, a cat that seems simultaneously dead and alive \u2013 what a paradox\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T03:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13bb2e6e834a24fc14682c016ca9d755.jpg", "website": "https://rosemarysfate.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game The Same"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Game The Same"], "esrb_rating": null}
