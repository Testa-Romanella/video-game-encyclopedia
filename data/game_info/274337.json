So you have to **sacrifice** some of your souls to upgrade your weapon.</p>\n<p>Upgrading the weapon will make it stronger, increase hit range, and attack faster.</p>\n<p>The souls are blue orbs hovering around. Attack the souls to harvest them.</p>\n<p>Oh almost forgot, look out for Soul Guardians they will hunt you and take back the souls you harvest. If they take away too many souls, well you're dead... again, I suppose :-P A reaper is undead right?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>WASD = Move<br/>Left mouse button = Attack<br/>E = Interact<br/>Z = Skip wave timer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d09646727b039ca852989e15f807bd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DeepWolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
