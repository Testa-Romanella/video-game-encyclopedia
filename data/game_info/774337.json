(https://gm48.net/game/2039/dodger-swirl)<br/></p>\n<p>The theme reminded me of a game I've been working on, called Dodger,  in which you play as a little bandana-clad fella whirling through  portals and dodging bullets fired by a big floating eye. I came up with  the idea in the first place because I wanted to make an action-y game  that's focused solely on evasion as opposed to combat back.\r\n </p>\n<p>So,  here I decided to make a spin-off of that game! Dodger: Swirl features  the same bandana-boy swirling through an endless whirlwind of portals,  dodging bullets and collecting enough points to move on to the next  level</p>\n<p>I also figured that this would be a good chance to practice using the GameMaker web export! Due to an issue with the save/load system, I was not able to submit that in time for the jam, but now that I've fixed it (and learned a lot in the process!) you can play it right here in your browser!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Follow me at https://twitter.com/illdie314 to catch when Dodger gets released too! <br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS<br/></p>\r\nSpaceStartLeft/RightMove left/right<br/>UpMove forward<br/>\n<p>Includes the font \"Diary of an 8-bit mage\" by Chequered Ink (https://www.fontspace.com/diary-of-an-8-bit-mage-font-f28455)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T21:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07aaec82759e53eab82acc17ba9663d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["illdie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
