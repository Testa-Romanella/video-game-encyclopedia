You play as a plant-human hybrid that is lost deep within an abandoned and overgrown lab facility.</p>\n<p>Control the vines and solve puzzles by making bridges, moving objects and swinging your way forward.</p>\n<p>The vines are what binds everything together, but beware, as something sinister might also lurk somewhere in the depths of the facility.</p>\n<p>Symbiosis was made by ten students as a vertical slice during a four week project at FutureGames in Stockholm, Sweden (although some modifications have been made since then)</p>\n<p>The game is recommended to play with an xbox-controller or similar, but we have now also added mouse and keyboard support.
