Quiet.\r\n<p><em>Your torch continues slowly burning your hand as the flame eats the tar-soaked branch. You are this years designated Crawler. You've passed through the opening into 'The Dark' some odd hours ago- or at least it feels so. Time is irrelevant down here, the passing of such only documented by your shrinking torchlight.</em></p>\n<p><em>You trip, stumble, and almost drop your ceremonial mallet. Illuminating the hazard that nearly rendered you unconscious marks a worrying discovery - last years crawler, still face down in the stone. He appears calm, asleep almost; if it weren't for the extreme malnourishment on his face.</em></p>\n<p><em>You clench your mallet. You're not ending up like him.</em></p>\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\n<p>Hey guys! This was my\u00a0entry to Ludum Dare 52 -\u00a0Harvest Jam. I\u00a0made this prototype game in under 48 hours in one weekend, coding most of the code/art/models/UI from scratch! Obviously the game\u00a0 is a little rough and there are a bunch of things I'd like to change; one of which is making it easier as it's actually quite difficult to nab the smaller bugs!</p>\n<p>Anyway, give it a try and let me know if you find any bugs. The coding/mechanics\u00a0kind. heh.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button: Capture Net</li><li>Right Mouse Button: Mallet</li><li>WASD: Movement\r\n</li><li>Space: Jump\r\n</li><li>Left Ctrl: Slide</li><li>Movement + Wall: Wall Slide/Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T13:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdc7534d505ba4a7913a9fa6f93718ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["True_Beef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
