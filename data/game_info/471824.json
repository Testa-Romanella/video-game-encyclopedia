Details like your egg's accessories and movement patterns can help distinguish them from the others, but beware: your fellow eggs don't like to be pushed around, and the crowd is a very difficult obstacle to cross. It's like a scavenger hunt, but with several more unbearable egg puns and significantly more stressful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eggmageddon was made in 48 hours by Trisagion Games, for GMTK Jam 2020!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>That's about it! Good luck trying to find out which egg you are :)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Ben Cuan - Code, Sound, Music</li><li>Kevin Chu - Graphic Design, Art</li><li>Omar Hossain - Code</li><li>Eric Qian - Code</li><li>Akhilan Ganesh - Code</li><li>Kapilan Ganesh - Code, Playtesting</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea0d4365a8c1ff8a07a1d15b2e6e027c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Epicrider"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
