You can't fight back, so being caught means game over.</p>\n<p>As you expand your sight range, enemies in that range will be alerted to your presence in two stages, the second of which will cause them to investigate your current position.</p>\n<p>There are also crates throughout the level that you are able to hide in by interacting with them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T13:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee1abf5263b1d548b0af5b46a36b8288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Syldarion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
