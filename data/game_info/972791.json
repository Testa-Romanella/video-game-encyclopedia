Together, you'll take on the daunting task of foiling a sinister scheme that could potentially devastate the entire world. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Ziggy wakes up one day with a strange mark on his hand, clueless about what happened the night before. After a couple of minutes lost amongst the familiar streets of his suburb, Orten, an explosion brings him back exactly where he woke up moments before\u2026 He\u2019s stuck in a time loop.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>With no shoes or recollection of the past, he goes on a mission to discover what the hell is going on and how to avoid the destruction of his city. This won\u2019t be easy though, cause the more he snoops in the wrong places, the more he learns that his hometown has a lot of secrets hidden. His weird neighbors become weirder, and he can only rely on his friends, and on his highly reliable brain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If the day repeats over and over, then how can one progress?
