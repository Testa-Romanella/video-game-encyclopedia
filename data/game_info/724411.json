One block may be removed from the tower at a time. After removing a block, a prompt will be displayed on screen. The player may consider this prompt on their own, or they may discuss it with friends or classmates. Once the discussion or reflection is completed, the player continues with the game by placing the block back on top of the tower. The goal is to repeat this process for as long as possible. If the tower topples over, the game will restart.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc9dab59509f468ca667b55ac8c457f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Resilience"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
