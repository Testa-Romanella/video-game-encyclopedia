Experiment to find out what works for you.</p>\n<p>There's no real gameplay other than placing blocks using a menu. I would have liked some resource management to be added to make it fit in a city builder kind of style title. I would also have liked to add more building options.<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry for the lame arrogant title :D,\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't think of anything else on time. Kind of the same for most of this jam. This is in no ways what I set out to make and feels below my standards, but I think it's good to upload anyway.\u00a0I wish I had more time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T09:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d3869ad6257430d58a6af5684f90149c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Telaba"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
