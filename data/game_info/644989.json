I decided to go with a monochromatic and 8-bit design, and base the gameplay off of the classic game \"Asteroids\" from Atari. Anyway, here are a few of the features:</p>\n<p>Simple game mechanics: You are a spaceship, which has the sole purpose of collecting the white \"energy pellets\" nearby. The only problem is, asteroids are everywhere and you don't have any weapons! Just avoid hitting\u00a0the asteroids and walls and make sure you collect the pellets in time, or you run out of energy...</p>\n<p>Increasing difficulty: As you steadily increase in survival, your spaceship will begin moving faster and faster. Try to keep up and remember to aim for the pellets!</p>\n<p><strong>PC Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Enter Key: Change direction &amp; start game</li><li>Escape Key: Quit game</li></ul>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy playing this fun little project I made. If you have any questions or ideas, just tell me in the comments. Happy gaming!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b1e86f14582ae7c55f15a2be8c70def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Novus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
