{"id": 973171, "slug": "soundtown", "name": "SoundTown", "name_original": "SoundTown", "description": "<strong>An accessible one-button music game for children with complex needs.</strong><br/><br/>Born out of my PhD research at the Glasgow School of Art, SoundTown is a game designed for - and with - children and young people with complex physical and cognitive needs.<br/><br/>The initial brief for SoundTown was developed through consultations with several appropriate organisations, including schools and charities with knowledge of accessible play. Built in the Unity game engine and powered by the Wwise audio engine, SoundTown consists of six minigames that are accessed directly through the Main Menu. <br/><br/>Players interact with SoundTown using a maximum of two buttons or switches. One button navigates the menus, whilst the other is used to select a minigame or play. Thus, SoundTown is explicitly accessible to players only capable of interaction with a single input device such as a switch, foot pedal, or the Xbox Adaptive Controller.<br/><br/>SoundTown is completely free to play and always will be.
