If you already know poker, learning Ten 2 Ten Poker is super simple! You don't have to worry about counting cards because all cards that have been dealt are always face up.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach poker hand you build is worth a certain amount of points. The player with the most points after 5 rounds wins. You can play by yourself, with a friend by creating/joining a private room, or against a random player with the Quick Match option.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach player is dealt 10 cards each and 2 community cards are placed in the middle. During each of your 5 turns you must select 5 cards to build a hand. This is where the strategy comes in. Will you play it safe and select a full house or will you save that 3 of a kind for the next round to see if you can build a 4 of a kind worth a ton of points? These are the types of the choices that make Ten 2 Ten Poker a fun and addicting card game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T05:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9b9076ee7a5f9f271b6466459762b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tentacle 51"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tentacle 51"], "esrb_rating": null}
