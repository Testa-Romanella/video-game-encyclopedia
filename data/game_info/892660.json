He is determined to do whatever it takes to get control of his life back, even if it means betraying his duty as a royal knight.</p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<p><strong>Story:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Click - next frame</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Battle:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - move\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Space - melee attack\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Left click - range attack</li></ul>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>Look out for weapon switch, it really makes things difficult! Your attack input changes as well - you can not attack using space when you have a bow, and you can't use left click during sword period. To proceed through the game, kill boss of each room and follow to the next one through opened door. Third room is the final one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:00:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625a575cd74413d8fc35f71607e6a373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oleg20111511"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
