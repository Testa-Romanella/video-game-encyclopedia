Your weapons can damage the spaceship you are meant to save and can ultimately cause its destruction!<br/><br/>Kill the aliens, save the spaceship, earn Bitcoins!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Command 6 exterminators, each with unique gameplay and tools of destruction.</li></ul><ul><li>Interact with spaceships\u2019 rooms: purge fires, open barred doors, activate defense turrets  and prevent the ship from self-destructing!</li></ul><ul><li>8 alien races to fight, each with their own gameplay and strategies.</li></ul><ul><li>Use your controller to aim at your foes and kill them! But don't miss or you'll damage the spaceship...</li></ul><ul><li>Critical decisions: choose carefully which exterminator to send into a mission (as death is (almost!) permanent), plan you attack on each spaceship and ponder when to activate the powerful Paradox Engine, a one-use-per-run machine that freezes a single instant and can then be activated to restore the continuum of space and time. You might even twist your timeline and revive dead exterminators with it\u2026 </li></ul><ul><li>Spaceships can be damaged by the aliens and by the exterminators aswell! </li></ul><ul><li>Earn Zipcoins, should you emerge victorious from a mission.
