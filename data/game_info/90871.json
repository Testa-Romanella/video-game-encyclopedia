This game also has levels to pick from, to learn how to take full advantage of our game controls and the strategies behind using them to be the best Survivor out there. We have a\u00a0challenging \u00a0AI system for the best players to make the most out of their game.<br/></p>\n\r\nIn Development\r\n This game is in Alpha.\r\n\r\n The enemies are in alpha mainly because they don't have any animations for their walking but they function as normal. The mode the game is currently set to is a mini survival map full of enemies with waves after killing a set amount of the enemies. The game doesn't have a lot to offer at this time but in future updates, it will get expanded massively in the future.\r\n\r\n<p>___________New Features (soon to come in future updates)__________</p>\n<p>- Gun customization (Attachments, Skins, Ect.)</p>\n<p>- More weapons + melee weapons</p>\n<p>- More maps</p>\n<p>- New game\u00a0modes (Team deathmatch {singleplayer}, Zombies, Ect.)</p>\n<p>- More Type Of\u00a0Enemies</p>\n<p>- Player Leg Texture</p>\n<p>- Open World Campaign (Will have a story and free roam survival)</p>\n<p>__________________________Current Controls__________________________</p>\n<p>Left Click - fire weapon \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Right Click - aim down gun sight</p>\n<p>W - move forward \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Escape - quit to\u00a0menu</p>\n<p>S - move backward\u00a0Left Shift - sprint</p>\n<p>A - move left \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Left Control - sneak\u00a0</p>\n<p>D - move right \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0F - to pick up weapons/parkour</p>\n<p>R - reload weapon \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G - drop weapon</p>\n<p>Spacebar - jump \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0E - drag objects around</p>\n<p>1 - select primary weapon \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02 - select secondary weapon\u00a0</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team is made up of three people.
