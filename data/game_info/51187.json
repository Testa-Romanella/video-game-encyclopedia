All of us love this stuff. But when you last time play a good puzzle game from first-person view, which has a lot of physical objects, you can interact with? I can't remember any game like this. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut guess what, now you have a chance to try something like this. Something with many different levels from very easy to such that take some time to figure them out. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will go through a lot of different locations, levels and various game elements, but the main goal of all of them is to shoot down all the marked cubes with the help of the ball. How will you do this? It's just a matter of your imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe more levels you can solve, the more things will be available in other ones, every next level will become more and more difficult, and more rooms will be opened for you and your adventures.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/64167897f613728ef6540f49aa41289e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChillFun"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["ChillFun"], "esrb_rating": null}
