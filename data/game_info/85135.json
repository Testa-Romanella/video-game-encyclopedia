The bravest is Tommy the Tiger who loves to laugh, jump, and spin, but be careful not to touch his belly because it will make him angry. Zack the Zebra is the dancer, whenever he hears music he starts to move his legs and shake his hips! Finally we have Edward the Elephants, a shy little guy who flies when you touch his big ears and is VERY afraid of little mice. Be careful when you touch his trunk, it\u2019s very sensitive!<br/><br/>As a new friend of the ZOO you should help keep everything clean and tidy. So when you see leaves on the ground pick them up! Your new friends will be very grateful. <br/><br/>DISCOVER ALL THE SURPRISES WE HAVE FOR YOU!<br/>Use your fingers to touch the legs, head, and belly of each animal and watch their funny reactions and animations.
