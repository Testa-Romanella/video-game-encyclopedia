Redsles are strong and resilient, but low in intelligence. Excellent for defence and security roles. Greenies are high in intelligence and are great workers. Fabulous for systems control. Bluehoos are quite anaemic and lifeless, but they consume alot of food, and can sometimes mess up their jobs. Assign jobs, weather random encounters, and reach your destination!!
