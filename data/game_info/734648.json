You will be amazed that this is freeware. Good 2D graphics, accompanied by animated movie introductions and great sound, this game scores high before you even start playing.</p>\n<p>You have the choice to be Amy, Knuckles, Sonic or Tails, each having their own special moves (the menu tells you how to do them) and each with their own game paths. What would a game be without extra bonuses? If you complete levels on Neo Sonic 3 you can unlock extra options!</p>\n<p>I recommend this to anybody and everybody. Download it and you will be as impressed as I was.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T19:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/033/0330f3099518cdd77fa2b3cafcc6900a.jpg", "website": "http://www.acid-play.com/download/neo-sonic-3-revelations", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
