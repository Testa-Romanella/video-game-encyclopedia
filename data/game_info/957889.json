But be careful! Don't stray too far into the unknown, who knows what lurks there in the shadows.</p>\n<p><em>Shuttle 62 is an atmospheric space adventure game created in my own engine 'Hex Engine'. This is the first game I have produced using this engine, and I am really pleased with the results. I hope you enjoy playing this short prototype game that was made for Mini Jam 130\u00a0. I'd love to continue developing it if enough people like it and see potential.</em></p><p><strong>Shuttle controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Normal controls (forward, backwards, left, right)</p><p>Q - Roll Left</p>\n<p>E - Roll right\r\n</p>\n<p>Ctrl - Pitch down\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Pitch up\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift - Booster\r\n</p>\n<p>Left mouse - fire the weapon (when it becomes enabled)\r\n</p>\n<p>Home - enter the shop (only usable when close enough to the moon)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T13:20:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62ea89f5984802f9b642a0dd6e339a8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HexPerson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
