{"id": 657159, "slug": "gone-kartin", "name": "Gone Kartin", "name_original": "Gone Kartin", "description": "<p>Gone Kartin is a racing game with multiple different karts and wheels that can be mixed and matched to then be raced with up to 60 AI and 4 players on different maps.</p>\n<p>This was made in one week\u00a0for the Brackeys 2021.2 Game Jam with the theme of \"Let there be chaos\" and I attempted to make a painfully chaotic racing game with elements from Mario Kart sprinkled in.</p>\n<p>Because of the time crunch of the game jam there's a lottt missing or needing to be fixed up, the vehicle controller is really something else but if you practice you can become pretty good at drifting around. There is also no sound at all, I figured that's better than really poor audio.</p>\n<p>There's also\u00a0items you can pick up on every map that can give you boosts or help you knock other karts out of the way in a manner of ways.</p>\n<p>As for multiplayer there's a crude split screen system but I didn't get around to adding controller inputs so the controls are as follows :</p>\n<p><strong>Player 1</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Use Item</p>\n<p><strong>Player 2</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys -\u00a0Movement</p>\n<p>Right Control - Use Item</p>\n<p><strong>Player 3</strong></p>\n<p>IJKL - Movement</p>\n<p>Enter Key - Use Item</p>\n<p><strong>Player 4</strong></p>\n<p>Numpad 8456 - Movement</p>\n<p>Numpad 0 - Use Item</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Numrow 1 - 5 will change the current color palette being used on all models so try them out and see if there's any you like.</p>\n<p>I wrote all of the scripts myself and I did all of the 3D\u00a0modeling myself too. The only resource I had to use was\u00a0https://www.textures.com/ for various miscellaneous textures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/0579669afc40d0a2a56eb837ad597e77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordan Millett"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
