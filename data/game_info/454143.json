Is it safe?\r\nA: Yes, Directplay is a Windows component. Your OS will download and install it from microsoft servers. It is safe and required for running the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Q: The game runs in a small square, even while in full screen. How do I make it expand to the entire screen?\r\nA: The game runs in a square screen format, up to a maximum of 1025X1025. If you monitor is in a higher resolution the fast workaround is to: 1) Right click on \"gamename.exe\" and go to Properties. 2) In the Compatibility tab check the \"Run in 640X480 screen resolution\" option, and apply. 3) Run the game, wait for it to load and press F10 until you find the resolution that best suits your monitor. Alternatively, if your video card drivers allow for custom settings for individual games, you can use that.</p>\n<p>Q: When I try running the game I get the error: \"Failed to load the game data. File seems corrupted\". What can I do?\r\nA: This is a common incompatibility issue with a lot of indie games, especially the ones made on Game Maker, and it seems to happen only in a few computers. The solution, as strange it sounds, is to delete all printer installed on your computer (even if you do not own a printer). This fix seemed to work for everyone who ran across this issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8246b5f0d68ca4cd8f47a1ba0defee76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amaweks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
