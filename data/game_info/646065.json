The objective was for bunnies to steal carrots from the farm while farmers prevent them by shooting at them.</p>\n<p>Of course, I was one of the two bunnies while the farmers were a bunch of my close real-life friends, who wants to shoot me for reasons (Both in game and probably real life too).</p>\n<p>Because making this dream joke game a multiplayer one is very expensive in terms of time and efforts (And this is a joke game, I shouldn't take it very seriously, I just want to get it out of my head), I decided to make it a \"Bunnies vs Farmer\", where you have to prevent bunnies from stealing your carrots by shooting at them with a confetti gun in 100 seconds in darkness because the bunnies attack at night.</p>\n<p>Please don't take this game seriously, no bunnies were hurt while making this game. I'm as confused as you are, trust me.</p>\n<p>If you, for some reason, feel the need to contact me, catch me on:</p>\n<p>Twitter: @Q8GEEK</p>\n<p>Instagram: @Q8GEEK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa26943e78dd5470cefd71945835c61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["q8geek"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
