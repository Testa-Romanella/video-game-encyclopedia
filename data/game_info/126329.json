There are 2 players and 1 bot in every game. You either play as a detective or deceiver, and as a detective, your role is to decipher and name who the bot is by asking a limited amount of questions, whereas the deceiver's role is to fool the detective into thinking you're the bot.</p>\r\nGameplay Mechanics\r\n<p>The game features a single multiplayer mode, with various difficulties (from Easy to Hard), and an optional singleplayer mode should there be no players available.

I've recently picked it up and finished it off, seeing the potential for the game. It is <em>completely</em>\u00a0free to play, but I would <em>sincerely </em>appreciate a donation, no matter how small or big, for the work I've put into the game. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/291/291eead472c49724bcb4e9af040fc0fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CarnageGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
