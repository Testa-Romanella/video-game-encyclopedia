What interactions await her over the course of her commute, and how does she react to them?<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short-form point and click game made in 1 week for #ResistJam, and briefly explores the topics of diversity, inclusiveness, tolerance, racism, bigotry, sexism, Islamophobia, and homophobia.<br/></p>\n<p>Urban subways are a petri-dish of society. Diverse elements are forced into a confined space. This game explores what it is like to be on the receiving end of hate speech, and asks the question of what do we do when hate speech happens to us and to others.</p>\n<p><strong>To be clear:</strong><strong> This is not a game about religion or theology.</strong> It's set in a game world populated by cute anthropomorphic cats! The game's goal is to help the player explore what it is like to be a victim of discrimination and hate speech, and also see the immediate choices we have when we are bystanders witnessing hate speech/crimes being committed.</p><p>Here is a Brazilian adaption of the game (in Portuguese).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: Simple Point and Click</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move</strong>: Click at where you want to walk.
