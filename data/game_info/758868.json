As the sunrise appears in the horizon, I like to put on some good music and enjoy the company of the birds that usually come to visit me. Sometimes I even forget to turn off the stove. Dammit, it appears that someone is on the door, maybe they will go away if I ignore it for a while\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Took me a while to complete this project of the Unity Essentials course, used the opportunity to learn more about audio, lighting (directional, baking, mixed and more), terrain, postprocessing and few other little things. There were a bunch of free assets that I used from the Asset Store (some may from the Ukranian Pack, so not free) and a lot of tutorials that I followed, I\u2019ll try to remember all of them here (I\u2019m sorry if I forget some).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pictures up on the wall are some of my favorites from this year\u2019s new hobby, birdwatching (you can see them with more details using the QR Code!). You can use the \u201cF\u201d key to interact with the radio and to turn off the water boiling in the stove (I really suggest doing it, so you can enjoy the other sounds a little better). If you go near to the radio you can change the songs with the keys 1, 2 and 3.</p>\n\n<p>3D Model: \u201cRadio\u201d by trippsmith05.\r\n</p>\n<p>Song: \u201cMiss Lexotan 6 Mg Garota\u201d, \u201cUm Lugar do Caralho\u201d and \u201cBeatle George\u201d by Jupiter Ma\u00e7\u00e3.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effect: \u201cKnocking on the door\u201d by oldhiccup\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Assets:\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAllSky Free - 10 Sky / Skybox Set\u201d by rpgwhitelock;\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDoor Free Pack Aferar\u201d by Andrey Ferar;\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cEnhanced Hierarchy 2.0\u201d by Muka Schultze;\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cFantasy landscape\u201d by Pxltiger\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cFootsteps - Essentials\u201d and \u201cNature - Essentials\" by Nox_Sound\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cFoundations of Audio\u201d and \u201cTerrain Sample Asset Pack\u201d by Unity Technologies Inc.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneric Terrain Brushes\u201d by FlamingSands\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLiving Birds\u201d by dinopunch;\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNature Starter Kit 2\u201d by Shapes\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cRealistic Forest Textures - RPG Environment\u201d by Blink\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrain Toolkit Re:\u201d by heparo\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrain Tools\u201d by mgear\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWater Shader (URP &amp; LWRP)\u201d by Easy Game Studio\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Youtube Tutorials:\r\n</p>\n<p>Harnessing Light with URP and the GPU Lightmapper | Unite Now 2020, by Ciro Continisio (Unity).\r\n</p>\n<p>Using Terrain Tools to Create 3D Landscapes (Unity Tutorial), by Ketra Games\r\n</p>\n<p>Interior Lighting in URP (Universal Render Pipeline) | Unity 2020.2, by UGuruz\r\n</p>\n<p>7 Ways to Optimize your Unity Project with URP, by Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity3D - Random Music Playlist, by Stuart Spence\r\n</p>\n<p>How to optimize your Unity game for Mobile, PC &amp; WebGL: from 230MB to 3.7MB, by GameDevLuuk\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And some textures from https://3dtextures.me/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:04:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12db3c8ca82b7b60c7afba3e25667e6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vin\u00edcius A. de Souza"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
