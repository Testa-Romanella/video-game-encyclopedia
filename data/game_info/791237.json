This is the first of many and hopefully they can only get better.</p>\n<p>In this game you complete 4 Mr. Beast inspired challenges to earn money through video views. But be careful that you don't earn too much too quickly. If you hit your money limit you lose.\u00a0 Complete challenges to expand the money limit. Give money away to reset the view popularity timer and keep money flowing in.\u00a0\u00a0Win the game by earning $1,000,000.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Some things I forgot:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A victory screen... <em>(oops)</em></li></ul>\n<ul><li>A way to exit the game without hitting the game over screen<em> (bigger oops)</em></li></ul>\n<p>Anyways, this was just for fun and it's a terrible game. I did put a secret challenge though, so comment if you figured out what it was it! I also experimented with this idea of flipping the 2D environment... Let me know what you think of that.<br/><br/>Zip file includes Build and complete Project file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T15:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba8/ba8b4a127354b97d9cdcdf173c9de87a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VARIGON STUDIOS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
