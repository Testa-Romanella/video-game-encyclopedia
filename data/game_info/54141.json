(Where's Wally? in the UK, Australia and South America) is a puzzle game developed by Bethesda Softworks and published in 1991 by THQ for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Mostly similar to the books, players must help Waldo get to the moon by finding him in each of the eight levels in the game.</p>\n<p>The game was panned by critics, who criticized the game for its graphics, which made it more difficult to find Waldo in each of the levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d19/d191d2018ec3988a4e8a538151e22e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["THQ", "Toy Headquarters"], "esrb_rating": null}
