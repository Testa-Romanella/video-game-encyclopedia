When they accomplish that, they get buffed and get stronger. This is limited to one enemy at a time only. All the weapons that the players can use can only be obtained by searching the map. There can be a small task the players must do to proceed. The players can pick up toy pieces to use as utility items to help them finish the game.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is currently in development and I will keep posting here in the dev logs the current state of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b740be04e33ec5dd87fad5d0f806d6b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ricardo aka.\"Naidio\" Teixeira"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
