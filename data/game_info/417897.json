This node will take a free id (1,2,3,4...), u cant change it.</p>\n<p>-Modifie a node, clicking left-click above a node there will appear a small UI menu with 2 buttons, left one to delete de node and right one to link it with another node and make an edge.</p>\n<p>-UI information, at the top of the screen u can see 2 texts that indicates the nodes that are placed (with his id) and the edges (with this format: <id1,id2> where id1 is the id from the start node and id2 from the end node that compose the edge). In the bottom u can a text that says: \"Stack = \", that indicate what node is prepared to be linked with another node, if u want to clear the stack u can press C.</id1,id2></p>\n\n<p>Finally i uploaded a zip file named\u00a0\"ScriptS_GT\" with all the scripts coded in this project for\u00a0someone that wants to learn how it works. Enjoy the project as i do developing it\u00a0&lt;3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc32973ade4157d59e63bbd1be7c36ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vitolo Paolo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
