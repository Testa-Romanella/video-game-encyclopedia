Your role is simple.<br/><br/>You are a cat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can jump, you can walk, you can push stuff around, also, you can trigger switches. If you manage to eat some fish, our experiment is complete and you win. Also, you happen to be able to die.</p>\n<p>You were a cat.</p>\n<p>You still can jump, walk and push stuff around, but you cannot trigger switches. You could still try and get the fish, and we are sure that your corpse is going to be useful to do that. Also, you cannot die twice, so good for you.</p>\n<p>You could be a cat again.</p>\n<p>Thanks to state-of-the-art box powerups, future is today, and dead cats can be brought back to life in matter of seconds (only downside is that, well, new bodies appear out of nowhere so the corpses start to pile up).</p>\n<p>Accompany us in five unique experiments.</p>\n<p>Hand-crafted platformer levels with puzzle mechanics to solve, using your wit, a computer-generated kitty cat and some kitty corpses. No time limits, no pressure, just you and our five special challenges.</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>Game developed in 72hrs as an entry for Wowie Jam 3.0</p>\n<p>Development team: \"Login Studios\"</p>\n<p>Programming: Andres Forero, Victor Madera</p>\n<p>Graphics: Lucia Romero, Jose Miguel Ortega</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>We hope that you enjoy your brief stay here at Schrod Box.</p>\n<p>Please, comment.
