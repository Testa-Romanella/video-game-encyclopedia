While this sounds easy, you can't slow down and always move forward, your brain must be quick and your hands must be even quicker to dodge all the sharp turns ahead!</p>\n<p>Will I eventually make a game I will stick to and not a prototype?\u00a0Who knows LOL. I am honestly just having fun at the moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I switched back to Unity for the time being, I wanted to just use Unity for now for my 3D game creation, and if I ever really reach the 10k ( or 100k?\u00a0) threshold\u00a0 ill probably switch to Godot, but I am too lazy to reach that so Ill just have fun creating weird prototypes from tutorials and such and maybe make something worth while, who knows?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't expect updates, but I have some ideas that may or may not come, but don't expect them in short amounts, currently in the Navy so while I have no internet on the Ship, Ill most likely be spending a lot of my time creating levels rather than going outside as I am an introvert :p ( LOL ).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>( Also Company name change soon, still jumping between names at the moment though\u00a0\u00a0).</p>\n<p>Planned Updates:</p>\n<p>- Two Player Mode ( or One Player can control Two cubes at the same time\u00a0)</p>\n<p>- More Levels</p>\n<p>- Death Counter ( I tried adding it in Version 1, but couldn't figure it out )</p>\n<p>- Jump Pad</p>\n<p>- Speed Boost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T07:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/025eacabe9506817025bb1b3b16fa9b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mideons"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
