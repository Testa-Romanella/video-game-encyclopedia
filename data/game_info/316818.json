A remake of the original Microsoft Windows version of Far Cry, Instincts is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console&#39;s reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the Microsoft Windows version&#39;s vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts added new multiplayer modes, weapons, and feral abilities, the latter being reflected in the modified storyline.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2005-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-25T09:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c60/c6078a759c0e6c91fbd7571fea46343d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 6, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
