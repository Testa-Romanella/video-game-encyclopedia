You will find a detailed\u00a0documentation of the code inside the cartridge.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to scale a sprite from size 0 to X (however large it should become), and shift its position by a movement vector each frame (determining the speed and direction of movement). The movement vector is based on a random point on the unit circle (direction) that is multiplied by a scaling factor (speed).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/57136a8ba736282f5da5219142c9691c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["jaronimoe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
