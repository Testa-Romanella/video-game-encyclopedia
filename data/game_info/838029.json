(you can also make them jump by crouching and standing when they are above you)</p>\n<p>The goal is to help your fellow Goomba get to the house, and you have to go as well.</p>\n<p>To do so, you will need to COLLABORATE WITH AI since he can't get there without you, and you can't get there without him.
