It's a system for resolving challenges with a d20. To resolve a challenge, the characters must tackle tasks,\u00a0</p>\n<p>The GM will roll a difficulty dice. A character must roll above that number, or they fall short, and\u00a0below their\u00a0Competence + their Approach dice. If they roll above that number, they fail by trying too hard.</p>\n<p>The Competences are stats based on the setting being played. If you play a fantasy setiing, your competences might be Moxie, Sorcery and Sehanigans. If you play Sci-Fi, swap that for Blasting, Sliceing and Shenanigans. Wanna play a Slice of Life game? What about Fun, Charming and Awkward? It really is up to you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06ccd909595abe316701d2ae28d12abc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel Caetano"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
