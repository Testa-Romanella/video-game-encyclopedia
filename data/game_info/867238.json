I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s about 60 Hours long.</p>\n<p><em>Q: How long did this take to make?</em>\n<br/>\r\nA:  About two and a half years, though I took many breaks from working on  it due to being a full-time college student (after some gap years) and  having other projects I\u2019ve been working on.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Q: Who made this? What kind of person makes this? Can you tell us about yourself because I need to know what\u2019s wrong with you???\r\n<br/>\n</em>A:  I\u2019m very sorry to tell you that a very hot goth artsy nonbinary femboy made  this game. I hope that makes the game more intimidatingly powerful.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Q: If this is a heavily Persona inspired  game will it be re-released with a single new dungeon in a few years  with a new marketable character tacked on?</em>\n<br/>\r\nA: Buddy if enough  people find this funny and enjoy playing it, you know it! That and if  enough people would like to help me add full blown voice acting in a  re-release, which would be one of my major focuses for an enhanced  version.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Q</em>:\u00a0<em>Why did you make this?</em><br/>A: I was really bored during the worst stretch of the\u00a0pandemic. Originally this was a small crude gag game I was making years and years and years ago that I scrapped, but I completely revamped it into something much more elaborate and surreal as a little distraction to keep me busy while quarantining. It sort-of functioned as a low stake testing ground for less facetious games I plan on releasing in the near future. There\u2019s also an underlying commentary on how obnoxious and outlandish unnecessary sequels to self-contained and subdued stories are, which can be seen in how ridiculously unhinged the game is with constantly recontextualizing various minute-details of the original movie and retconning things as if it was all deep foreshadowing.\u00a0</p>\n<p> <em> <em>Q</em>: <em>Why are you acting like Ratatouille is some kind of  game series?\r\n<br/>\n</em></em>A: In the past, in the really early beginnings  of making this game, I had this whole elaborate ARG thing I would often  joke about with friends where I would  insist the movie was just a really bad faithless adaption of a video  game series developed by Platinum Games and published by Atlus. There  were jokes about the name\u00a0\u201cRemy\u201d being a\u00a0\u201cdumb movie adaption thing\u201d and  that Ratatouille <em>is</em> in fact the proper name. The  implication was that the \u201cDisney movie adaption\u201d was so bad it killed  off the game series until this sequel came out well over a decade later  due to \u201cvocal fan support.\u201d  This eventually died down a bit, but some of the  ironic ARG stuff has lingered.</p>\n<p>One part of the ARG was originally going to be that there were two people working on this game instead of one and that they\u2019d have a messy public falling out on the game\u2019s tumblr blog, but this was scrapped because it felt too explosive lol</p>\n\n<p><em>Q: What do you mean by this being a sequel to Ratatouille for Wii and Ratatouille PSP? Aren\u2019t those the same game?</em> <br/>A:\u00a0 While the Ratatouille tie-in game on most consoles was just a movie adaption, the PSP version was one of those weird tie-in games that takes place after the movie. I never beat the game but the plot entails Chef Skinner stealing all the recipe cards from the new restaurant around the time of their grand opening, and Rem- Ratatouille having to retrieve them. This is recited as some sort of major, melodramatic event in Rata2ouille. Ratatouille PSP has a lot of scrapped side-characters from the movie appear (such as rats named Celine, Dodo, Twitchy all of whom were meant to appear in the movie and were in the official art book) in addition to very odd new characters such as Teen Rat, who is seemingly a Sonic the Hedgehog pastiche that challenges Remy to races. These game-exclusive characters are all treated as if they\u2019re established characters from the movie that we should know and recognize so when I discovered they exist halfway through development, I retroactively added a bunch of them into this game and treated them exactly the same here. I did a lot of deep diving into the production of the movie and its tie-in material while making this game and referenced a lot of niche stuff -- in order to be as bizarre as possible, I also needed to be as \u201cauthentic\u201d as possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T13:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e9e5fe330b48a0849d74805abd852af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Just a Speck"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
