Everything used in the game except for the music, was created by me, David A. Rosales. The music credit goes to my roommate, Joe Iosue. This game is not complete yet as I am currently working on an interesting story line with a new zombie twist. However, there is currently an arcade mode that has plenty of features for you to enjoy. Eventually, story mode will be added and the price will go up to $5. Since it is currently incomplete, the game is $0.99.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298bad049767c1f5c53233a5e49cbf55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DragonCookiez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
