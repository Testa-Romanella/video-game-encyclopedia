As a birthday present for a friend of mine. It was one of my first platformers, it's really nothing special.\u00a0I made it really hard so i can offer him a challenge. Decided to upload it now! Sorry for the clunkiness and terrible colliders! I really didn't know what i was doing... Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Music from : WOWSoundsg + Trevor Lentz\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/battle-rpg-music-pack/</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/at-what-cost</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/hidden-oasis<br/></p>\n\n<p>Cheat : If you want to skip a level press f2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46b/46bf2090b73829bb8de2aad50c651c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ambient Melancholy"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
