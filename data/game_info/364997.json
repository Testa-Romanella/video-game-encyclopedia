{"id": 364997, "slug": "codebreaker-2", "name": "Codebreaker", "name_original": "Codebreaker", "description": "<h3>So, you think you're smart?</h3><br/>Can you figure out what characters have been switched in a garbled text? Can you learn to decode a message sent using Morse code? Can you grasp the concept of storing information using only numbers? Or how these numbers are represented using only zeroes and ones? Can you memorize a string of numbers, letters or images? Are you able to identify what's missing from a sequence of numbers, letters or symbols?<h3>Are you sure?</h3><br/>You begin with deciphering a message where the characters have been switched, with the help of several hints. This begins the Character Substitution path. As you complete more challenges, you'll unlock other paths with different types of challenges. Each path begins fairly easy, but difficulty increases rapidly.<h3>Is this for you then?</h3><br/>This is not an action game. It will not put your reflexes to the test (although some parts of it requires speed and coordination). The game is about challenging your mind. It helps if you are analytical, good at spotting patterns and have an eye for logic. And, of course, you need a fair amount of patience. <br/><br/>Ever heard the phrase \"Easy to learn, difficult to master\"? Well, in this case it's true.<h3>Now, do you have what it takes to be a Codebreaker?</h3>Then, by all means, give it a try. But don't say you weren't warned and don't come crying to us if it turns out you weren't as smart as you thought.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55d26ddbdfeab70c14be87c3970c707.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thor Gaming"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thor Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
