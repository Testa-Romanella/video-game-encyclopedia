In reality, the functions which check open windows are (apparently) broken and the game A) runs very slowly and B) marks shapes as complete when they clearly aren't.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tjetro</em> is a mod of Bennett Foddy's\u00a0<em>Murder</em>. It is a competitive shape-making game based on Neil Cicierega's short\u00a0<em>Game Boy mystery\u00a0</em>series. You play Russian spies making radio transmitters based on Tetris technology, anticipating being sent off to infiltrate Nintendo factories and hide the transmitters in the upcoming Game Boy line of products.</p>\n<p>Class:\u00a0Pixel Prototype</p>\n<p>Assignment: Mod One Of Bennett Foddy's Made-For-This-Class Prototypes</p>\n<p>Postmortem:\u00a0Given that the actual assignment was to familiarize ourselves with the engine, I'm proud of this gigantic mess. I still believe that the idea behind the weird competitive puzzle game is interesting, especially with the push/pull between\u00a0losing track of yourself behind windows and trying to complete shapes quickly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/673c642a105d8ba84c6b7eea2662337b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshMelnick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
