It never had many players, but the few active ones remaining gather one last time to say goodbye.</p>\n<p>Walk around one of the initial areas, talk to some players, and enjoy your last 5 minutes in the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-The game is quite simple, because i've only now started to learn how to program. The limitations set by Pico-8 also help out, as i wanted something simple and quite sad, with a feeling of finality, and emptiness. There's not much to see, but i also like that about the game.<br/></p>\n<p>My only disappointment is that i never figured out how to put music in the game. And i ran out of time to find out. Hopefully, next time i make a game, i'll be able to add some music~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:43:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/9869ad7155448b973062ac98b904b802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ForeverMuffin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
