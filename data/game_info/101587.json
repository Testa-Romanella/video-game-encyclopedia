If somebody is on your shoulders, your job is to move around and avoid piranhas. If you're on somebody's shoulders, your job is to keep balanced and push the other person off.</p>\n<p>Just a heads up, this is my submission for BGSjamX, and BGSjam is when I break out all my weird multiplayer ideas, so you'll need a few gamepads and friends to play this game. If you only have two gamepads, players 3 and 4 can be controlled with WASD/C and arrows/M.</p><p>The music and sound effects were, once again, made by Tim Schrock.
