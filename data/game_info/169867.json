The final product after 48 hours of work was a barebones turn-based combat system with all the overly complex combat explained through textboxes.</p><p>Resources Used:</p><p>GameMaker Studio 1</p><p>FL Studio 12</p><p>Blender</p><p>Famitracker</p>\n\n<p>-KNOWN ISSUES-</p>\n<p>-Overall lack of polish (but give me a break here)</p>\n<p>-Sudden, jarring transitions out of battle (see above)</p>\n<p>-If you fail to flee, the game will crash when you try to attack (okay, my bad)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/631/63128c40c0237d185dc8ee7c5b150732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NickHenley"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
