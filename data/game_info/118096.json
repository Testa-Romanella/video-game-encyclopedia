There's no story, only shooting and points. The catch: to earn points, you burn resources by firing your Point Gun -- the same resources you'll need to upgrade your weapons to shoot more stuff to earn more resources...</p><p>Plus Gun is a game about doing two things at once: While wave after wave of enemies bear down on you, you'll need to remember to take a break and shoot some points, and occasionally navigate the Buy menu ('E' on your keyboard) to upgrade your guns.
