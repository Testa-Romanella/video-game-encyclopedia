This is crucial to know for the 4th level<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to De Overval!<br/>This is a heist game where you have to steal briefcases from an experimental laboratory while avoiding traps using your one time use tools.</p>\n<p>You have as much time as you want to prepare and plan, but once you steal the first briefcase, or you get seen by cameras, the alarm timer starts and you have only a limited amount of time to steal the rest and get out alive!</p>\n<p>Each level is beatable, and was designed with 1 solution in mind, but there is very possibly other solutions to each level.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!
