I used this build to show off my game at our in-house-exhibition!<br/></p>\n<p>It features 3 levels, secret collectibles and a tiny proc-gen-demo!<br/><br/>This is the first Unity game I have developed, and as such expect a few bugs. Nonetheless, I am pretty proud of this game, and the things I have learned while working on it! I hope you enjoy playing it!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/962/96276e85c814b0a41d236609e4f1f04f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jannik Boysen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
