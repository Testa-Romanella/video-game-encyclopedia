You're trying to link green start tiles with red goal tiles on each level before you reach a certain number of moves. You can slide tiles to empty spots around them. Each level has a set number of moves you can do before you have to reset.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also two powerup types. You can connect green tiles to \"+30 tiles\" to get 30 extra moves. You can also connect them to \"bomb tiles\" to get an extre empty spot on the level grid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the GGJ2020 version, there are three levels. I intend to release a version with more levels. But you can create your own levels by creating new *.csv files in the \\GGJ2020_data\\StreamingAssets\\Levels folder. There's no proper documentation but it'll be updated. There are tile types from 0 to 11. Try them out to see which tiles they correspond to. Good luck and have fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arhan Bakan\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter: @arhanbakan\u00a0</p>\n<p>Facebook: \\arhanbakan\u00a0</p>\n<p>Linkedin: \\in\\arhanbakan\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a556fa1c9494a1cde833e5f9476be23e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arhpositive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
