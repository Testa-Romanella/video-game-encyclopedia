The King has gotten numerous complaint letters from the villagers about the Duke's terrible job at running things. The Duke has been corrupted by greed and power so he has gotten into his head that Snowglobe needs to take part in global financial competition. Therefore the Duke has built a factory in his castle that manufactures ice cubes for foreign markets. The factory has caused different kind of harm to villagers: they have to work in the factory every day for very small payment, pollution from the factory has made the air smell bad and it has also started global warming.
