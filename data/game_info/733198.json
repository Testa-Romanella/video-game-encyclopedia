Well now you don't need to,\u00a0as a reimagining of what a gameboy Persona 4 might be like comes to reality and on\u00a0<strong>actual hardware</strong> with the rom file attached below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project was made with the GB Studio engine, a free engine that lets you create your own gameboy games, and Persona 4 GB was actually one of my first projects using the engine! This demo only lets you play the very beginning Persona 4, and has around 5-15 ish\u00a0minutes of play time. This isn't the full game of Persona 4 on gameboy, and is only a demo of what Persona 4 might be like if it was developed and released earlier on the gameboy. I hope you enjoy this fun little project that I had worked on\u00a0over a year ago, and who knows, maybe I'll post some updates in the future! (maybe even follow my itch or twitter to find out wink wink nudge nudge)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>-SeanSS</p>\n<p>MUSIC CHIPTUNE\u00a0CREDITS</p>\n<p>Aria of The Soul - Free Piano Tutorials</p>\n<p>Corner of Memories - atomsk</p>\n<p>Heartbeat Heartbreak -atomsk</p>\n<p>New Days -atomsk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:32:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda4c1d037af4f7a3c7198b25eed7d2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SeanSS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
