It ended up in 47th place overall in the jam, which had 237 entries.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t You play a knight, cursed to wander the halls of the dungeon of a huge orc named Gygan, bent on killing him so you can bring peace to the realm. He, however, has other plans for you. Will you be able to reclaim your power and defeat Gygan?\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith this game, we wanted to explore a mechanic contradictory to most combat based Roguelikes: the feeling of facing tougher enemies over time. We decided to make it so you face the toughest opponents at the beginning and, as you die to them, you revive on a lower level where the difficulty lowers a bit. This repeats until you beat a level, after which you start climbing up levels again until you face the boss again!\r\n</p><p>\r\nCode by <strong>Henrique Campos </strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t Blog\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Art and Some Code by <strong>Joana Almeida</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t Blog | Twitter | E-mail\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t Music and SFX by <strong>Jo\u00e3o Higino</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/0921c05cb3b7df78d942356bf042fd9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joana Almeida"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
