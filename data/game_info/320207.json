{"id": 320207, "slug": "pixel-creature", "name": "Pixel Creature", "name_original": "Pixel Creature", "description": "<p><strong>Background:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pixel Creature is a game where player creates creatures, which can eat, mate and evolve!</p>\n<p>Each creature has its own DNA, defining their shapes and how they move around. Once two creatures create a child. That child will inherit parts of the DNA from its parents.</p>\n<p>Over time, creatures adapt to the change of environment, generating interesting behaviours and shapes.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>The screen is split into two: Crafting Table and Map.</p>\n<p>One the left side of the screen, player uses Crafting Table to create creatures. Three types of creature can be created: Green, Yellow &amp; Red. Player can click on the Green, Yellow or Red square to select which type of creature to create.</p>\n<p>Red creature only eats Yellow creature. Yellow creature only eats Green creature. Green creature only eats tiny green squares.</p>\n<p>All creatures will die eventually and release tiny green squares, which can be eaten by Green creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The goal is to generate as many Yellow creatures as possible. Each time, a yellow pixel is generated, the score increases by one. (Yellow creature consists of yellow pixels).</p>\n<p>(Green or Red creatures can also evolve to have Yellow pixels with a small chance through mutation. The Yellow pixels on non-Yellow creature will also increase the score!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6adbb37aaa0ad4edbadd62811c60c2ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dannydaisun"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
