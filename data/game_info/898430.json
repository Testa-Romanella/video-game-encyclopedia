One: she's deeply in love with her best friend, <strong>Allison</strong>. (The feeling was mutual.) And two: if Allison has her heart set on being an adventurer, then maybe Melody can join her. As a healer.<br/><br/>It all seemed perfect. And then things got weird.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Super Lesbian Animal RPG is a game about love, anxiety, and fighting funny looking monsters in dungeons. It follows the stories of Melody, her girlfriend Allison, and their friends <strong>Claire</strong>, a rule-bending witch, and <strong>Jodie</strong>, a dependable knight. Over the course of their journey, our inexperienced heroes will meddle with forces beyond their control and find themselves responsible for the fate of their hometown. They'll also fight some spherical frogs, travel to a forgotten land in the sky, befriend a robot or two, and piss off the local librarian. But that should go without saying.<h3>FEATURES:</h3><br/><ul><li>    A 16-bit-ish RPG inspired by classics like Final Fantasy, Mother, and Paper Mario, with modern sensibilities!
