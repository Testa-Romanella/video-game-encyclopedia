Beat the information out of those bastards but don\u2019t overdo that - you need them alive.<br />\nRick Bronx, your trusted partnerKeep your fellow operative close at all times and point him in right directions - this will improve your chance of success and you will less likely be killed. Rick has wide array of special equipment: peek through doors, blast them, blind your enemies and much more.<br />\nEach time is a new timeBe careful - you will never know where the enemy will be and how he will react.
