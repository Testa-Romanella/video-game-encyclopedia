During the whole game experience you just need to focus on the button on the single-key telegraph, typing some Morse codes, reading the text, and feeling the story. The game is about a man, John, and his childhood sweetheart \u2013 Alice, who engaged but separated by the inhumane warfare. The player will be playing John to send telegrams to ensure the victory of the war \u2013 and also Alice\u2019s love for him.<br/></p>\n<p>I am basically a programmer, learning painting during leisure time, which means magnificent illustration and animation are very unfriendly to me. However, the relaxing and immersive experience I found in Florence showed me a new angle of creating video game: being simple, but also compelling. Then, here came The Voice of Heart, in which you will not hurt your finger, but you may simply elegantly press at the only button and watch the story.</p><p>Here is the\u00a0demo of the game. After playing it , I believe you will have a\u00a0 general idea of how\u00a0<em>The Voice of Heart\u00a0</em>is played.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd3d5dcc3ac3ce3fc7dd3d72a38632e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SHYLeo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
