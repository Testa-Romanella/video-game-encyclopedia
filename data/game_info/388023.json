{"id": 388023, "slug": "bwrgb", "name": "BWRGB", "name_original": "BWRGB", "description": "<p>BWRGB (Black, White, Red, Green, Blue) is a small puzzle game made using the Godot game engine. Since I haven't made a complete game yet, I wanted to make something small from start to finish. I spent about a week on this project.</p>\n<p>The first 8 levels are \"Tutorial\" levels and then there\u00a0are 10 levels after that. The goal of the game\u00a0is to guide Robi, the Godot mascot, to the \"finish\" square (stars) by left clicking on squares.\u00a0 Only valid squares will highlight when hovered by the mouse.\u00a0The player can walk on white/grey cells. Energy is absorbed from colored squares which will fill the energy meters.\u00a0 Once all 3 meters are full,\u00a0\u00a0this energy can be used to energize\u00a0colored squares to make them white/grey (walk-able).</p>\n<p>My purpose for creating this was to create a \"full\" first game without the complexity and pressure of a larger project. It was a good experience and I learned several valuable things in the process.</p>\n<p>There are 2 known bugs in the game.\u00a0 The first will require the player to \"reload\" the level if it is encountered.\u00a0 If you click on a key and it disappears and then reappears, the game will be stuck and you will be unable to perform an action.\u00a0 If this occurs, please reload the level and try again.\u00a0 I would say that there is a 5-10% chance this will happen.\u00a0 The second\u00a0is only visual., but may cause some confusion.\u00a0 If a square remains highlighted, it has gotten stuck in the \"highlight\" state.\u00a0 Simply hovering the mouse on it and then off of it should return it to the non-highlighted state.\u00a0 I apologize that these are still in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb00b573dcb862137b385f9ae8ecf9ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haplotyper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
