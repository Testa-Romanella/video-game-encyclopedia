That's all you'll going to do.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>* Quite Difficult:</strong></em> The game is aimed for those who are looking for a challenging platformer and speed runners. Difficulty based on level design, not on cheap deaths or surprise attacks. May provoke some rage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>* Casual Support:</strong></em> You may progress in the game even if you die a thousand times and take 3 hours to finish a level. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>* Rewards for hardcore:</strong></em> Earn medals for not dying and milestones for completing some requirements.\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>* Realistic storyline: </strong></em>Yep.
