The game is a prototype please treat is as such.</p>\n<p>FlingShot is a game about a sidekick who has to help out the hero in saving \"countless\" lives during various disasters. You have telekinetic powers and you have to fling people to safety. Be careful with your power though because humans are pretty fragile and can be harmed during the process. If everyone is in safety before the hero runs out of his power then you win the day...or do you?</p>\n<p>Just click on a human to pick him up and hold the mouse button to drag him around. When you let go of the mouse button you let go of the human as well. (NOTE: To skip the dialog, press the Escape key.)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this little game jam game. This is my first finished entry to the LudumDare game jam so I did enjoy creating it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/994bda4fe78af8b86d091dc7ee7cf2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BenJoe72"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
