It taught that the being is one, indivisible and immobile, that multiplicity and movement are only illusions. This doctrine was accused of incoherence by its opponents. In order to defend his master, Zeno devised a series of arguments that would show that the positions of these detractors were, more than any other, burdened with incoherence. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T03:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/787/787fd867c47b1d4a797f5e2fbeb3a6ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["aestheticoffailure"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
