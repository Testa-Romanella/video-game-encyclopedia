Players are given the same layouts for each level but can only see one-half of it: what is invisible to one player is visible to the other, and vice-versa. In order to progress, both players must complete the level by figuring out effective communication strategies to guide the other through their \u201cblindsides.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Player 1's perspective:</p>\n\n<p>Player 2's perspective:</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made over the course of a semester for a class at the University of Utah called \"Alternative Game\u00a0Development.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Isaac White - Programming, Design, Art, Music/Sound</p>\n<p>Arjun Shivakumar - Design</p>\n<p>Owen Templeton - Design</p>\n<p>John Richard - Art, Programming, Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be4a7fd27195d8ae0aa00d1d9bb3f61a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WaffleWorks"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
