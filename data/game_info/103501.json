Now you turn 'em poachers into slaves and put them in a cage, and you force them to play different instrument sections for your pleasure.</p><p>After looking at an instrument section with Slaves on it, you can force them to:</p><p>1.Raise or lower the volume of the section, moving your hand up or down.</p><p>2.Increase or reduce the rhythm, moving your hand left and right. It changes the speed when a complete Left-&gt;Right-Left circle is complete, due to smart algorithms that know what's good for you. The hand must be moved to the border of the screen in each case. Example: When moving to the Left, the Trunk Tip must touch the left border.</p><p>3.Grab the slaves and throw them around by pinching. Please note, keep your hand completely opened at all times except when you want to grab! Kittens died because of this!</p><p>This settings only change when looking at the section. If you want to fix them (though they decay when unnatended), just look to a different section before moving your hand.</p><p>Motivation increases when you keep the Volume and Speed in the Line marked with a Star. If you don't, slaves will hate you for destroying the songs of their childhood, and will try to escape when Motivation reaches 0.</p><p>If you see a bug, it was totally intended.</p><p>In the starting screen, look down for instructions.</p><p>Enjoy your new life!</p><p>P.D: I understand the contraption is a bit difficult to understand, so I made this video, in which I show most of it. I'm a professional surprise spoiler on my free time after all:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIRI6GVTxrk<br/></p><p>Oh!
