Grizzly Adventure is Jadeware's first and most famous platform game complete with over 30 action-packed levels. An evil sorcerer has taken control of Grizzly's forest and driven the creatures completely mad. With the animals under control and the help of a few minions, the sorcerer plans to bring the forest down, but Grizzly's not gonna take it in these woods. Follow Grizzly on his journey through 3 different worlds as he takes on enemies that are out to get him! Goblins, trolls and killer bees will be only some of the many obstacles that will come his way as he tries to reach his quest. Thankfully, mother nature is on his side, and Grizzly can count on a strong ally for food and hidden passageways to trick the beasts. Complete with a groovy soundtrack and some eye-catching graphics, Grizzly is surely the game you have been waiting for to get back to some platform fun!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/300/30019a10a64c1ec187f02899e1a66c57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brizzlyy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
