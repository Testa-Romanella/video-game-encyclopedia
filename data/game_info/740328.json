Some levels have time bonuses if you solve the puzzles in a more complex manner or get to harder locations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What's unique about it?</strong><br/><br/>The game centers around using your powers (gravity-based abilities) to solve puzzles. Most levels have several (if not many many ways) to solve them. (My testers beat levels in ways I never even thought of.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acff068a3058b427dc16429b87b218c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
