This is the very first game I made\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I learned a lot during this game jam including how to shot projectiles and make them interacting with other objects.\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal is: FIRE water balls to break boxes until they hit the target!</p>\n<p>You only have 10 seconds to break all the boxes that block your way to the target! </p>\n<p>THINK FAST!\r\n</p>\n<p>There are three kind of boxes in the game: the paper box, the plastic box, and the metal box. Each box has a different durability (took multiple hits to break) . There is also a cruel setting of this game: If you fail to hit the target, you\u2019d have to start from the beginning.\r\n</p>\n<p>I wish I could add more features in the game including random reward boxes (allow you to upgrade your weapon, freeze time, fire huge bullets to break a lot of boxes at one time, etc.), explosion boxes, moving boxes, and moving targets. But sadly I don\u2019t have enough time to add those features, create more levels, and draw a nice background within the two day period. So I might do an update in the feature to add those things to the game and make it better. If you like this idea, please stay tuned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you like the gameplay and the music.\r\n</p>\n<p>At last, Thank you so much for trying out my game. \u00a0Feedback is highly appreciated!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:46:20", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thanks4AllTheFish"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
