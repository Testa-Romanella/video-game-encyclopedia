My crew left me behind in order to save an important data packet that could help save the galaxy. Now, I am alone and it's up to me to explore this new world and gather the resources I need to fix my ship and find a way back home. <br/></p>\n<p>But I 'm not completely alone, I have my companion drone that always helps me, it can fly and scan the area for resources, help me navigate and defend against hostile creatures, also it can repair my equipment and help me build structures for my survival. <br/></p>\n<p>As I journey through the planet, I might encounter some dangers  but I hope to find also beautiful landscapes and hidden wonders. First scans shows some ruins far away, this could mean there was intelligent life in this planet before, and that could mean I can find what I need for my ship. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope to one day rejoin the Galactic Federation and help in the fight against the terrorists, but first, I must focus on the task at hand: fixing my ship and finding a way back home.
