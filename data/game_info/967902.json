Use an array of advanced weapons to change the course of battles as you intercept bombers, duel fighters, fly under the radar, or unleash the fury of nuclear weapons on enemy formations.<br/><br/>Each aircraft comes with an immersive cockpit featuring a situational awareness HUD, identifying nearby targets and threats. Aircraft can be flown with various controllers or with a mouse-controlled \"virtual joystick\", requiring no special hardware.<br/><br/>Experience realistic flight dynamics, with stalls, spins and g-force effects fully implemented, as each aircraft is composed of up to 50 individually simulated physics parts . A highly detailed damage model means that the condition of each part affects the way your aircraft flies.<br/><br/>Build your own missions using the included mission editor, and then fly your mission solo or with friends in PVP or PVE multiplayer combat.<h3>Flyable Aircraft</h3><br/><br/>CI-22 \"Cricket\" counter-insurgency aircraft<br/><br/><br/>T/A-30 \"Compass\" light attack/trainer aircraft<br/><br/><br/>SAH-46 \"Chicane\" stealth attack helicopter<br/><br/><br/>FS-12 \"Revoker\" air superiority fighter<br/><br/><br/>SFB-81 \"Darkreach\" strike bomber<h3>Features Include:</h3><ul><li> Realistic flight physics, simulated across dozens of aerodynamic surfaces per aircraft<br/></li><li> Detailed damage model with 30-50 detachable parts per aircraft<br/><br/></li><li> Five playable aircraft, each with scenarios highlighting their capabilities<br/></li><li> Player hosted multiplayer with a public lobby browser, supporting cooperative or competitive play<br/></li><li> Targeting HUD and Target view screen in cockpits<br/><br/></li><li> Flight HUD with detailed aircraft parameters including angle of attack, velocity vector, climb rate, G force and radar altitude<br/></li><li> Night missions with night-vision cockpit functionality<br/><br/></li><li> Many guided and unguided weapons, including guns, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, bombs, cruise and ballistic missiles<br/><br/></li><li> A 100km-wide map including various biomes and terrain types<br/></li><li> Countermeasures including IR flares and radar jammer<br/><br/></li><li> Various AI controlled ground vehicles and AI aircraft engaging in large, dynamic battles<br/><br/></li><li> Persistent battlefields with lingering wreckage and smoke<br/><br/></li><li> Accurately simulated blast effects for explosions<br/><br/></li><li> Accurately simulated nuclear weapons with shockwave propagation<br/><br/></li><li> Custom Mission Editor<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-26T18:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c65a7695639629abdad9cfc106f7792.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shockfront Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shockfront Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
