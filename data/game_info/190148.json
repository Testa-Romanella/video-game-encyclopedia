But when they become deadly for the enemy, they also become deadly for you, so be careful and don't hit yourself. When you kill enemies you get money to upgrade your ship to become stronger and be able to kill all 4 bosses.</p>\n<p>If enough people like the game, I will make a full game out of this one.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>(it is recomended to play with a controller)</p>\n<p>(xbox-controller)<br/>go forward: \u00a0A button<br/>steer left/right: left stick<br/>shoot left: LT \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0shoot right: RT</p>\n<p>(keyboard)<br/>go forward: \u00a0W/up arrow<br/>steer left/right: d &amp; a / left &amp; right arrow<br/>shoot left: J \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0shoot right: L</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bd/3bd5b009b2c3ebb7c29764a68f06fb6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quinv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
