My first released Godot game!<br/></p>\n<p>A meteor is fast approaching. You, the chosen one, have no choice but to absorb the elements in the Tower of Fate, and use those powers to change the world.</p>\n<p>... Or at least that's the story behind the game, didn't really have time to add cutscenes or anything.</p>\n<p>This game is a puzzle platformer, where you obtain the power of the elements to solve short puzzles and get to the top. It's not very long, but I hope you enjoy it.<br/></p>\n<p>Wildcards used:</p>\n<ul><li>Traditionalist\u00a0</li><li>HUD-less (only kind of... there's still dialogue boxes and such)</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Direction arrow keys for movement</li><li>Space key to jump</li><li>Z to switch elements</li><li>X to use elements</li><li>C to examine certain objects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:41:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/7741effc4a355db315dd51f046c38b1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ponto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
