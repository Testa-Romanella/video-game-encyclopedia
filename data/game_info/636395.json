{"id": 636395, "slug": "dodge-the-bees", "name": "Dodge The Bees", "name_original": "Dodge The Bees", "description": "<p>In <em>Dodge The Bees,</em> you play as a blue bird. Your goal is to collect fruit to increase your score while dodging bees which if hit will reset your score to zero. The controls for movement are WASD or the arrow keys (the game also supports a controller d-pad and left analog stick). Have fun!</p>\n<p>This is the first game that I have ever made\u00a0(other than simple scratch projects from 7 years ago). I did it using the <em>Godot</em> game engine which I highly recommend if you want to get into game development. The design isn't great and the backend code is sloppy, but I'm still pretty proud of the game for a first attempt and I learned plenty of great things to improve my development skills while making it. Moving forward, I am looking to learn the engine a little more while making some smaller more mechanical/experiemental projects so that the next game I upload will be more complete (adding menus among other things). If you have any questions about how I created certain things in the game, don't hesitate to ask down in the comments.\u00a0With that being said, I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Sprites: Pixel Frog and ssugmi on Itch.io and Jubilee on Twitter</p>\n<p>Audio: Tallbeard Studios and Beep Yeah! on Itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5eb864ce40331d9434b0384d674ffcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SimonTheCookie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
