Wondering, what silly ideas the egp people come up in the future.</p>\n<p>As always it\u00b4s left to say that especially I want to thank the artists whose music titles and sound samples I was allowed to use under diverse Creative Commons licenses. You guys facilitate work of indies<br/>like codemachinery in a significant way!
