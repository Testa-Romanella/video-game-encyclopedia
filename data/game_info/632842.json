This version of the game addresses some issues in the original game related to:<br/><br/>1) Replayability: The original game had replayability in the sense that the code to escape would be different each time, but once you knew where to find each piece of the code, it wasn't really replayable in the sense that there was anything else to find. This version of the game has the pieces of the code hidden in various random spots around the room, meaning you can't take the same path to find the code each time.<br/><br/>2) Environment Quality:\u00a0The original version of the game had a fairly bland environment, so I've aimed to add more to the room in order to make it feel less boring to look at.<br/><br/>3) Animations: A jump animation has been added to the character that you play as, making the character feel a bit more dynamic.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T06:46:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b15db9f6a96875d7fa5524e3d27618f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GarrettHansen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
