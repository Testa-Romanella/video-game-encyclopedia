I've been on this project alone for 3 months and I do it in my spare time, it's my first game being released. I know the game still needs a lot to be something really interesting, but I decided to post it because I needed some feedback so I wouldn't get discouraged. <br/>Any comment, be it a criticism or a compliment, please do, it will be very important to me and I will be very grateful. <br/>Any financial support through donations will also be of great help. <br/>These two things will show that my work is being recognized and that people really liked it. That way I will be motivated to continue. <strong>If you liked it, leave a comment, please, thank you so much! ;D</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game tutorial is in the book on the toolbar (it raises by clicking its handle) when the level starts.
