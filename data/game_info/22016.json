Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.<br />\nHowever, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules. These goddesses prefer living freely and doing as they please, inadvertently causing all sorts of trouble for humans.<br />\nGoddesses who are naughty are called Aragami.<br />\nThe protagonist, Sho Narumi, stumbles upon a goddess who collapses on the street and attempts to help her. Soon enough it is revealed that she&#39;s the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!<br />\n&quot;Rehabilitate the goddess!&quot;<br />\nWait...aren&#39;t goddesses supposed to help humans?<br />\nWith the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess&#39;s rehabilitation begins now!Story BackboneThe story roughly remains the same, there&#39;s just something that&#39;s a little different...<br />\nThis is the tale of an unusual goddess set in a slightly different Japan.<br />\nThe Goddesses Descend!<br />\nIt was a time when people had forgotten their dreams and lost faith.<br />\nThe silhouettes of goddesses revealed themselves to the people who then could only believe in what they saw right in front of them.<br />\nThe confusion surrounding the countless goddesses appearing in Japan could be explained due to Amaterasu Omikami wanting to teach the goddesses about the human world.<br />\nAll of this brought about the implementation of the Divine Education Act.<br />\nConsequently, the goddesses were able to learn, familiarize, and communicate with humans.<br />\nThis cross-cultural exchange between goddesses and humans helped to show the world&#39;s many colors.<br />\nAn Aragami brought down to the world by the Divine Education Act.<br />\nShe&#39;s a naughty goddess who skips school.<br />\nAlthough she possesses the power to manipulate electricity, since she&#39;s an Aragami, she can only make electricity go haywire.<br />\nShe accidentally causes power outages when angry or irritated.<br />\nSince she easily gets angry, she causes power outages almost every day somewhere in town.<br />\nThough she&#39;d like to be in control of her power, things always spiral out of control when she tries to use them.<br />\nThis doesn&#39;t bother her, since she figures it&#39;s only natural for an Aragami, such as herself, to cause messes here and there.<br />\nShe&#39;s stubborn and does what she wants, but it&#39;s not because she won&#39;t listen to instruction, she just doesn&#39;t want to do what she doesn&#39;t understand.<br />\nShe gets a kick out of teasing Sho by trying to seduce him.<br />\nShe also occasionally pulls pranks on Sho and seduces him in front of Maika to make her jealous.<br />\nAn earth goddess dispatched to rehabilitate Akane who keeps causing damage to the town by not following the Divine Education Act.<br />\nThis goddess is serious and focused, but innocent; she doesn&#39;t seem to know a lot about certain things.<br />\nDespite being the local earth goddess, she never acts arrogant, and instead talks politely to everyone.<br />\nShe is charming and elegant, but is also fairly clumsy.<br />\nShe is easy-going, with a docile personality, but brings heavy rainfall to the town when she gets angry.<br />\nAlthough she rarely gets angry, once she does, the damage she inflicts is incomparable to Akane&#39;s.<br />\nShe broods over the fact that she has no prominent advantages over other goddesses, and hates to get mislabeled as a &quot;dirt goddess.&quot;<br />\nBecause of her laid-back personality, she doesn&#39;t really care even if Sho sees her naked.<br />\nShe&#39;d even ask if he&#39;d like to touch her chest.<br />\nSho&#39;s junior, landlady, and close childhood friend.<br />\nShe&#39;s just your average fashionable girl.<br />\nHer looks are stylish and she loves wearing makeup.<br />\nContrary to her appearance, she&#39;s rather diligent and capable.<br />\nShe has feelings for Sho, but can&#39;t find it in her to confess.<br />\nAlthough she works as the apartment landlady with her mother while attending school, she often makes comments about not caring if the old building gets demolished.<br />\nIn actuality, she&#39;s a good kid and is serious about looking over the apartments.<br />\nShe&#39;s tsundere, and wants to continue living there together with Sho.<br />\nSometimes she gets jealous when Akane or Inori gets too friendly with Sho.<br />\nEven though she seems to know about the adult world, she blushes intensely only when Sho sees her underwear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T15:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/580/580ac7073f8ab287d4f37c989121efd3.jpg", "website": "http://moenovel.com/", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 187, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 431, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoeNovel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["MoeNovel"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
