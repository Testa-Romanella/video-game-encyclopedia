The pilot has a very narrow view of his local surrounding while the instructor has a global view of the environment via a radar. The objective of both players is to navigate the pilot to the goal (displayed as a green dot on the instructor's radar). Additionally, the pilot is presented with a puzzle, where they have to move the given shapes into the correct arrangement. The instructor is given a solution manual to the shape puzzle. Both players need to communicate and exchange information to overcome the challenge. If the pilot touches the surrounding terrain or does not complete the puzzle in time, the game ends.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Both the pilot and instructor control the game with only their mouse.</p><p>The pilot has a steering wheel to the bottom left which he can turn with the mouse. Moving the shapes of the puzzle is done by dragging and dropping them with the mouse. Confirming the solution is done by pressing the \"confirm\" button with the mouse. <br/></p><p>The instructor can open the solution manual to the shape puzzle by clicking on the book icon with the label \"puzzle\" and close it by clicking \"x\" in the opened manual.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee357bc3508e8de87ff109f852956a23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaut"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
