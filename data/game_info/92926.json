Designed specifically for 5v5. </li><li>Pursuit - A unique and scalable free for all mode that's a mix of single-flag CTF, racing, freeze tag, and more. </li><li>Challenges - Racing challenges and more, offline and online.

There are bugs, it's not optimized yet, there is only one map and a limited selection of weapons and equipment. What's done now is a foundation that will be expanded upon with your help. Steam Keys will be given later when the game eventually releases on Steam Early Access and <strong>Arms of Telos might require Steam in the future (everyone that owns it on itch.io will get Steam keys)</strong>. </p><p>A limited number of copies are currently available. More will be made available in the future some time after this batch runs out (usually around major updates). You can subscribe to the mailing list to get alerts. <br/></p><p>This game's community is small and there won't always be people online playing 24/7, so I <em>definitely</em> recommend you join our Discord Channel to help find people to play with. </p><p>I also recommend reading this before purchasing. </p><p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>64bit OS</li></ul><p>As I collect more data from users, I'll be able to have more accurate system requirements. </p><p>When you purchase, you'll be given a download for the launcher that will download the client and keep it up to date. You'll also be given a key used to activate your Arms of Telos account. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/54547c82fad0cfdff57e83fef90f53d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Overpowered Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
