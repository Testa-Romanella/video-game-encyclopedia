With the culture festival closing in, she has a chance to change her future but unfortunately, an accident occurs, will she be able to find love in the end? </p><p>Tumblr page: http://princess-s-pets.tumblr.com/</p><p>What the full game will have:<br/>- The ability to choose the MC's name (How cool is that?)<br/>- CG Gallery (Seperate Gallery entry for each character)<br/>- Corner of memories (Special Event told from the POV of the guys and the girl_nvl style, unlocked after you've chose some certain options_yeah this one uses the flag function so you'd better save a lot). It'll be accessible via the Extra section on the main menu. It won't have any effect on your actual gameplay. These little stories will help you understand the feeling of that person at that moment better.<br/>- Secret character route (Unlocked under certain circumstances, uses both the hidden metter and flag function and another mystery function)<br/>- 10 endings (2 for each)</p><p>The current version that's available for download has:<br/>- 25% of the full game<br/>- 2 CG event for each character (1 for the secret character)<br/>- Secret route (First meeting)<br/>- 2 Corner of Memories events. 1 for Naoto and one for Sho.<br/>- GUI and music for the full game.<br/>- Illustrations for the endings.</p><p>Credit: <br/></p><p>-Art, story, program: Me a.k.a toki-aah</p><p>Music: Credit to syncopika from GreenbearMusic under Creative Common 4.0<br/>- Sound effect: Soundjay</p><p>WARNING:<br/>- SOUND EFFECTs MAY CAUSE STARTLE SO YOU SHOULD LOWER IT DOWN FIRST BEFORE PLAYING.<br/>- Silly story<br/>- Sucky background because I don't want to use filtered photograph and I fail hard at backgrounding (There're some out of the place placeholder backgrounds in the demo at the moment but I'll get to it later.</p><p>Thank you for reaching this far. It's my first visual novel ever though so feedback will be very appreciated :<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ad5c894c84f6773d13266cc39f5728a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["toki production"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
