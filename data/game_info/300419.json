The theme was cycles, so I thought it would be cool to make an RPG where every turn, the player's party members and the enemies 'cycle', and only the character in front can act and take damage. I tried to play with this too - different classes can take different actions that let them attak outside of this limit, such as the Ranger being able to shoot an arrow to hit the enemy in back or a higher damage than doing a standard attack up close. While it's definitely not perfect, I'm really happy with what I was able to make in such a short period of time.<br/></p>\n\n<p>WSAD and Arrow Keys to moce</p>\n<p>ESC to Exit</p>\n<p>ENTER to interact/select things on the menu</p>\n<p>C to see the credits<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:41:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa5810654e73d7f79f2419c87535f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SvenBTB"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
