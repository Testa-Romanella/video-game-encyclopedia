Flap to stay airborne. Catch fish as they leap out of the river then fly them into the sky at the top of the screen. If you fall into the river, you lose all the fish that you have caught so far. The sky will gradually darken as the sun sets. At nightfall, the game ends and you can see how many fish you caught (in hexadecimal because I barely know what I'm doing).</p>\r\nOther Information\r\n<p>This game is written in 6502 Assembly Language based on my attempts to follow a variety of tutorials such as this one and these ones.<br/></p>\n<p>Uses Javatari.js wrapper, the in-browser Javascript Atari 2600 emulator by Paulo Peccin.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f4f0ba2f2d9d08c6181811a159e114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clumsywise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
