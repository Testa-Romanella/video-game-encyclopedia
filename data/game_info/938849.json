Sort of like the pixel styled Themesong Takeover video. Grab up to 3 friends, choose your favorite amphibian or calamity girl, and take on the wilds of Amphibia! <br/></p>\n<p>Use quick thinking and sick combos to defeat giant bugs, toad soldiers, frog shaped robots, and whatever else stands in your way. Stop by the local frog village to chat with the locals, spend your hard earned coppers to upgrade your stats/moveset, and practice your skills with the help of one surprisingly sturdy mantis. With 9 levels and 6 playable characters planned, there's plenty to do and see!<br/></p>\r\nThe Demo:\r\n<p>The game is still in production, but a demo is available to play right now! In the demo you can play as Anne or the sibling duo Sprig and Polly. Visit Wartwood, fight your way through 2 (well, one and a half) levels, and face off against the dangerous watersnake. Try it out solo or multiplayer!<br/></p>\r\nMultiplayer:\r\n<p>With the use of third party tools such as <strong>Parsec</strong>, you can play online with friends. Other game streaming services would probably work too, but Parsec is free and has been successfully tested with Calamity Beatdown. <br/>You can download the app here:<br/> Parsec Download<br/>There's also an easy tutorial for setting up and joining groups here:<br/>Tutorial<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks again to everyone who helped make this project a reality! There's a few too many to list here, so please check out the full credits in game.\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T13:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/691/6917cec0473f2718d2f205cd0b63c21d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["krizby"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
