I tested it on a Pixel 4a.\u00a0 There will be a warning that the app is old and doesn't conform to modern permission requirements, but I promise you that the game makes use of no special permissions!</p>\n<p>There is one very nasty known-issue which is a potential crash that can happen especially at the very end of the game.\u00a0 This crash happens at the end of battles on the final map so if you're grinding experience for the final boss, save often!\u00a0 Unfortunately I have also had it crash upon defeating the final boss, robbing you of the congratulatory cutscene.\u00a0 I looked into fixing this bug but it seems like it's more trouble than I can really expend to fix.\u00a0 The final cutscene does work so I pray yours doesn't crash!!</p>\n<p>If you're interested, I open-sourced the project earlier this year.\u00a0 Take a look at some very old java!\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/p4r4digm/bladequest</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d7374e0211fde8536018d7673ee422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["p4r4digm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
