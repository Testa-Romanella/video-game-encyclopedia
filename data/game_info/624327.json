The ideal platform to play it on is definitely the Asus Zephrus Duo, but since there's no touch-screen component in the game, any dual monitor setup should work.</em></p>\n<p><strong>ASCENSION 67</strong></p>\n<p>Cold concrete, killer bots, and a mysterious factory strewn with machine parts\u2014and a voice calling you towards escape? Step into the shadows of <em>ASCENSION 67</em>,\u00a0 a first person stealth game built for two-screen gameplay on the ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The player takes on the role of a robot, who must evade those who want to stop robots from ascending, and must use various sensors to remain undetected and to get to the goal.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ascension 67 uses the Duo\u2019s second touchpad screen to access these sensors\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>Sonar </em>aids the player in detecting nearby enemies\r\n</li><li><em>Compass </em>leads the player to the nearest elevator, to help them get to the next floor\r\n</li><li><em>Contact screen </em>listens to other robot consciousness to help the player find replacement parts\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If the player is damaged by one of the enemy robots, the bottom screen will become visibly damaged, rendering one of the sensor\u2019s useless.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only way to repair themselves, is to find a damaged robot somewhere on that floor and take its parts to replace their own damaged console sensors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our goal for the game was to exploit the tension between looking at two screens\u2014 with neither screen giving you complete information. Additionally, we wanted to play with the idea of the touch screen as a diegetic user interface\u2014 something that would be the same for both the player character in the game, and the player in the real world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/7702c29bf91b08b8dc515b053983161c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dithyramb"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
