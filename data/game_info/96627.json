(Game Jam Version)", "description": "<p>\r\n\tNow with AI\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou man a planet cannon build by man to destroy planets and planet cannons manned by man. Now it's your time to put all your manly math skills to use and calculate the perfect shot through all the gravity or you know just shoot away, something is always gonna hit, pew pew!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe goal is to destroy your opponent's planet before he destroys yours. It shares a good amount of resemblance to the Worms games but because each planet's gravity affects your projectiles it can get real tricky, especially because your projectiles can come back and you might shoot yourself. The game has a wide array of settings that allows you to generate your own solar system as well as play with the physics. \r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMade in the Ludum Dare 38 game jam: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/dots-in-space \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tpew pew \r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t                     .\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a78/a7843dae63fcf675b8fcca7bdcfceacf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toco Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
