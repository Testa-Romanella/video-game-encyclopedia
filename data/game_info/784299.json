With Ursina Engine comes its downside, primarily it being converted to a bat file rather than an exe file. But, in the end its functional and playable for 'everyone'. While I think there are ways for mac users to run .bat files, it isn't originally supported and you would need an addon. For Linux, no clue.</p>\n<em>Controls</em>\r\nA - Move Left\r\nD - Move Right\r\nSpace Bar - Shoot\u00a0Crap\r\n<em>Extra Information</em>\n<p>Because this game is in very early Beta, you can edit the game level by going into the options.json and editing the value</p>\r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"difficulty\": \"easy/med/hard/demonic\"\r\n}\r\n<em>Support</em>\n<p>You don't need to donate anything but if you would like to then the best option (and cheapest)\u00a0would be to subscribe to my channel for more updates on this.\u00a0I plan to make this a lot better, since you know.. it's in beta.</p>\n<p>Channel - https://www.youtube.com/Kxffie</p>\n<p>Discord - https://discord.gg/BYGsrvR95Q</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d436e5684a9a50846de67a4922231f88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kxffie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
