Try to  survive as long as possible, and get as far as you can down this never  ending mountain. Be careful, the slopes get slicker the longer you  survive and further your penguin makes it, so things are bound to get  dicey.\r\n\r\nIf you stumble upon what you think is a bug, please feel free to inform me about it in the comments below. I'm curious if the Mac/Linux versions work or not, HTML and Windows versions were tested successfully.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d1112656d2460badc9450a78f4280373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["KStein"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
