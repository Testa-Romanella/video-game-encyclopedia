De-stress by playing this simulation of wreaking havoc and getting rewarded for it! Need the thrill of getting chased while doing something suuuuuuper illegal? Run and hide from enemy NPCs while breaking things! Want to admire the beauty of chaos? Watch how various objects react to your destruction!</p>\n<p>Join the legendary treasure hunter Hancock as he roams a medieval-like dungeon in search of the all-powerful fragments of an ancient relic, simply known as the Artefact. Good luck not getting caught!</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong>\u00a0:<br/>(In Which, We Explain Why a Bunch of Problematic and Especially Inexperienced Students Decided to Take A Shot in The Fierce Competitive Gaming World):</p>\n<p>We are just but poor humble working students, studying in a games college so that we may have an inkling of an idea in how to survive in the game development world. Competition is fierce, and the gaming world is fiercer. Nobody will care about the things we had to do to get this game out, the blood, sweat and tears we put into making this game, the atrocities we\u2019ve had to perform \u2013 the necessary DEALS we made \u2013 just to publish this game. We are just poor, poor working students trying to get by through fueling the gears of consumerism society using our own blood\u2026</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also pretty passionate about making games and having people enjoy them. Think of us as cooks working at a homeless shelter, just wanting to serve our extraordinarily delicious game only for the sole purpose to receive a smile from you AID-ridden virgins. </p>\n<p><strong>Plans:<br/></strong>We plan to upgrade the game with a huge overhaul in the near future and we need YOUR HELP to do it. If you are impressed with our work so far \u2013 which, of course you are\u2026 right? \u2026Please? \u2013 and you\u2019re a good human being, then don\u2019t hesitate to give our team feedback! Here in Knotgames, we don\u2019t discriminate! We are a diverse cast of characters with all kinds of walks of life - and <em>fetishes</em>. Luckily for us, our game guys, who will be reading your generous feedback, are pure-bred masochists who delight in nothing more than the damaging of their physical and mental state. What I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t hold back with your feedback, because we <em>probably</em> deserve it.</p>\n<p>Who knows? If our game is deemed good enough, with the help of you folks in the updates, we can release The Intrepid Hancock on Steam. Yes, that is our dream, the goal we are working so hard to achieve. We are but boys with a dream, and if you don\u2019t help us, you\u2019ll be crushing it. And where do people go once their dreams are crushed? They take up the drug business.</p>\n<p>So, please. Write us feedback. Don\u2019t let us become drug lords...\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Designers:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/>Zinedine Khairul Azman<br/><br/><strong>Designers</strong>:\u00a0 <br/>Aniketh Gondesi, <br/>Brad Mesina</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Programmers</strong>:\u00a0 <br/>Alwin Joshy, <br/>Aniketh Gondesi<br/><br/><strong>Programmers</strong>:\u00a0 <br/>Juma Abdulla</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Animator</strong>: <br/>Brad Mesina</p>\n<p><strong>Animators</strong>:\u00a0 <br/>Bahar Mohammadi<br/>Syed Irtaza\u00a0<br/>Justin Lemuel Yuan</p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong>: <br/>Alwin Joshy\u00a0<br/>Bahar Mohammadi<br/>Brad Mesina<br/>Syed Irtaza<br/>Justin Lemuel Yuan<br/><br/><strong>Voice Actor</strong>: <br/>Zinedine Khairul Azman</p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong>: <br/>Alwin Joshy<br/>Aniketh Gondesi<br/>Syed Irtaza\u00a0<br/>YouTube Royalty Free Music\u00a0<br/>Zinedine Khairul Azman<br/><br/><strong>Special Thanks</strong>:\u00a0 <br/>Ahmed Abo Bakar,<br/>Ahmed Gamal,<br/>Bing Ratnapala,<br/>Mohammed Fahed Farvardin<br/>Muhammad Hamza<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Scripted by\u00a0Zinedine Khairul Azman<br/>Posted on 30-April-2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad3bf1fccae494b2fed962ae436c26a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlankRip", "Knotgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
