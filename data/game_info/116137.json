It's a quick, fun, arcade game where you control your ship indirectly by playing cards. Each turn takes 5 seconds after which you draw additional cards and can change your orders. The gameplay should go indefinitely allowing you to try and go for the high-scores!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fef2df372649658de9342062c4f7ea41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Moczan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
