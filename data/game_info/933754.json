Fortunately for you there's a teleporter on board and it's powered by cheese, how convenient for a robotic mouse like yourself!\u00a0Unfortunately for you,\u00a0the space station's security systems are online and\u00a0CootsBots patrol the ship. These feline terrors are programmed to do one thing and that's\u00a0destroy you. Can you collect all of the cheese, find the teleporter, and escape with your life? Or will you become cat food for these robotic terrors?</p>\n\n<p>This game was inspired by Space Station Silicon Valley, a personal favorite of mine on the N64. I know it's a bit basic but hopefully some people will find it fun.
