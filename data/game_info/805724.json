Go too fast and you may hit your contact, so aim true and keep practicing to beat your time!</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to do a little experiment this time around to try and get myself more comfortable with my drawing skills. I'm not a good artist whatsoever but I figured I could make something unique to myself if I drew all the sprites by hand. So I did, and it turned out about as janky as one would expect. However, I'll take it as it was a learning experience nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this was my first time recording sound effects myself, however I would like to note that the background ambient audio was not made by me and instead I found it online.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09af04a2fef71755574e21c4669c2a4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RTDMFN"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
