Picking up collectibles makes you slower, heavier. However after testing, adding the dropping on double jump\u00a0mechanic ended up being a lot more fun to play with and level design for.</p>\n<p>I was going to try to make a narrative to go along with the game, but decided to remove the text prompts\u00a0last minute in favour of faster transition as play-testers enjoyed the speed-running aspect more. The poem is below if you're curious!</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>\r\n------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>DevLog</strong>\u00a0: Coming soon on my\u00a0youtube channel.</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soul Jump</strong></p>\n\n<p>Where thoughts are clouds\u00a0<br/>and souls are flames<br/>A young one called Lane,<br/>Was jumping<br/></p>\n<p>She ran fast, swift, quickly:<br/>At the end of the path,<br/>Surely there\u2019d be more<br/>To see...<br/></p>\n<p>Each orb felt heavy<br/>Yet pushed her further<br/>A burden to carry<br/>A lesson to master<br/></p>\n<p>She reached higher<br/>She reached for more<br/>Yet a lifetime later,<br/>All\u2019s the same as before<br/></p>\n<p>Don\u2019t rush, don\u2019t reach<br/>Too much.
