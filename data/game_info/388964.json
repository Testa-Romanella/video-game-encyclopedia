This game is for you!\r\n\r\nHorizons is a multi-player experience allowing 2-6 players to work together as Bridge Officers.

You have the Conn! \r\n\r\nOne copy of the game will server as the Main View Screen (like you see in Star Trek) and allow up to 6 players locally to join from their devices as one of the key Bridge Officers: Captain, Flight, Tactical, Science, Operations, and Engineering.
