Alternatively, ignore the NPCs, skip all the cutscenes and go die in an endless pit. Your call.</p>\n<p>Featuring some quirky platforming mechanics that may take some getting used to. I advice patience and focus. The game does test your reflexes a bit, but it's more about thinking ahead and having good timing.</p>\n<p>If you prefer more traditional platforming, download <strong>PrincessCasual.exe</strong>, and place it in the same place you have the .exe of the normal game. Use this .exe instead of the normal one for an easier experience.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PrincessCasual.exe</strong> offers three new settings:</p>\n<ul><li>Casual Jumping: If set to YES, you can set your jumpmeter power manually via holding the left and right mouse buttons (left increase, right decrease), and it stays put. Then when you tap the jump button, you jump as high as you've set it. Note that holding the jump button still charges a high jump.</li><li>Casual Walljumping: If set to YES, you can walljump <strong>without </strong>having to hug the wall, and thus don't need momentum to walljump. (It's possible that by enabling this you'll be able to reach places you're not supposed to)</li><li>Casual Balance: If set to YES, you never lose your balance.</li></ul>\n<p>Turn them all to YES to make the game as easy as it gets, or to NO to play the normal game, or keep any mechanics you like and throw out any you don't.<br/></p>\n<p>But do give a chance to the original mechanics. The game was designed with them in mind.<br/></p>\n\n<p>And yes, part of the princess's moveset <em>is</em> heavily inspired by the Warioland games... Who <em>doesn't</em> want a princess who fights like Wario?<br/><br/></p>\r\nWarning:\r\n<ul><li>The game is hard, don't expect to finish it overnight</li><li>Don't take it for granted that you'll finish it at all</li><li>Colourful Language</li></ul>\r\nRequirements:\r\n<p>Windows XP or later<br/></p>\n<p>DirectX 8 or later</p>\r\nOr, so I think. This is a one-man, no-budget project... I couldn't test it on many PCs (e.g. I didn't have access to any with x64 versions of windows, but they <em>are</em> supposed to be able to run 32-bit applications)...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29da6a279bd4676046c9ed630b3ede91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Watersilver"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
