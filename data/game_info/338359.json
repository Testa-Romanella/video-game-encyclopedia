It is the code-name.</p>\n<p>The game takes place is a dystopian sci-fi future. The government and major tech companies\u00a0 have joined forces in creating a Socialist Authoritarian alliance to censor, manipulate, and control society.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Individuality is looked down upon and Group Think is praised and rewarded. Technology is used to align thought at the whim of the establishment. Globalist War Hawks are using Eugenics, AI,\u00a0 gene splicing,\u00a0 and genetic engineering to create abominations and push their agenda. There is an attack on the values that have brought the Western world into prominence. That attack is coming from the powers within.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as the resistance. You and your organization have been in the military throughout the transition from once defending of individual freedoms of the citizens; to the current wave of Totalitarianism. You are among the few that have not been brainwashed by Group Think influence of the Government, Media, and Tech. You long for the days of yesteryear and are willing to die to get those freedoms back. Otherwise, what is the point of living such an empty and controlled life.?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong></p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong><em>Player Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Quit Game/Reset/Change Settings:</strong>\u00a0<em>\u00a0Escape ( Menu Will Open)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cycle Camera:</strong>\u00a0<em>Tab</em></p>\n<p><strong>Forward:</strong>\u00a0<em>W</em></p>\n<p><strong>Back:</strong>\u00a0<em>S</em></p>\n<p><strong>Left:</strong>\u00a0<em>A</em></p>\n<p><strong>Right:</strong>\u00a0<em>D</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jump:\u00a0</strong><em>Space</em></p>\n<p><strong>Aim/Look:</strong>\u00a0<em>Mouse</em></p>\n<p><strong>Zoom:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<em>E (toggles on/off)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Night Vision:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<em>V (toggles on/off)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Shoot:</strong>\u00a0<em>Left Mouse Button or Mouse 0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Throw Grenade:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<em>G</em></p>\n<p><strong>Place Mine:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<em>P</em></p>\n<p><strong>Enter/Exit Vehicle:</strong>\u00a0<em>\u00a0T (when in range)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Flashlight:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<em>L (toggles on/off)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Overhead Mini-Map:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><em>M (toggles on/off)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reload:</strong>\u00a0<em>R (only plays animation at this point.
