{"id": 657016, "slug": "2-3-cubes", "name": "2, 3, Cubes!", "name_original": "2, 3, Cubes!", "description": "<p>Originally made for the dimensional game jam, but then I realized that I see a lot of potential in this game that I simply didn't have time to bring to life, so I fully intend to continue development (like, a\u00a0<em>lot</em> of development) on this! Once I'm done with the browser version, I plan to even branch out! Maybe I'll make\u00a0a mobile app, maybe a desktop app, who knows?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>With a keyboard: WASD to move, space to switch dimensions.</p>\n<p>On a touchscreen: go to the \"Controls\" menu in the main menu and select \"Mobile/Touchscreen.\" This will give you an onscreen joystick you can use to move the cube around. With or without this setting enabled, you can tap/click the screen to switch dimensions.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm currently working on gamepad controls. You can move and navigate the menu so far, but dimension switching is a bit of an issue (I may have this fixed by the submission deadline but I have a lot to work on so I can't guarantee it!).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I'm looking for level designers!!!</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>As you can see, there are nowhere near enough levels on here! I'm hoping to have plenty, hopefully of increasing difficulty. Fortunately, I've made a tool that makes it super easy to create new levels, but unfortunately, I'm kind of stuck on ideas. I'm willing to pay up to 5 level designers around 10% apiece (depending on how many levels they actually design--if someone does like 1 level it's not really fair to pay them as much as the other designers, and if they do a ton then 10% is not enough for their valuable contribution!) of profits of the game. This won't be very much at first (since as of right now it's free with no ads or anything), but if we make a really good, quality game, we may be able to actually sell it. Patreon revenue will also be included in this.</p>\n\n<p>To do list here (click the \"code\" button); as you can see I have a lot of plans for this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T01:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebbf7184d4b35b37b706fed1636e10f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raphael"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
