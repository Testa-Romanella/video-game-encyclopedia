It&#39;s a whole new innovative style and since nobody has ever done anything of the like, we&#39;ll name it ourselves, ARPG, which stands for Awesomely Radical Playing... Game, patent pending.<br />\nAll kidding aside, we tried to capture the essence of the games that left a mark on our childhoods, the ones who lit up the spark that made us want to make games of our own.<br />\nThis is a recreation of that experience we had growing up playing obscure NES games, the kind of game that left you with a feeling of accomplishment once you beat it, several months after the initial purchase.<br />\nSet in the early years of the crusades, Infernax is the adventures of a great crusader who returns to his homeland only to find it plagued with unholy magic.<br />\nWhile on your quest to find and destroy the source of this corruption, you will face ruthless creatures, dangerous beast, precarious terrains and pretty unforgiving game-design.<br />\nDangerously open world to explore<br />\nMany secret areas to uncover<br />\nChallenging dungeons and boss battles<br />\nLevel up system to tailor your experience to your liking<br />\nMulti-endings based on player&#39;s decisions.<br />\nBecause it wouldn&#39;t be a Berzerk game without at least SOME blood, we&#39;ve added gallon of bloody bits for you to oogle at.<br />\nBuckle your seatbelt dudes because it&#39;s about to get gory.<br />\nSecrets up the wazoo, so many that we had to implement a Game Wizard to contain them all.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T05:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/38f/38fe875c8621c7f7e7d81209576c1362.jpg", "website": "http://infernax.com", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 129, "beaten": 35, "toplay": 37, "dropped": 13, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 87, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 46, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Berzerk Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Berzerk Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
