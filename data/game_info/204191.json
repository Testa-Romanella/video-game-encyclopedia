At this camp, I have has experiences with kids being\u00a0 irresponsible and stupid and my job as a counselor is to make sure kids don't get hurt. In this game the dangers are made extreme to illustrate the fact that, in the mind of a counselor, if kids escape they might as well have run into a saw. Kids are dumb enough to run straight into a pit of spikes. This game reflects my experience as a counselor have to watch a group of kids.</p>\n\n<p>While making this game, I\u00a0had a ton of fun designing the mechanics. I loved figuring out the way for the player to pick up kids and put them back down. It was a fun challenge that was very rewarding. I disliked the texturing and using substance painter because I am not artistic and I always dislike what I create. I'm still not proud of what my game looks like artisticly</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c8f432b34a57f65ff1a5b4cc62e640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spencerpilarski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
