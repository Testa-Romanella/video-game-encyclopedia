{"id": 516860, "slug": "cooking-with-gas-alpha-demo", "name": "Cooking with Gas [alpha demo]", "name_original": "Cooking with Gas [alpha demo]", "description": "<p>A single player experience where you try to fulfill as many orders as you can in a kitchen that only you are to blame for. After completing the short tutorial you'll be able to design your own kitchen layout then do your best to complete food orders before they expire. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls are included in the game, you can use WASD, arrow keys, or an xbox 360 controller.</p>\n<p>This is based off a pre-alpha I teased 2 months ago. Changes since then:</p>\n<ul><li>Actual graphics, UI, particles, and sounds</li><li>More ingredients, recipes, and final foods</li><li>Lots of QoL and bug fixes</li><li>Redone tutorial</li><li>Added a back room for designing the kitchen</li><li>Better interaction and activity systems</li></ul>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Highlight effect can be seen through UI</li><li>Dish and food storage will rarely show the wrong icons when holding something already (empty your hands to get the correct interaction if this happens)</li><li>Placing furniture/appliances will sometimes give off the \"error\" glow even when they can be placed in a good spot (still works, just has the wrong visual)</li><li>Cooking dishes don't get their \"time til done\" timer saved when moved</li></ul>\n<p>Probable future updates/mechanics:</p>\n<ul><li>A front of house that you can design and take orders from</li><li>Kitchen and front of house decorating, customization (looks/music)</li><li>Saving dish timers when moving them</li><li>Some sort of backroom/inventory system, for managing ingredients between your food crates</li><li>Progression system, where you earn money and can spend it on more furniture, appliances, ingredients, and unlock more recipes</li><li>Limiting the amount of food allowed per dish</li></ul>\n<p>Any ideas, bug reports, or suggested improvements are welcome. If anything felt bad or kept slowing you down let me know! I'd love to make the game as smooth and intuitive as possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bb12e5ba49022e8f275a6f408306149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["comfyfox"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
