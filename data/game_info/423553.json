This game forms one such scenario.</p>\n<p><em>REMOTE</em>\u00a0will be seen alongside a second new piece,\u00a0<em>Theatre of War</em>, for which Annabel acquired and repurposed former signage from Scarborough\u2019s Stephen Joseph Theatre.\r\n</p>\n<p>An interactive maquette of\u00a0<em>REMOTE</em>\u00a0will be on display at Scarborough\u2019s Rotunda Museum.</p>\n<p>Annabel says:\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0grew up in rural Lincolnshire, to the soundtrack of A-10 Tank Buster gunfire at RAF Donna Nook bombing range. From the Cold War to current conflict, Lincolnshire has provided a platform for \u2018intervention\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my new exhibition, rules of engagement, gaming culture, fake news and technology will collide with our preconceptions, our imagination and ultimately our moral code. The\u00a0aim is for it to spark debate.</p>\n<p>Simon Hedges, Head of Curation, Collections and Exhibitions at Scarborough Museums Trust, says: \u00a0\u201cREMOTE is a continuation of the exponential expansion of the \u2018Suffering Arcadia\u2019 series and a further opportunity to both work with Annabel McCourt and further develop our new partnership with Hull University\u2019s \u2018Culture Campus\u2019. McCourt\u2019s work is fresh and of the minute as much as it is an interrogation of humanity\u2019s age-old collective struggle between morality and power, right and wrong, good and evil.\u201d<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>REMOTE</em>\u00a0was made possible by\u00a0St Hugh\u2019s Foundation for the Arts, which awarded Annabel its\u00a0Main Award in 2018.\u00a0The registered charity has made over 100 awards to artists and arts organisations in the City of Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.</p>\n<p>Annabel has teamed up with award-winning Yorkshire companies the Strata Group and Betajester Ltd to realise this ambitious blend of metal fabrication and technology. The game was developed by Dale Wells.</p>\n<p>Annabel McCourt has a diverse portfolio with work ranging from lens-based gritty social-realism, through to installation art, moving image and architectural interventions, inspired by fact, folklore and legend.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>annabelmccourt.com</p><p>Arrow keys or\u00a0WASD for movement, Q for bombs E for gun<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e439d50b4ddbb278dc62d8cc39dbf5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["AnnabelMcCourt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
