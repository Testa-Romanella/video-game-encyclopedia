At the moment the game is kind of empty and dismal but that will change in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please tell me what you think and inform me if you encounter any problems of any kind. This is my very first unity game and I did all the models and coding by my self. All the other credits are to find in the game menu.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, there is not much to tell about the story at the moment (spoiler alert: there isn't any). I planned the story to be a realy generaic scenario. You play a guy that had an accident and now he is in a state between sleep, coma and brain death. So you have to stay alive and try to wake up by force.\r\nI mainly choosed this scenario so I can do what ever I want and don't have to be worried about any part of the game doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p>Oh and ofcourse headphones are most recommend since this game works alot with 3D sounds.</p>\n<p>So enjoy and I'm looking forward to your feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94e283bc281decd89b17b2bbf0581850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["woodychucky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
