Play as Yukan the conqueror, and conquer villages with your army; and help Yukan overcome his fear of failure.\u00a0The game has fighting mechanics, shooting mechanics, army building, simple castle building mechanics, and a magic system. Each time you play slaughter and conquer you will play a different experience as the game will randomly generate enemies each with their own unique attacks and gimmicks. Slaughter and Conquer\u00a0\u00a0does not have a leveling up system for enemies\u00a0but rather a courage system that determines how strong your attacks are. Sometimes harder enemies will spawn on the first few levels. The game takes time to get good at; but you will get better at it eventually.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T13:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd8ab59ff4079c6ba23c176fb0e97bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thevengefulone"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
