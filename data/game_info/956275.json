An update to Trans Folks Walking after a couple more years of development. This beta/demo build has playable versions of levels 1 and 2, though we haven't finished final polishing and organizing for the narratives of both levels. We're also at work on level 3, which is the story of a nonbinary trans person seeking gender-affirming healthcare at a clinic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for following us! Our development is time consuming and taking longer than we hoped mostly because we're all doing this as a side project--an important side project we're passionate about, but with limited time to give to it. Let us know what you think, and stay tuned for the first complete release of Trans Folks Walking Volume 1, containing three complete levels, later this year.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T12:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/5201c943ff868f782e4f6fd09dea1077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cmejeur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
