Yes, we aren't professionals... but we did have fun making the game, in wich J\u00f6rgen an astronaut from earth, travels through realities, with his biggest enemy: Karl the purple alien. We also did all of the assets ourselfs. :)</p>\n<p>It's probably impossible, but please do not steal our game to make money :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T15:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae7812f351b612f3c7036e60ec3c595e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["spaceboyJJ"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
