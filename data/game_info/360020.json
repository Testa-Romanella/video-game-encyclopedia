Solaxi\u2019s axis exists along the surface of this cylinder \u2013 platforms and obstacles only become an issue when they reach this line. If the ground keeps moving underneath him, Solaxi will run along it like he\u2019s on a treadmill. <strong>Space</strong> can be held to charge a jump and glide over and around obstacles.   </p>\n<p>But be careful\u2026 if Solaxi is knocked from this axis, it\u2019s game over!!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jeremy Sapsed \u2013 Development\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ed Roberts \u2013 Development\r\n  </p>\n<p>Benji Thomas \u2013 Visuals\r\n  </p>\n<p>Robert Ashby \u2013 Bits of both + general game direction\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES USED</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io \"Realizer\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)\r\n License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \u2013 edited to play at 50% speed\r\n  </p>\n<p>Portal - https://freesound.org/people/alanmcki/sounds/401324/   </p>\n<p>Charging and Death - https://freesound.org/people/JavierZumer/sounds/257229/ - both cropped from this clip here\r\n  </p>\n<p>Wind - https://opengameart.org/content/strong-wind-blowing   \u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e92c007a14edfc3f846cacf34e2a74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoboPenguin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
