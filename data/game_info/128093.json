Meaning you have to deal with more issues.</p><p>If you mess up and let bacteria or infected cells into the heart it becomes temporarily infected, whilst it is infected all blood entering the heart will cause the disease meter to rise! If the disease meter gets too high, the host will become ill and it's game over!</p><p>Curing infected cells and popping bacteria also generates a bit of charge for the only power-up currently in the game. The white blood cell, once at full charge you can send it into the bloodstream for a while and it will clean up any cells or bacteria it comes across.</p><p>If the game would be completed the idea would be to collect blood as you play which can then be used to buy cosmetic changes, more powerups and upgrades. As well as possibly different levels. There would also be more types of scientifically accurate diseases.</p><p>Currently the game only stores your highest score and is rather short but still a fun past-time. I hope you enjoy! If you have any feedback, please leave it in the comments!</p><p>Development is currently on hold but at some point I might come back and finish it!</p><p><strong>Game and art made by me.<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Music by Teknoaxe - https://www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe</strong></p><p><strong>Title font by p2pnut - http://www.1001fonts.com/rm-ginger-font.html#comme...</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b1b2db9816681ac82674f30761521cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luceira"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
