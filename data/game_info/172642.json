The descriptions for each stage are below.<br/></p>\r\nGames Made Quick 2.5\r\n<p>For Games Made Quick 2.5, I decided to get more work in on an incomplete game. I took a game with only one of its three core mechanics implemented, and got the other two working. It's a match-three, and a spelling game, and something a bit like a maze. Still need to polish.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Left-click two adjacent things to swap them. Make three-in-a-rows of the same shape to clear the shapes.</li><li>Right-click adjacent letters, then press Enter when you've got a full word (or click the \"confirm word\" button), to clear the entire word.</li><li>Click the stick figure and then a chain of shapes (connected by a continuous path) leading to a gold shape to clear all shapes along the path the stick figure takes (and move the stick figure to the gold shape).</li><li>You can also play keyboard-only. Use the arrow keys to navigate, Spacebar instead of left-click, and Alt instead of right-click.</li></ul>\r\nThe files for the  version of the game (currently in-progress) that was worked on during this game jam are named with \"gmq\".<br/>\n<br/>Godot Game Jam\r\n<p>My submission for Godot Game Jam June 2018. First time using the engine. Incomplete.<br/><br/>When the game is complete, the idea is a puzzle game roughly equivalent to gluing together a match-three, something like a word search, and a kiddie-menu maze. Click adjacent tiles to swap them (clear 3-of-a-kind), left-click the tile with the person on it to mark a path (must go to the gold or cover one tile of each kind, clear the tiles the person passes over), right-click tiles to make words (clear all the tiles in the word).</p>\n<p>My planned implementation of the \"temperature\" theme was that repeatedly clearing tiles in one way makes a bar related to that way \"heat up\" based on how many tiles you cleared. Each clear method \"cools down\" over time, and the points for a move are based on <em>average</em> temperature across all three.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish. I got the match-three part working, and there are a few fragments of the other parts (right-clicking highlights but doesn't do anything, and the gold tile and stick figure from the \"maze\" are present but inactive). There's no scoring.</p>\n<p>Also unfortunately, I didn't have time to have it adapt/scale to different canvas sizes, so the bottom row gets cut off in the itch.io page.</p>\n<p>The version of the game that had no work done before the end of this game jam is named with \"ggj\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bbab7a034eed5c68ef74314f9e7c6490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Qwertystop"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
