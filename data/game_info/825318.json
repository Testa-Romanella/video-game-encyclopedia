The first is another story where Tiana picks who she will go to the ball at Kurt\u2019s castle with. The second is the after story, which is the main dish of the game that continues after the first game\u2019s ending for each guy (but before the epilogues). Lastly there are bonus extras for each character called \u201cdiaries\u201d where you get to see cute scenes that happened \u201cduring the last game\u201d and you also get to pet (and now tickle) your favorite furry friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-24T00:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b62cef44025fb36f2b228709bbd203c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Android", "iOS", "PS Vita", "PSP", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Otomate"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Idea Factory", "NTT Solmare", "Otomate"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
