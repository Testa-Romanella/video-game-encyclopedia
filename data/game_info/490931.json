Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you have fun playing. In our house, our standard way to play is with two people on one computer. A grown up relaxes in a chair and controls the base. A child stands and operates the whompers and the cannons. About 15 minutes of whomping every other day or so seems to help chase away some of the current blues. Please let me know what you think of the game, and thanks for whomping!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T12:55:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678e7604d36942e577ac900407cfd015.jpg", "website": "http://www.simplevfx.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["simplevfx"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["simplevfx"], "esrb_rating": null}
