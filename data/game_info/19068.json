And you can also get high scores and stuff if you really lean that way!\t<strong>WARNING </strong><strong>Lots of contrasting bright colors, if you have problems with that stuff maybe don't play it</strong> <strong>Controller Support</strong><strong>The game is fully playable with a controller after setting it up in the initial launcher. It will still need keybord/mouse support to get through the launcher</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d4216bb514216b06300c3dc787d560b.jpg", "website": "https://davideafiandra.itch.io/linedash", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Davide A.
