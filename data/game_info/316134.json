Play against the computer or with a friend.<br/>No Ads, no In-App Purchases.  Just enjoy the games!<br/><br/>Featured Review:<br/>\"Simple, Clean, &amp; Great Fun For All Ages!  <br/>This is a fantastic gem of an app boasting a collection of light strategy games most people have never heard of!  The AI comes with multiple automatic adjusting levels of difficulty (which gets very challenging!) the whole interface is simple, clean, and smooth, and of course the game allows pass and play with a friend!  If you enjoy board games such as checkers and chess but are looking for something more with more unique tastes then this is the app for you!  It is perfect for children and adults and for adults to play with their children! 5 solid stars!  Don't hesitate to purchase this app!  It is easy to tell that it was lovingly handmade; but that is certainly a good thing!  Fantastic job developer!  This is better output then a large majority of the big professional marketing app companies who could really care less about the overall quality of their app as long as it sells well. I've spent hundreds of dollars on App Store games but this app really stands apart!  In short, I am having so much fun with this app and that is what matters most!  I love how the games are themed such as the hunting dogs with the goal of cornering the fox!  It adds great variety and interest to the actual gameplay itself!\"<br/><br/>-- SlyFin  Mar 28, 2015<br/><br/><br/>Strategy Hunt Games<br/>-------------------------<br/>Tigers &amp; Goats<br/>An ambush of tigers tries to eat a herd of goats without gettting trapped.<br/>Also known as Bagh-Chal in Nepal.<br/>Includes:  Tigers &amp; Buffaloes, Tigers &amp; Oxen, Tigers &amp; Leopards, Tigers &amp; Lambs<br/><br/>Fox &amp; Hounds<br/>A pack of dogs try to trap a fox before it reaches the other side.<br/>Also known as Pig and the Fence, Wolf &amp; Sheep, Hounds &amp; Hare, and Devil &amp; Tailors.<br/><br/>Wolf &amp; Goats<br/>A herd of goats try to trap a wolf before it reaches the other side.<br/><br/>Cows &amp; Leopards<br/>A herd of cows tries to trap two leopards before they are eaten.<br/>From southeast Asia, primarily India and Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>Hare &amp; Hounds<br/>Trap the hare.<br/>Dates from the 1300s.<br/><br/>Symmetric Capture Games<br/>----------------------<br/>Four Field Kono<br/>Eliminate or block your opponent.<br/>From Korea.<br/><br/>Alquerque<br/>A bit like 5x5 checkers.<br/>From the Middle East and/or Spain.<br/><br/>American Checkers aka English Naughts<br/>Includes: 6x6 Checkers, 4x4 Checkers<br/><br/>Sixteen Soldiers (2 player mode only)<br/><br/>Fox &amp; Geese Games<br/>---------------------<br/>Variations, based on the ancient Scandinavian game of Halataf.<br/>Fox &amp; 13 Geese<br/>Fox &amp; 15 Geese<br/>Fox &amp; 17 Geese<br/>2 Foxes &amp; 20 Geese<br/><br/>Replacement Games<br/>--------------------<br/>Five Field Kono<br/><br/>4-in-a-row Games<br/>---------------------<br/>Captain's Mistress<br/>Also known as 4-in-a-row.<br/><br/>3-in-a-row Games<br/>---------------------<br/>Tic Tac Toe<br/>Also known as Noughts and Crosses.<br/><br/>Tant Fant<br/>Move 3 pieces to get 3-in-a-row, excluding the starting row.<br/>From Indian.<br/><br/>Shisima<br/>Move 3 pieces to get 3-in-a-row, using the center spot.<br/>From the Tiriki people of Kenya.<br/><br/>Three Mens Morris<br/>Place 3 pieces, then move to get 3-in-a-row, no diagonals.<br/>From Egypt; also known as Luk tsut K'i in ancient China.  <br/><br/>Tapatan<br/>Place 3 pieces, then move to get 3-in-a-row, long diagonals.<br/>From the Philippines.<br/><br/>Picaria<br/>Place 3 pieces, then move to get 3-in-a-row, all diagonals.<br/>From the Zuni pueblo nation in New Mexico.<br/><br/>Nine Holes<br/>Place 3 pieces, then jump anywhere to get 3-in-a-row.<br/>From England.<br/><br/>Achi<br/>Place 4 pieces, then move to get 3-in-a-row.<br/>From Ghana.<br/><br/>Tsoro Yematatu<br/>Place 3 pieces on a pyramid, then move to get 3-in-a-row.<br/>From Zimbabwe<br/><br/>Blockade Games<br/>--------------------<br/>M\u016b T\u014drere<br/>Pong Hau K'i<br/>Grinder<br/>Mlynek<br/>Horseshoe<br/><br/>Solitaire Games<br/>--------------------<br/>Sixteen Puzzle<br/>English Solitaire<br/>French Solitaire<br/>German Solitaire<br/><br/>General Features<br/>----------------------<br/>In 1-player mode, there are 5 difficulty levels.
