In order to get an army you need to build a good <strong>economy </strong>to give your people important things like food and beer. Let your villagers work for you or help them, what ever you like. What kind of ruler are you?  Once you and your people survived long enough and you and your army are leveled up nicely, you can fight back and <strong>destroy enemy spawners and/or the other players</strong> and win the game.<br/><br/>There is a <strong>level editor</strong> in the game so everyone can create custom levels and sare them with other people.<br/><br/>For now it's only awailable for windows because I couldn't test it on other platforms. If I get the opportunity to test it I will release it for other platforms too.<br/><br/>Check out the FREE DEMO if you want to test the game, the demo has no multiplayer and no leveldesigner but you can check out the basics of the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/396c24ee83bf73f1767b10e604164a7e.jpg", "website": "https://www.voxelmrt.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GamingPugsStudios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GamingPugsStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
