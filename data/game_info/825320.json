The 20th century is still young.</p>\n<p>This is a world that experienced a 19th century very different from our own. A world of innumerable steam-powered Engines. The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they&#39;d once known.</p>\n<p>There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the &quot;Great Disappearance&quot; reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets.</p>\n<p>But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe.<br />\nUnbeknownst to her...</p>\n<p>There is a place said to be the city&#39;s &quot;Underground.&quot; This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted. &quot;Underground New York&quot; is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural &quot;sky,&quot; the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist...</p>\n<p>Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the &quot;Messengers.&quot;<br />\nSuffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the &quot;Messengers.&quot;<br />\nThey linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something.</p>\n<p>A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she&#39;s certain of. She doesn&#39;t have a reason. She doesn&#39;t know who or what awaits her. She doesn&#39;t even know why she feels this way. But even so, she&#39;s absolutely certain.</p>\n<p>&quot;Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky.&quot;<br />\n&quot;I have to go there. I&#39;m the only one who can.&quot;</p>\n<p>\u2500The girl sets off for the tower of violet shadow looming far in the distance.<br />\n\u2500With every step, she finds the shades of those yet to fade away.<br />\n\u2500She isn&#39;t aware of the tears she sheds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-24T00:54:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113af68c4007afa9cc3d3c8656394ac6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PSP", "PC"], "developers": ["Liar-soft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer", "Liar Soft"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
