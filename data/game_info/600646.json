Bunch of bugfix,new contents,more hard and fun gameplay,and some graphic polishing awaits you.</p>\n<p>Introductions:</p>\n<p>Move with wasd or arrows,left click to shoot bullets and when you got 7 soul (kill) right click to shoot your skill.</p>\n<p>Unlike the first game,this game have 7 skill instead of 1,and they are:</p>\n<p>-Classic:Shoot a bullet and if it hits an enemy,you destroy it,teleport on its position,and replenish some health and ammo.(It was only way to regen health in first game. But now, you can gain health slowly.)</p>\n<p>-Wall:Shoot a bullet and if it hits an enemy,spawn a wall that blocks enemy and its bullets.But beware,wall only lasts 7 seconds</p>\n<p>-Ghost:You are not affected by walls andbullets for 7 seconds.But beware,enemies still move and shoot your position even you are not affected,so if 7 second passes, be sure you are not in middle of a horde.</p>\n<p>-Dash:Shoot a bullet and you move with it.Its speed is excellent for escaping,but beware:you cant change its direction after shooting it.</p>\n<p>-Invisible:Enemies cannot see and shoot you for 7 seconds. But beware, already shooted bullets still harm you</p>\n<p>-Explosion:Shoot a bullet and if it hits an enemy,creates an explosion.Great way to fight against hordes and getting souls.</p>\n<p>-Bullets:Grants 3 bullet and eliminates bullet consumption for 7 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Q:Why there are so many seven everywhere?</p>\n<p>A:Because first game was a submission for godot wild jam which its theme was seven.</p>\n\n<p>Special Credits:<br/>Music by:Abstraction(Soundcloud)</p>\n<p>Sound effects by: freesoundslibrary.com<br/></p>\n<p>Font by: typodermicfonts.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T11:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc7fdda923efb2c5693cde952c69114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anomma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
