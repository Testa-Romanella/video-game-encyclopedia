They may use their special Instruments (like a whistle) to make us feel brave or friendly in a blink of an eye, but they can only complete their missions if they make us learn how to express virtues by ourselves.<br/><br/>Courage is a Virtue with confidence issues who hasn't completed a single mission in her life, but when she has a fateful encounter with you, a spark of hope begins to light in her heart. Can you help her be a great courage Virtue?<br/><br/><strong>[About this game]</strong><br/>Glisten to your heart is an episodic story-driven game based on the \u201cGlistening Virtues: Courage finds true courage\u201d novel, but with story changes, side stories, new characters and the biggest change of all: you!
