Learn your jailor's story by re-living his glory days and gain his trust faster by embellishing the details if you wish.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome demons are stealthy; others, not so much. Summon a small army, manage them well and control the flow of information across the battlefield to catch keeps and castles unawares and poorly defended. Or, summon a large army and basically only worry about running out of meat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a simulator game. Demons will do whatever they want to do depending on their mood, but they can only rest while in the presence of the one who summoned them. So, where you lead they will eventually follow. Demons are happiest when their bellies are full, their bodies are rested, and it hasn't been too long since their last combat. Let them become angry and suffer the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMade by a single developer in Unity over the course of 3.4+ years and 23,000+ listens of the song Eye of the Tiger by Survivor<br/>\n<br/>\r\nScheduled for Early Access release September 1, 2020<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWatch me dev this game at twitch.tv/user335", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f1b008e5a20d4b3b3a92a8bca8a2dcc.jpg", "website": "http://user335.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bad Cop Worse Cop Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bad Cop Worse Cop Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
