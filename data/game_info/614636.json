Everybody has a different picture in mind when they think about god, but in Casual City,\u00a0<strong>you are god</strong>. Sort of.\u00a0Watch over your costumized procedurally generated city and all the little people that inhabitate your world and simply relax while following them on their daily routines and listening to soothing elevator music. Or burn down some houses. You know, just do god stuff. You got this.</p>\n<p>Your inhabitants will react to your actions, so while setting buildings ablaze might be a fun past-time activity, your people will immediately start putting out fires. After all, they do need places to live and work in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun with your powers, learn your people's bevahiours\u00a0and just enjoy the show!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD or drag left mouse button:\u00a0Move Camera</li><li>Q/E or drag right mouse button:\u00a0Rotate Camera</li><li>R/F or Scrollwheel:\u00a0Zoom</li><li>C:\u00a0Reset Camera</li></ul>\n\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>I\u00a0would love to hear what you think!

Don't be shy, feedback is always welcome :)\r\n</p>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>The villagers find their way to work fine, but most of them just follow a straight path when walking back home so they just magically walk through buildings, foliage, etc.</li><li>In rare cases, villagers fail to put out burning buildings.</li><li>Depending on your PC-specs, it might lag a little during rain.</li></ul>\n\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n<p>This project was a blast to work on. I\u00a0worked together with an amazing friend that I\u00a0study together with. Coming from a stressfull Physics-Simulation (which I\u00a0might upload some time as well, I don't know yet) with less than optimal organization from our university, it was nice to work both as a team and on a more fun project again. I had the privilege to work on this basically twice, the second time alone and\u00a0really just focusing on adding features we didn't have time for in the first run and polishing the game more. This is one of the projects I\u00a0made that I\u00a0can look back to and be happy with the results. I\u00a0might even continue working on this should I find myself with lots of freetime in the future, there's still ton of stuff I would like to add.</p>\n\r\nLegal stuff\r\n<p>All assets in this game are either free to use, already owned by me or made by us.
