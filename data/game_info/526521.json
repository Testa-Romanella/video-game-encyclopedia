I used this opportunity to improve my programming skills. I have never used javascript before and the idea was to make something within two weeks (because I just found this event two weeks before the end of it). I made it without any engine, framework or graphics program, it\u2019s only pure javascript code.\r\nIt\u2019s very simple (and maybe buggy a bit) but this is my very first published game project so I am very proud of it.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is landing on the moon. Two very important rules about the landing.</p>\n<p>-slow down the spaceship, the maximum permitted speed is 1. (<strong>left and right arrows</strong>)</p>\n<p>-keep the angle of the ship between +0.01 and -0.01. (<strong>Z and X buttons</strong>)</p>\n<p>Take care of the fuel amount and the rocks. Good luck, captain!</p>\n\n<p>Here you can find the source code:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/DavidBarta92/MoonLander<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea756a925eb20ca22d800cefddf8cfb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidBarta"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
