The question was basically this - how much of a roguelike could fit inside a one-kilobyte source file?<br/>As it turns out, quite a lot! This game features most of the staples of the genre: randomly generated dungeons, multiple enemy types, items and weapons, line of sight and magic spells (well, a magic spell). It still fits snugly under the 1024-byte limit (actually, it\u2019s exactly at the limit). While everything had to be simplified by necessity, the game manages to be quite fun for a few plays, so I deem the whole experiment a success.\" \u2013 author's description", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a18/a18efb1c5ca159b81df800991cba6fcd.jpg", "website": "https://wasyl.eu/games/another-visit-in-hell.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
