From there, the developer will create several different games (each with a varying genre) for you to complete while they try to find out what went wrong with the original game. So one moment you may be shooting red capsules, but in the next you could be hopping between islands whilst trying not to fall into the void!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Four different types of games within the campaign<br/></li><li> Includes a remaster of the original Duck Simulator<br/></li><li> An original soundtrack<br/></li><li> Completely free</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-25T12:55:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd8c6615f6df03fbc22990ee563d467b.jpg", "website": "https://ducksimulator.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orius Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Orius Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
