Its my first time here and i wanna keep it as simple as possible. Basically you and your friends are trapped in somewhat a facility of some sort. Kinda looks like a factory if you look closer in it. You and your friends must <strong>JOIN TOGETHER</strong> as a team and put your special abilities to the test solving medium or hard puzzles. I'm just gonna make a huge level with checkpoints cause i'm running out of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are controls :</strong></p>\n<p>Left and Right Arrows to move. Up Arrow to jump. Z,X,C,V to switch between characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters :</strong></p>\n<p>Red (Z) Normal Platformer Cube i suppose.</p>\n<p>Blue (X) This guy-I mean girl, can jump pretty high.</p>\n<p>Green (C) This guy's lazy, he's fast but jumps pretty low.</p>\n<p>Yellow (V) This cube is pretty normal, except he falls pretty slow, like gliding i guess.</p>\n<p>The game is unfinished but i will publish to see what people think so far.. If i won the jam or people like this game i might consider finishing it sometime later after the jame ends. Enjoy!!</p>\n<p>- GM637</p>\n<p>PS: Music by Filipo Game Audio (Youtube)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:50:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d6007187b3570ea65f2743e39af96194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GM637Legend"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
