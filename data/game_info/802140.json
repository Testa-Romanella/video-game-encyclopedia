{"id": 802140, "slug": "parachute-22", "name": "Parachute 22", "name_original": "Parachute 22", "description": "<p>Parachute22 -- You're the last line of defense against an army of invading Parachuters.\u00a0 It feels like they won't stop coming, just one helicopter after another each dropping\u00a0paratroopers out to get you.\u00a0 It's ok if a couple paratroopers make it to the ground (you are in a tank turret after all) but once there's a full squad of 4 it's game over.</p>\n<p>This game is designed to reward precision.\u00a0 For each kill you get 2 points, but for each shot fired you lose one point.\u00a0 So if you fire indiscriminately you'll have trouble racking up a high score, but if you bide your time and shoot wisely you might survive long enough to survive the war.\u00a0 Smart shooters will also discover they can get multiple kills with a single shot (e.g. one falling parachuter knocking out others, etc).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything in this game, including the fonts, backgrounds, logos and\u00a0multiple animations was hand drawn by me. If you love it, feel free to over-donate. If you don't, feel free to over-donate to encourage me to get\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>Similar games have been made in the past\u00a0(Parachute for the\u00a0iPod Nano 2nd gen,\u00a0\u00a0others for the Apple II and C64). But\u00a0I never had an iPod and never played it on vintage hardware,\u00a0but I think I captured some of the frenzy and skill of the originals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is for the Panic Playdate game console and can be sideloaded onto your device via USB or via\u00a0play.date/account/sideload or directly loaded onto the Playdate Simulator for playing on your Mac/PC.\u00a0Interested in how this all works? Source code is available too with any purchase\u00a0$4.99 and up.</p>\n<p>Happy hunting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T11:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47b0416ae5525a4b8d44ea184978654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["notpeter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
