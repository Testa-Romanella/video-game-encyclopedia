Paper Hero was made to be presented at a cultural fair at high school in 2014. It was developed in Unity, and I was responsible for all the game development except for the characters drawings.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You, as the hero, must defeat the ghosts and bombs that lurks around the classroom with your powers, while collecting the loot along the way. Walk with <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, and jump with <strong>Spacebar</strong>. Press <strong>Q</strong> and <strong>E</strong>\u00a0to rotate your\u00a0perspective,\u00a0and <strong>F\u00a0</strong>to attack with a fireball.</p>\r\nDevelopment Story\r\n<p>Back in 2014, for the cultural fair that was going to happen at my school, me and my friends, as gamers we were,\u00a0planned to present about the history of the games. With this theme in mind, we thought about creating a\u00a0game to show at it, as it would be fun to watch the visitors playing our game, and surely our awesome\u00a0teachers would like the idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After getting their approval, we then spent six months developing this game, alongside the organization of the booth, with me coding and making the 3D art of the game, another friend making the drawings, and the others giving ideas and playtesting the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Long months after, the presentation day came, and after staying late night fixing the most bugs we could, we got to present it. It was a blast! People were very curious to try it, and even those who didn't had much gaming experience wanted to play (sadly, the rushed player controls weren't helping them pass the first wall jump :P).</p>\n<p>The presentation being over, since no one was willing to continue it, the project ended up there, and it stayed untouched for months. Then, with the release of Unity5, I reopened the project and started tinkering with the new rendering features in it, improving textures to PBR, remodeling some items, and such.</p>\n<p>Since then, from time to time, over the past years, I opened this project to play around and polish it, part because of the nostalgia from making this game back then, and part because I always wanted to continue developing this game, but with bigger things in my life\u00a0taking my time, polishing it was enough for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But since It has been on my HD for so long, I decided after this years\u00a0to at least post it somewhere, so at least someone beside me can have this piece of our past :D</p>\n<p>So thanks for reading/playing and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/2117b572cc80b4f9d9b2afbe0203ce7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KellerMartins"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
