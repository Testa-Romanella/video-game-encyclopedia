Press 'R' to restart.</p>\n<p>Water pressure gauge in the top left, house status in the top right.</p>\n<p>------<br/></p>\n<p>The fire department's budget has been slashed, and it's just you. Thankfully, you just got a brand new completely fireproof suit and hose! You're impervious, so get in there and put out the fire before it overcomes the house. But be careful, the hose pressure is too much for just one guy and will send you flying! It'll damage the house and furniture when it's flailing, and it might throw you into the wall and get you stuck - just fire again and blast yourself free! And on the plus side, the flailing hose can also put out flames...<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, the valve for the hose is broken - once it's on, it'll only turn off when the pressure empties. But then it'll need to recharge. Keep an eye on the gauge in the top left; I'm sure you can handle it.  Try to keep the house intact while you save it!<br/></p>\n<p>Created with GameMaker Studio 2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a1d73fc759c15b94539d512d8532d7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CassidyL", "Xanthos Ware", "SirXmas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
