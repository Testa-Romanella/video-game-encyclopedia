You start in the middle of the apocalyptic storm. You start with nothing, search for weapons and tools in order to build the bridge and make a new apocalypse buddy! A completed game can take up to an hour to finish. When you've reached the end there is still time for some easter egg hunting. <br/><br/><br/>This mode is all about murder, quickly build a bridge before your enemy does, so you can reach the bow and start firing arrows into his face. <br/>Rounds are quick, practice your aim. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is completely free to play, if you want to support us it can be done by buying the DLC which is purely cosmetic. <br/>Your support will be rewarded with a sweet in-game partyhat and you'll be greeted with the power of confetti rain. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f7de7a7748374a6e0f069e082c7244.jpg", "website": "https://FloatyFlatmates.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pelican Party Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pelican Party Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
