Equipped with your trusty grappling hook, throw yourself against the walls and the numerous interactable objects, including acceleration pads and haybales that throw you skyward. Rack up points doing flips and collecting items to earn crowns on each level.\r\n\r\nWe're intending for this game to be a mobile game, but the build on here supports mouse input so you can play it on the web!\u00a0We're hoping to release the game on the Android store soon, so stay tuned for updates on that!
