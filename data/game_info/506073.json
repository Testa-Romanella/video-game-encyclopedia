{"id": 506073, "slug": "mold", "name": "M.O.L.D.", "name_original": "M.O.L.D.", "description": "<p>M.O.L.D. was a project developed by students from Arts &amp; Design and Computer Science departments in 2010 for the classes INF2607 (Animation for Computer and Games) from PUC-Rio's Computer Science grad school and DSG1432 (Computer Graphics and Technology for Games) from PUC-Rio's bachelor in Arts.</p>\n<p>The game was developed in Unity 2.6 and it is a 3D re-imagining of the classic Space Invaders. For the INF2607 class, it was demanded that student modeled and animated characters were loaded into a scene in the Unity engine, while for DSG1432 students should recreate a stage from an 80's classic game. As both classes were using Unity for the first time (and I was watching the design classes as I knew some of the students), we decided to mix the assignments into one project involving students from both departments. So M.O.L.D. was born.</p>\n<p>M.O.L.D. is the name of the player controlled cannon, used to destroy the alien invaders. It's also a recursive acronym for M.O.L.D.'s Our Last Defense.</p>\n<p>This project used a music made by the artist ZhayTee.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity 3D 2.5<br/>Programming: Bruno Ba\u00e8re<br/>Level designer:\u00a0Arthur Protasio<br/>Enemies modeling: Gabriel Lopes<br/>Main character modeling: Bernardo Curvello<br/>Texturing: Leonardo Meireles<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02c4313220be605916f541b37c8d637c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Ba\u00e8re"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
