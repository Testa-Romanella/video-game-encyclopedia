To aid you in your struggle, you will have to enlist the help of one or more of the Mayors. Each Mayor has unique powers which will assist with stemming the unrelenting tide. With these heroes, these demi-gods, in tow, you will have to construct defensive fortifications the likes of which this world has seldom seen before! Chaos has extended its spindly fingers across 29 levels, spanning a multitude of environments! It is up to you to push back the pensioner and zombie laden tide to prevent the rot from spreading.
