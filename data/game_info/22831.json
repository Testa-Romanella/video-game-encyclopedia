The Silencer\u2019s escape pod is picked up by a freighter that is headed to the WEC penitentiary mining facility on the Moon, where political dissidents and Resistance members are held. The mining operation there is the key to destabilizing the entire WEC structure from within, and this is why Chairman Draygan himself is overseeing the program. The Resistance has also managed to install a cell on the Moon and is trying to delay the Di-Corellium extraction as much as possible. All the pieces are in place and it is up to you to make the first move\u2014and the last one.\n<br/><br/>\nCompared to its predecessor, Crusader: No Regret is much more straightforward, and with a higher emphasis on action. This is by no means a bad thing, because sometimes good old-fashioned shotgun diplomacy is the right solution to the problem, and the Silencer is an unquestionable expert in this field.Features the same successful gameplay style as its predecessor.\nDestructible and highly interactive environment that you can use to your advantage.\nGreat music, fast-paced action, and an awesome story that picks up right after first part ends.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8619cdff48dff6fa6d565e83681a379e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.21, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 96, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 467, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Origin Systems"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
