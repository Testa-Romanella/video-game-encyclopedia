It's then that one brave soul comes forth... that is you! And now, using the power of BINGO, you must save the world. <br/><br/>Because moving backgrounds may cause motion sickness or other problems I have provided a non-blinky version, though if you have a particular sensitivity it may be best to give it a pass. <br/><br/>Made using pico-8 from Lexaloffle. <br/><br/>PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS: <br/><br/>- Play BINGO by taking turns with the CPU playing cards from your hand <br/>- You both start with 15hp, and lose at 0 or less <br/>- You have a BINGO BOARD (3x3) and a HAND of 3 cards beneath it <br/>- Play a card from your hand to light up the square on your board or the CPU's <br/>- Cards not on either board go in the DEAD PILE <br/>- if the DEAD PILE fills up (5 cards), whoever played the last card takes 5 damage and a new round starts <br/>- if someone gets a BINGO, they do 5 damage per BINGO plus 1 per card in the DEAD PILE <br/><br/>There are four stages. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b5e87696c6d48048c6bfc48f2efcf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["23"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
