{"id": 401337, "slug": "corridor", "name": "Corridor", "name_original": "Corridor", "description": "<p><strong>Corridor\u00a0</strong>is a simple experimental 3D raycasted FPS in the command console made in roughly two hours in C++</p>\n<p>It's still very basic, and needs a lot of additional work. The system is begging for a simple procedurally generated roguelike treatment, based on how rooms are handled in 2D ASCII arrays. There needs to be enemies, shooting,\u00a0inventory, strafing, and bigger, robust, hopefully procgen maps. I also think a simple lock-and-key system would work well. Honestly the additional work isn't that much, with enemies being the most daunting but still pretty straightforward. Sounds are also pretty daunting and may never be added. Otherwise it just needs a lot of game feel improvements. I'd actually like to make turning less granular and snap to angles for easier traversal.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the game can never be made to run in-browser or really anything but Windows without basically remaking it from scratch anyway. It's pretty land-locked to the Windows command line console, but I'm happy with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/4594d279db24d5c9aeeb5c344e9e6168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
