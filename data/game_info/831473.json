Camellina for the beautiful Rainy Hearts font used in the game. Chris and everyone involved in GB Studio; \u00a0you've totally revitalised the old handheld.</p>\n<p>**A TECHNICAL NOTE ABOUT PSEUDO-RANDOMISATION** The Game Boy isn't really capable of true random number generation. Different solutions\u00a0were considered, and this game uses the Game Boy's frame buffer to spit out functionally random results. This works differently, however, to shuffling a deck of cards, in that the same results can occasionally be repeated one after another. When my results feel less-than-random I like to mash the d-pad around on the Game Boy. It doesn't do anything, but it sure feels good.\u00a0</p>\n<p>VERSIONS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1st August 22 - v1.1 - Minor changes. Slowed down introduction for better readability/accessibility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>24th July 22- v1.0 - All functions of original game implemented. Some questions around pseudo-randomisation, and some additional UX ideas could be developed. I feel this is ready enough to share with the community, though.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T16:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6ce6ad76661fd9e6f782503cf593395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["donotrunwithpixels"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
