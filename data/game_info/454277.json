Upgrades help you get more candy. We were very inspired by the gameplay loop in Emmet's Anamantite Heart (we also recruited him to do a bunch of mapping!)</p>\n<p>Is this a sequel?</p>\n<p>Yep! To this thing here</p>\n<p><strong>Who did what?</strong></p>\n<p>Writing duties were split between Grim and Urg.</p>\n<p>Grim drew all the portrait and cutscene art and the candy and store items, Urg mostly focused on making sprites for the NPCs (though Grim helped out with that a lot too)</p>\n<p>Emett did three great maps for us.</p>\n<p>The sick title screen art is by StrobeHouse over on Twitter and DeviantArt. Don't sleep on checking out his work!</p>\n<p><strong>What is this, a crossover episode?</strong></p>\n<p>It is! Characters from Grim's previous games The True Meaning Of Foodmas and A Gropesmas Story appear to delight and amuse you (and extort you for candy)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00eaf377fdc9c4bb57f94ee9e7a9a50c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UrgUrgUrg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
