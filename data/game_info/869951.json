To do this, you must dress up as him and scare people to spread fear and superstition to increase his power, as well as gathering various items to act as his vessel. Be careful, for if you are seen too clearly, they will realize you're just wearing a costume, and your master will never return.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I had an issue when exporting where the .pck file was too big so I couldn't export for web, and I couldn't figure out how to export for Mac. Also there is an issue where the buttons outside of the main menu don't work. No idea how or when that happened. This was our first Jam and we were low on time, and you you can surely tell after looking at the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T06:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/30727b43e4fd510af6225a22067a18c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["st0reytime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
