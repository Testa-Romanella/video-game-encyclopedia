I stop feeling things, such as\u00a0</p><p>hunger,\u00a0joy, lust, loneliness, hate, pain...</p><p>love.</p><p>I tend to finish the things I start, the things that are expected of me. I tend to do them to the best of my capabilities. So this period of not feeling anything, of shutting myself off, it has to end at some point. Because at some point all the work is done.</p><p>But while I am turned off, I feel blinding apathy. Even if I am making a lot of progress and being productive, it all feels meaningless to me and I don't place any value to all the work I am putting in, nor do I find it rewarding.</p><p>Not being able to feel anything (because you are tired or\u00a0overwhelmed) is like being blind. There could be something incredible around you, but you wouldn't know. There could be something incredible about you, but you wouldn't know.</p><p>I guess I made this game (more of a gesture really) to remind myself that even when I cannot see, I am still moving forward. To be optimistic. I might even be able to see again when all this is done. But it's ok if I can't. I am still moving forward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T03:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/213bb91a5f33da6c9991c9a3d659c1d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["R1G"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
