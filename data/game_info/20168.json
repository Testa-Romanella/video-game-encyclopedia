Embark on a journey full of conspiracies, trickery and secrets where you can never tell a friend from foe.<br/><br/>In the beginning of each game you are assigned one of the 11 readymade characters at random. Each character has their own unique agenda to pursue, as well as a randomized goal to strive for. Fulfilling your objectives might not be as easy as it seems though: as everyone else has their own secrets, some of the people aboard might not be as willing to co-operate as you would like. It is up to you to use your cunning, wits and social skills to get what you want and avoid spilling your own secrets.<br/><br/>The scenarios are always multiplayer and require a minimum of 4 players, which means that every character you see is played by a real person. This also means completing quests always requires freeform chatting and interaction with the other characters. <br/><br/>Velvet Sundown is based on the Dramagame engine developed by the Finnish game developer Tribe Studios Ltd.Key Features<br/><ul><li>The first entertainment title ever to use revolutionary Dramagame mechanics and technology<br/></li><li>Endless replayability: players' actions affect how each scenario plays out, so every session is truly unique<br/></li><li>Uses high-quality text-to-speech technology by Acapela to enhance immersion<br/></li><li>No grinding, no killing, no looting \u2013 just 100% pure role-playing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b6676a15067f63bd1c6bf9eedec559d3.jpg", "website": "http://www.velvetsundown.com/", "rating": 1.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 27, "owned": 696, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tribe Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tribe Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
