The Hounds can only move forward or diagonally (left to right) or vertically (up and down). The Hare can move in any direction.<br/><br/>The Hounds win if they \"trap\" the Hare so that it can no longer move.<br/>The Hare wins if it \"escapes\" (gets to the left of all the Hounds).<br/>If the Hounds cannot succeed in 49 moves, they are considered to be \"stalling\" and the Hare wins.<br/><br/>A mathematician stated that Hare and Hounds \"combines extreme simplicity with extraordinary strategic subtlety\". With perfect play, the game is a win for the hounds.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/7018ba863b4a37424f1aefc6358869f9_7EVICXO.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hendricus Morren"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Hendricus Morren"], "esrb_rating": null}
