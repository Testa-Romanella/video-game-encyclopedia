Can Santa drop off all the presents without being seen, or will he be found by the children?</p>\n<p>Secret Santa is a LAN multiplayer game made in Unity where one player plays as Santa, trying to leave presents at predetermined points in the house. If he manages to put down all the presents, then he wins.\u00a0The other players play as children walking around trying to find him. If they stand close to him for long enough, then Santa is discovered and the children win (and Christmas is cancelled!).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the Yogscast Jingle Jam Game Jam 2020 in 48 hours.</p>Installing\r\n<p>In order to play, Windows and antivirus\u00a0firewalls need to be disabled on port 7777 for each machine (we think).</p>\n<p><strong>[</strong>\u00a0https://www.windowscentral.com/how-open-port-windows-firewall - t<em>his is a tutorial on how to do this\u00a0if you don't have any antivirus software.\u00a0</em><strong>]</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to find out the local IP of the player hosting too: the hosting player is the one that plays as Santa.</p>\n<p><strong>[</strong>\u00a0https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address - <em>this is a\u00a0</em><em>tutorial on how to do this on windows</em><em>.\u00a0</em><strong>]</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Download and run the executable from this page, Windows is required!</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>All players move around with the WASD keys and look around with the mouse. Santa can see all around him (he sees you when you're sleeping), but the children are walking around with torches and can only see just in front of where they are looking.</p>\n<p>You can travel up and down the floors of the house by running up the stairs.</p>\n<p>Players can sprint too by holding shift!</p>\r\nPlaying as Santa\r\n<p>You will see predetermined drop points where you must place the presents. Simply walk on top of these to drop off a present, indicators on the screen show you which direction you need to go in. Try and keep away from the children, if they stand near enough to you, then you will lose! Tip: Santa can also use chimneys to escape! Just run up to them.</p>\r\nPlaying as a Child\r\n<p>The children just need to find Santa, so walk around looking and if you see him, run up and try and stay close to him for as long as you can. Children can also see what direction he is with the onscreen indicator.</p>\n<p>Children also have a sleep meter, this runs down over time and goes down faster\u00a0from sprinting. If it runs out, you will fall asleep (unable to chase Santa around) until you are rested.</p>\r\nCan't Connect?\n<p>Please try the following:</p>\n<ul><li>You might have multiple local IP address depending on your network configuration, try them all!</li><li>Are firewalls disabled on both ends?</li><li>It might be broken, making a networked game in 48 hours is hard with 2 and 2 1/2s men</li></ul>Assets\r\n<p>We created all assets (music, art, animations, etc) in the 48 hours, apart from a tilemap, which we added to and modified.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebd0df331460d1048d38434670a6f145.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ELECTRICALLY CHALLENGED"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
