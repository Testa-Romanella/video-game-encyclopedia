Unlike the original <strong>Doubles Hard</strong> game, diamonds are collected on a three-dimensional board. The player can move up, down, left, right, in and out. There is also 'grab' move. The use of the three-dimensional board has made it possible to design completely new levels that put the game on an even higher complexity level.<br/><br/>The two-dimensional version of <strong>Boulder Dash</strong> has been implemented in a huge number of ways and enjoyed well-deserved popularity. Adding a third dimension increases the level of difficulty, but also the satisfaction of gameplay.<h3>Features of the gameplay:</h3><br/><ul><li>45 levels (and one extra)<br/></li><li>All classic blocks available (diamonds, boulders, grass, lava, enemies, walls)<br/></li><li>A new kind of block: the bomb! <br/></li><li>Keyboard and pad support.<br/></li><li>The first game referring to <strong>Boulder Dash</strong>, played on a three-dimensional board!</li></ul><br/>If you try, there will be chaos on the screen.<br/>But this chaos is under control.<br/>Under Your control!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T14:58:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67ab2df1cdb0096c85653a602de2cbb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Ultimate Games", "Red Dev Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
