Made by two people (That's us!) for their first game jam. All assets were custom-made during the jam. It is a game based on our bonded pair of dogs who are inseparable. You must switch between the two dogs (by pressing E) in order to solve the puzzle to get to the exit door. The dogs cannot stray too far from each other or else they will get scared and must go back. Darkness and light can help or hurt their bravery. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:27:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/46360e119f33a19a360b732fa8af64a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noahssarcastic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
