{"id": 54620, "slug": "comic-party", "name": "Comic Party", "name_original": "Comic Party", "description": "<p>Comic Party (\u3053\u307f\u3063\u304f\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc, Komikku P\u0101t\u012b), sometimes abbreviated to ComiPa, is a romantic adventure and dating sim video game by the Japanese game studio Leaf. It was first released on May 28, 1999 for the PC with adult content, but re-released with it removed for the Dreamcast, PC, and PSP. The main focus of the game is the creation of various d\u014djinshi by the player's character, during which there are varied opportunities to interact with a cast of girls.</p>\n<p>Comic Party is inspired from the real world event of Comiket (Comic Market) held in Tokyo each summer and winter. This is a convention where various artists gather together to share both parody, homage, and original work. Since the series was inspired by Comiket, it comes as no surprise that the \"Comic Party\" convention also takes place in the same building as Comiket, the Tokyo Big Sight convention center near Ariake, Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Comic Party has spawned both a manga (illustrated by Sekihiko Inui) and an anime series since its inception, as well as a Dreamcast version of the original PC game which added a new character (Subaru) and removed the pornographic elements (reverse-ported to Windows, that version is called \"Comic Party DCE\"). Many artbooks, figures, and fan-made homages have been produced for it.</p>\n<p>The anime series was licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International and the Sekihiko Inui's manga is licensed by Tokyopop. Comic Party Anthology Comic, a related manga originally published by Ohzora Publishing, is published by CPM under the title \"Comic Party: Party Time\", which is a series of doujinshi anthologies featuring stories by independent manga artists set in the Comic Party universe. Diverging frequently from Comic Party canon, this offshoot manga series includes more yaoi elements than the original materials. A more recent anime series, Comic Party Revolution, came out in 2003.</p>\n<p>The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as Comic Party Portable on December 29, 2005. Promotional videos show that the Comic Party Revolution character designs are used, rather than the original designs from the PC and Dreamcast games and the first anime series. Characters from Comic Party are featured as partner characters Aquapazza: Aquaplus Dream Match, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus with characters from various Leaf games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Aquaplus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
