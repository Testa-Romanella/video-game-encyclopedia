Search for food, rummage through the dumpsters, scream at people and break what you want. It's your town.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game was made during GMTK Game Jam 2020 for the Out of Control theme\u00a0and will be updated in the future. Our team wants to make this possum's world a playground for you to enjoy.\u00a0<br/>We plan on expanding the town and adding the story and quests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let us know what you think of our game thus far! Donations are not needed, but would be highly appreciated. This is our team's first project and we plan on making it the best we can.</p>\n<p>The assets used are a mix of those from Synty Studios' Polygon City and Town Packs and our own models.
