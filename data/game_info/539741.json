On its surface lies a quiet race of elven-like people, who\u2019s civilization has thrived for centuries. In the heart of its capital city, a once respected alchemist named Drake Voldenar was conducting a series of strange experiments with a highly volatile, immensely powerful source of dark energy. With the fear that his experiments could bring cataclysm to all civilization, Drake was exiled and banished to parts unknown.</p>\n<p>Five years have passed since that fateful day\u2026</p>\n<p>Evil is in the air. A mysterious stone tower has risen from the ground, and an aura of malevolence radiates from its top floor. Hundreds of soldiers have entered the tower to investigate it, none have ever returned.</p>\n<p>From a nearby forest, a lone swordsman named Takemaru Kurumana senses Drake\u2019s evil presence inside the tower. Its malevolent aura is growing quickly, with no signs of stopping. If the dark energy inside the tower is not suppressed, it will consume the world in an event of cataclysmic proportions. As the wielder of the Sword of Divinity, the bane of all corruption, Takemaru knows that he is the only force able to stop the mad alchemist and the dark energy that lies within. He rushes towards the Tower of Turmoil, ready to face any obstacle in his way. It\u2019s his mission to stop Drake Voldenar, destroy the source of the dark energy, and restore peace to Rico-a.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Directional Pad \u2013 Move Takemaru</p>\n<p>Select button \u2013 Warp to previous checkpoint</p>\n<p>Start button \u2013 Starts game, pauses game, and skips cutscene dialogue\r\n  </p>\n<p>B button \u2013 Sword slash attack\r\n  </p>\n<p>A button \u2013 Jump\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Graphics, Programming, Music and SFX - CutterCross</p>\n<p>Programming Assistance: Dale Coop, Jorotroid, MistSonata, Wolfmerrik</p>\n<p>Promotional Art:\u00a0Annissa Torres</p>\n<p>Special Thanks: The New 8bit Heroes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7cc085c646f94f5c130bcd0e20ad7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CutterCross"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
