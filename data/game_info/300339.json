{"id": 300339, "slug": "seasonal-dead", "name": "Seasonal Dead", "name_original": "Seasonal Dead", "description": "<p>(Cheat code: Press period \".\" to auto-win any level.)</p><p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Click on or tab through your units. Give each one an order: Arrow keys or WASD to pick a direction, or space to cancel and remain in place. Then click Start Turn or press Enter and all the units move at the same time. Eliminate all enemy units for Victory. Defeat happens if you run out of units or you decide to Retreat; the game continues either way.</p>\n<p>Axe Mob: Disorganized but dangerous, Axe Mobs fight in all directions (3 front, 2 side, 1 rear).<br/></p>\n<p>Phalanx: The ultimate unit for face-to-face combat, phalanxes take -1 damage from frontal attacks, and deal 3 damage in front. However, they have no attacks nor defenses to the sides or rear.<br/></p>\n<p>Javelineers: Deal 2 damage to enemies in front, and one square past. Note that they can throw over intervening units and there is no friendly fire.<br/></p>\n<p>Chariots: Chariots move two squares in a straight line instead of one. They deal damage based on how far they traveled that turn; just 1 damage to the front if they're immediately blocked, up to three damage to the front if they move through two squares. Chariots also deal side damage; 1 at the end of their first move, 2 at the end of their second; this damage also only happens if they actually move, not if they're blocked.<br/></p>\n<p>Zombies: Zombies fight in all directions (2 front, 1 rear and sides). They gain one hit point at the end of the turn for each unit they damaged (they can even go over their starting hit points).<br/></p>\n<p>Skeletons: Skeletons form bony phalanxes; they lack the heft of their living counterparts (2 damage to front), but carry strong shields (-1 damage from frontal attacks) and tend to stand back up repeatedly (regenerate 1 hit point at the end of every turn, to their starting maximum).<br/></p>\n<p>Banshee: Banshee screams deal one damage to each enemy unit within 2 squares (no friendly fire, a 5x5 area but the corner squares aren't reached).<br/></p>\n<p>Beasts: Packs of undead wolves, bears, and other animals. Beasts move two squares in a straight line and deal 3 damage to the front. Unlike chariots, this damage applies even if they don't move at all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:30:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc762f047269125d52fe26664051724e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyrian"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
