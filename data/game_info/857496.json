Danger lurks in long forgotten ruins, fell creatures skulk in the darkest depths of the wilderness, and everywhere are hidden secrets to tempt adventurous heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Power of the runes</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aether is the very lifeblood of the world of Herezh, infusing the essence of every living creature and flowing like an eldritch river along the ancient leyline that criss-cross the land to pool in nexus points where those initiated into its mysteries may form it into magic.<br/>In their quest to master the living Aether, Sorcerez harness this force to cast spells in battle and craft mighty items of Runic power, which work wonders for their allies or wreak havoc upon the enemies of their Clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Will of the gods</strong></p>\n\n<p>Only the Drouiz can hope to commune with the Gods, struggling to decipher their divine will for the sake of the common folk. Each God is unique, with centers of cultish worship and a mysterious, hidden sanctuary located somewhere in the world of Herezh, where the chosen few may travel to pray for favors or be granted power from their patron deity.<br/>But while the common folk look to the Drouiz to save their souls and guide their spirits, rumors abound of an insidious corruption fast spreading across the lands of Herezh. In the face of this, the normally wise Drouiz are confused and divided - some say this is a sign that the Gods are angry, others that dark forces are moving in secret, plotting in the shadows.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the ancients</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Humankind is not the first race to have called Herezh home, and in the far distant past, the land belonged to a race of beings known only as the Ancients.<br/>All that now remains of this lost civilization are the ruins which they left behind and the legends of their baffling mastery of the Aether.<br/>But in these last remnants of the Ancient's towering achievements lie the source of tales and legends, the promise of their artifacts and secrets just waiting to be found by those reckless enough to explore them.</p>\n\n<p>Herezh's gameplay mixes exploration, combat, survival and management to create a unique and immersive experience for the player.</p>\n<ul><li>Solo and multiplayer (PvP &amp; PvE)<br/>\n</li><li>Huge procedurally generated map<br/>\n</li><li>Class-less RPG progression without level cap<br/>\n</li><li>Deep crafting system<br/>\n</li><li>Rogue-lite generational system<br/>\n</li><li>Settlement &amp; NPC managment<br/>\n</li><li>Immersive survival gameplay\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Explore</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Roam freely around a procedurally generated map with seven distinctly different and visually stunning Biomes, each with individual, hand-crafted locations known as Wonders waiting to be discovered.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use melee and ranged weapons, magic or any combination of all three to defeat everything from the smallest of critters to the largest of world bosses.<br/>But be aware that in the world of Herezh, each of these three types of combat are very different, requiring unique approaches and changing the feel of the gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Survive</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The world of Herezh is a dangerous one, filled with not only monsters thirsting for your blood, but all the challenges of nature as well.<br/>Players will need to hunt, fish and find water, seek shelter and protection from the wrath of the open skies.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft, build, grow and tame</strong></p>\n\n<p>Herezh boasts a deep and intricate crafting system, with eight specialties and literally hundreds of craftable items, all of which will help you master the environment.Craft and grow the things that you need, tame the wild creatures that you meet - even the mighty World Bosses - and make your mark on the world by building entire towns to shelter your Clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Conquer</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Claim land and territories for yourself and your Clan, and then use these to bolster and protect your settlements, as well as the subjects inside them.<br/>By claiming territories in this way, they become protected from offline raids and are more resilient to damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Lead</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Create, customize and manage your own settlement, populated by members of your Clan and a cast of NPC subjects.<br/>These subject will then go about their daily lives, collecting resources and crafting items on your behalf, leaving you free to stop worrying about collecting low-level resources and instead deal with high-level adventure.<br/>You can even take the soldiers defending your settlement into battle!<br/><br/><br/>Your characters (yes plural!) build a lineage of heroes fighting for the world of Herezh and establish long lasting relationships with other Player and Non-Player Characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Customization</strong><br/><br/><br/>Herezh use an in-depth character creation tool, allowing you to give your character a truly unique appearance, with over fifty variables for face and body type, as well as over one hundred different facial hair and hairstyle choices.</p>\n<p><strong>Progress<br/><br/></strong><br/>Build the character YOU want with very little limits, no class, no hard level caps, 15+ skills and 200+ perks.</p>\n<p><strong>Marry and build a legacy<br/></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Choose a partner for your character, raise their offspring and ensure the best possible beginnings for the next character to carry on the lineage.</p>\n<p><strong>Age and die<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The saga unfolding in Herezh is one of epic proportions, and will last longer than the lifetime of one hero alone.<br/>Your character will grow in age, as well as in experience and power, eventually growing old and dying.
