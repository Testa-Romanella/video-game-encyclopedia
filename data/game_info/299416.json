For one to four players,\u00a0boasts a casual pick-up-and-play focus with a low barrier to entry!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by rollercoaster action chase films,\u00a0classic arcade titles of the 1990s\u00a0and modern\u00a0Battle Royale games, Snowdown is also planned to have a more relaxed approach to traditional concepts of\u00a0game flow and is thereby intended to\u00a0compliment a more idle brand of party atmosphere, allowing players the freedom to step back and let a session play out by itself and come back to it later on if they so choose.</p>\n<p>Plans beyond this early test build include environmental obstacles, player-activated hazards, custom tube selection on the ready-up screen and broader polish in terms of art style and level design.
