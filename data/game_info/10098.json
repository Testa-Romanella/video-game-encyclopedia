He lost all of his limbs  somehow, and has no idea of what happened. He is a little bit crazy, but he can communicate with you.. You don't have much clue of what to do either, but since you are a little bit smarter than Bob, you are in charge. <br/><br/>At the start of the game, Bob's battery is now nearly empty. Coincidentally there is battery pack  just up the road ahead. If he goes and gets it himself, he will trip over and fall down the pit. Your first task is to look at the path and send him instructions on how to get there.<br/>Bob is very happy you are going on this adventure with him because you will help him find his lost limbs which are currently scattered around, and also plenty of oil tins . You are admired for your ingenuity in guiding Bob through this difficult journey.<br/><br/><br/>Not everything will be easy-going though. Bob will find himself in challenging situations and you both will need to work hard for him to get back.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T09:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12dcde516d2886391c50d9b993ffc91a.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/JumpStepStep/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 30, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Thang Phung Dinh", "Dzung Phung Dinh", "Phung Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hidden Trap", "Thang Phung Dinh", "Dzung Phung Dinh", "Phung Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
