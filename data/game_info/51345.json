{"id": 51345, "slug": "inline", "name": "Inline", "name_original": "Inline", "description": "In Inline, your goal is to arrange random shapes on a grid so that they form unbroken lines, which are then cleared. The more lines you clear, the harder the game becomes as shapes get increasingly large and difficult to position right. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Luckily, you are given the ability to a few shapes every now and then; the more shapes you place and the more lines you make, the more you can skip in return. Completing multiple lines with a single shape or with consecutive moves grant bonus points and recharge your skips faster, which rewards planning over mindless actions.<br/><br/>Tired of the regular grid and shapes? Customize your own experience by playing with the various settings of custom mode. Start at a higher level, limit the maximum difficulty, increase the number of skips you can accumulate, make the grid larger or smaller to your taste. You can even alter the frequency of every single shape type in the game, or use the preexisting difficulty settings to create a more relaxed or more challenging experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970277672de16c5497961c8db6895253.jpg", "website": "http://lightbringergames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 36, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Light Bringer Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Light Bringer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
