Furthermore, we also thought it would be a neat idea to make the Turtle a robot that has the wind up design.<br/><br/>Post Mortem:</p>\n<p>If we had more time and energy we would have ideally liked to have taken this idea further by creating more levels with more features such as ropes that you can pull to lift objects, or a crank to turn a conveyor. Including these would have given the game more depth and would allow for more varied level design.<br/></p><p>Maybe one day we'll come back to it to polish and refine it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d952906adf815f719ed73cf44a38876b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jacob Gibbins"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
