The rocket ship left the earth for its long journey to Mars, but on the way, a time-hole sucked it in and transferred it to an alien planet. Upon landing, the rocket blew away various essential celebratory items of the inhabitant aliens and scared away the sacred bird. Now, humans, the player, have to use their emissary-robot and make up for all the accidents, by completing various tasks to help restore the festival and bring back the sacred bird.</p>\n<p>Game Design Document (GDD): Provided above</p>\n<p>Gameplay Video:\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the University of South Wales, in association with Tiny Rebel Games.
