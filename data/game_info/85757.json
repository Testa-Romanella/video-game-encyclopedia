That's it!  The more shapes you collect, the more points you get. Yellow shapes give you a bonus and multiply your points, but watch out for red shapes!  Purple shapes are POWER!  You'll have to discover on your own what the pulsing color shapes do...<br/> <br/>Music Catch (version 1.0.1) includes four relaxing songs from Isaac Shepard's solo-piano albums:<br/> <br/>* \"Before Dawn\" from \"Swept Away\"<br/>* \"Leaves in the Wind\" from \"Deep Joy\"<br/>* \"Gentle\" from \"Deep Joy\"<br/>* \"Letting Go\" from \"Deep Joy\"<br/> <br/>************<br/> <br/>ADVANCED TIP: Want an extra challenge, or would you like to play co-op with a friend?

Although OS3 will allow games to play music from your iPhone, we are unaware of any way that it will allow games to analyze the music data. For these reasons, Music Catch is unable to use your iPhone music during the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55c945b0de22605d712eeb73569dd5a2.jpg", "website": "http://www.musiccatchgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lemon Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Lemon Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
