{"id": 483873, "slug": "fuchsia", "name": "Fuchsia", "name_original": "Fuchsia", "description": "<p><em>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/HambugGames</em></p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/hambuggames</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Fuchsia is a strange and comedic point-and-click puzzle adventure, with witty dialogue and an intriguing story. Discover the grand mystery behind the strange island that you wake up on. The island's great secret isn't a smoke monster or an ancient fraternal rivalry, but it may just blow your socks off.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Along the way of our character's journey, you'll hear his whole catalog of obnoxiously pun-tastic whit, which is certainly not juxtaposed to the atmosphere of the island. Fuchsia uses its unique music and art style to create an atmosphere not only of mystery and intrigue, but also of hilarity and absurdity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game's puzzles, just like the atmosphere, exude uniqueness. While they will, no doubt, at times leave the player thinking long and hard, the puzzles are always fair and sensible. They are easy enough for any player to be capable of solving them with enough time, yet difficult enough for every player to feel satisfied at every point of progression.</p>\n<p>Fuchsia takes place in three distinct sections (or \"chapters\"), and takes approximately one to two hours to complete. Completion time will, of course, vary based on how long the player takes to solve each puzzle.</p>\n<p>This is our first game\u00a0<em>ever</em>, so we really hope you enjoy it! Thank you so much to everyone who plays it!<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong><em>Find yourself stuck on a puzzle?\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Check out this walkthrough of Fuchsia on our website:\u00a0<br/></strong>https://hambuggames.wixsite.com/fuchsiagame/walkthrough<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><em>Programming/Design</em></p>\n<ul><li>Simon Ward - lead developer</li></ul>\n<p><em>Art</em></p>\n<ul><li>Simon Ward - lead artist</li><li>Charlotte Ward - secondary artist</li></ul>\n<p><em>Puzzle Design</em></p>\n<ul><li>Charlotte Ward - lead puzzle designer</li><li>Simon Ward - secondary puzzle designer</li></ul>\n<p><em>Music/Sound Design</em></p>\n<ul><li>Simon Ward - lead composer</li><li>James Ward - song contributor</li><li>John Ward - song contributor</li><li>Zapsplat.com - sound effects provider\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><em>Voice Acting</em></p>\n<ul><li>Caleb Sanders - lead role</li><li>Simon Ward - other characters</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/85103540607f734eb2ef22183bae79b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hambug Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
