If it was played at all. It's had various incarnations over the years, on everything through the PET, Vic, ZX81, Speccy and beyond. At its core it's a really simple game, being entirely controlled by two buttons; in this implementation we've extended it into what you might call a \"dexterity puzzle\" style of game, as you have to work out what to do on each level and then guide the ball accordingly.</p>\n<p>Deflex originally came about as a modification to the PET game \"Target Pong\", from 1978.</p>\n\r\n\"Target PONG\", Commodore PET, 1978\r\n<p>The objective was to deflect a ball into a target (represented by the hollow circle)\u00a0 by placing deflectors in its path - / and \\ - each of which deflected its path by 90 degrees in a direction determined by the ball's current direction. If you look at the PET's keyboard, specifically the N and M keys, you'll see the symbols for the two deflectors there; those two keys became the game's control buttons.</p>\n\r\nThe N and M buttons placed the two deflectors.\r\n<p>Us nerds at 6th form liked this game, but found that very quickly the ball became locked in short repeating paths rather quickly. So we added a modification such that every time the ball bounced off a deflector, as well as altering the ball's trajectory, the deflector would also \"flip\" into its opposite state, / becoming \\ and vice versa. This led to much more interesting trajectories without the possibility of being locked into short loops. This variant became \"Deflex\".</p>\n<p>In the version presented here the core gameplay is the same, with the / and \\ deflectors being placed by using the left and right mouse buttons respectively. I added a time limit and a succession of levels with variations such as walls as obstacles, moving targets, targets that need hit in a particular order and suchlike, to provide a bit of variation on the extremely basic gameplay.</p>\n\r\nOn this level you must hit the Welsh flags in a specific order.\r\n<p>Hitting a target out of sequence results in a Clumsy Donkey Error and loss of a life.</p>\n\r\nHere you must eliminate a herd of Queen Mothers which skitter about trying to avoid your balls.\r\n<p>Hitting a target extends the time limit and allows extended play.</p>\n\r\nOn this level you must hit the goat plushies whilst avoiding the sheepie plushies.\r\n<p>As usual there is an unnecessarily verbose page explaining the gameplay strategies here.</p>\n<p>Like the other two games from that era I've put up, this is dead simple stuff and should hopefully run without issue even on a modern windows system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01ae73f1bbe0aea12205b5b91811ea51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llamasoft_ox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
