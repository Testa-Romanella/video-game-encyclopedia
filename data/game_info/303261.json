The idea for having eyes as the main threat just happened as I experimented with sprite designs. Flexalot was also a construction of random sprite experimentation. The game\u2019s story is a hero adapting to unfamiliar territory and facing evil all so he can return home. Through interacting with various characters, you get more detail about yourself and what kind of world you are in. I simply wanted to create a fun waste of time for the person with a minute or two.</p>\n<p>I am most proud of the personalities given to each Eye. \u00a0Every Eye\u2019s dialogue no matter how brief does make me laugh. There aren't enough eye puns in the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b83/b839c5622a24ccedaddb94039ab090a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsy bitsy spider"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
