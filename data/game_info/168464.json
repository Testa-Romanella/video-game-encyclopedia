It's kind a parody of other games of this type. But its unique because it has abilities and its moderately hard! :)</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>A for left</p>\n<p>D for right</p>\n<p>E for back in time (It goes few seconds back in time)</p>\n<p>F for slow mode (time moves slower)</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately there are some.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In-game audio options are bugged - they dont work properly. So i advise you to turn down/off audio in audio mixer in windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes when you pick level from level picker level won't start, to fix that issue you can click ESC or P to pause again and again ESC or\u00a0P or resume to resume the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry for any\u00a0inconvinience I will look into that!</p>\n\n<p>PS. Game is totaly free and there is no ads, simply because its just funny little game.</p>\n<p>Feel free to rate, post comments or/and questions!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d0ecc13469853eede74377121865e93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheElfLord"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
