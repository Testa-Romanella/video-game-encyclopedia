I really wanted to create easy, but intense combat experience. his game would be perfect if you want to \"relax\" and shoot some bad guys for a 15 minutes or so while waiting for your AAA-blockbuster to download. But if you a hardcore gamer, you will be lost in this game. Fight for high score, unlock every upgrade, reveal each hidden mechanic and be the very best. I really hope you will like this game!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T03:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54c1886ab33d6cd84e6616e060e8976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Grade"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex Grade"], "esrb_rating": null}
