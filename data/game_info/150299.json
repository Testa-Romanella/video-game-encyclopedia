I really like the idea of combining a exploration/puzzle IF game with an RPG-style group of party members who each bring a new capability to the table.</p><p>If I ever continue this, I know there's more to be done to bring the NPCs to convincing life, on top of building more puzzles and coming up with a good ending. Right now you can meet three party members (I include Scrap, of course) and gather two jewels. Please give it a shot and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435fec5ae458281f286cc907ac4b9cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Celia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
