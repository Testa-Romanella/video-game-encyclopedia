This game specifically is going to contain elements similar to Pokemon, the Legend of Zelda series, and Stardew Valley. I plan on adding five towns with respective subareas, as well as a city that you yourself can *sort of* customize. This is all a work and progress, and the current build has taken me a year and a half to complete (due to various hiatuses/hiati?). Hope you enjoy this as much as I did when I first tried out the gameboy a year and a half ago, as that was the spark that started my journey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:41:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/9998b7a00ec7937b45c6fb25817aaa7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheCasualWendigo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
