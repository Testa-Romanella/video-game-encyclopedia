Welcome to the topic of my game, Eletrion ReAlpha, before explaining better about the game I need to talk about what is the Atompunk genre, because a good part of the ReAlpha universes are Atompunk. Atompunk is a sub-genre of the science fiction that portrays a past where present and future technologies happened earlier, but then you think \u201cOh, but that\u2019s not called Atompunk, it\u2019s called Steampunk\u201d not exactly. While Steampunk is set in the XIX century, the Atompunk is set in the middle of the XX century (1945 \u2013 1965). A good game that exemplifies what is Atompunk is\u00a0Fallout 4.
