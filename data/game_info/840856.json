Explore different worlds and boundless, unique cities and settlements.<br/>Wage wars against fellow villages and players, with a unique, versatile combat system and hundreds of different armor types, weapons, and machines. quickly progress to higher levels, crawl through dungeons alone or with friends, and come to fight the biggest bosses in the multiverse. And when you're done with your items, craft your ones, and create unique and personal weapons and armor, to better conquer the worlds.<br/>With your planet, towers, armor weapons, and friends, the multiverse is yours to explore.<br/><br/><br/>In Multiworld, you'll never have two weapons that work the same; one sword might have flames that wrap around your enemy, and another might create a huge wave of water that will drown your enemy. There is a great selection of weapons to choose from, such as Swords, Axes, Daggers, Bows, Maces, Spears and so much more. And not only will you have super cool abilities with each weapon, but they're much easier to get than in other games! Instead of grinding for hours to get a sword slightly better than your current one, you're able to find a next-level weapon or upgrade your current one in minutes!<br/><br/><br/>Multiworld has many items that you will find as you venture across the land. Each one has its own function; maybe it can be crafted to make something like a saddle, or maybe you can place it to make a nice addition to your home.<h3>Worlds</h3>Now for the main feature of Multiworld, the worlds! From the very start of the game you travel to a new planet, and each planet is different.You have your very own home planet, where you can build a nice cosy cabin to live in, or maybe you're more of a theme park person! On some planets there are villages and cities, which you can explore or raid! But beware, the further you go, the more advanced the civilizations are. Finally, there are dungeons that you can venture across with your friends. Each dungeon is randomly generated and has puzzles and great loot!<br/><br/>There is a lot more to Multiworld, but you will need to find out about that yourself!<br/><br/>Main Description by Neonforpencils", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T04:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b07909bfda7261d31f82ea9f08ac05c.jpg", "website": "https://supereo.dev", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supereo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Supereo"], "esrb_rating": null}
