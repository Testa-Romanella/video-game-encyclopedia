Go skiing of course. But watch out, this slope goes over a busy motorway!</p>\n<p>A very simple game based on a classic ZX Spectrum game from the early 80's.</p>\n<p>Whilst inspired by an older game, this version is sufficiently different with different controls and some gameplay tweaks.</p>\n<p>This was my first full game on the ZX Spectrum 48k. It is a little rough and ready, and non-definable keys are fixed to WASD (sorry!). Full instructions for controls are built into the game.</p>\n<p>Source code is available on my Github. Live coding for ZX Spectrum most nights on my Twitch channel.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e22/e225a9969d628eec9c82a1c2eb7aef9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroCoder TV"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
