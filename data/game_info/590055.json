Each of them failed in the profession they\u2019d chosen, shunned by those closest to them. Wishing to prove their worth others, especially to their own selves, the girls set forward on a dangerous adventure. Thus begins the story of their journey. You will not find neither chosen ones fated to win nor the ever-present isekai heroes from the other worlds. This is a story about those striving to make themselves through struggles companionship and witty banter!<br/><br/>Heroines of Swords &amp; Spells is more than just a game. It\u2019s a whole book that will appeal to the old school RPG lovers: more than 150 thousand lines of dialogues and no less than 15 hours of gameplay. Heroines of Swords &amp; Spells is an epic fantasy JRPG journey! If you enjoy reading and exploring the detailed world, you\u2019ll surely love this game. Especially if you fancy humorous fantasy.<br/><br/>Heroines of Swords &amp; Spells is mostly about interacting with NPCs and having fun, but the players will have their share of troublesome battles. Countless enemies will make you think of the best tactics, the dungeons are full of ambushes and traps. You will lead a party of four:<br/><br/>\u2022 a naive thief, always ready to give away the shirt off her back;<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022 a hyperactive mage with an empty spellbook;<br/><br/><br/>\u2022 a cowardly warrior from a noble family;<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 a beautiful priest whose prayer is just a teeny-tiny bit weak\u2026 ish.<br/><br/><br/>Those ready to lead the dream team should expect:<br/>1. Suspenseful humorous plot with tons of dialogues, books and world lore.<br/>2. A battle system with no equipment farming, no auto-leveling enemies and no random encounters (yes, we also hate those).<br/>3. Intricated locations with non-linear quest system.<br/>4. Tons of equipment including four legendary combination artifacts.<br/>5. A multitude of Easter eggs and takeoffs on the good games of old.<br/><br/>Good luck to everyone who decides to play this game. May merciful Svetodar help you!</p>\n<p><strong>With the 1.5 update introduced, the demo now contains Act I (full version), except for the\u00a0Green Furies DLC.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Heroines of Swords &amp; Spells demo is also available on Steam, but buying the game will give you access to achievements, cards and other community items, and also will be of great help to me.</p>\n<p>The DLC includes a separate game scenario about the four evil, greedy, but cute (in their own way) goblinettes. An 'anti-heroic' team of rival protagonists.<br/><br/>The Green Furies scenario should take around 7+ hours to finish. As with the main campaign, the main emphasis in the DLC is on the story, jokes and dialogues. The player will have to read a lot and, of course, understand what is written.<br/>Anyone who decides to go down the wrong path of anti-heroism with the goblinettes should expect:<br/>1. Four new playable characters, each with unique personality traits that affect gameplay;<br/>2. New story and side quests with a variety of playthrough options;<br/>3. A small but ready to be explored goblin cave;<br/>4. Engaging bosses and some original equipment.<br/><br/>I have to note that the DLC scenario is designed for experienced players who are familiar with the story of the main campaign, the world lore and gameplay mechanics. If you haven't played Heroines of Swords &amp; Spells, rushing to buy Green Furies DLC may not be the best decision as far as I'm concerned, but it\u2019s still up to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:00:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad1/ad1a8c9ca88278f775c05d453529b58a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirillkrm"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
