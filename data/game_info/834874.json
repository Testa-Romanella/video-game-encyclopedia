(sound is important)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T15:55:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f226ea0c4cb6d364385614d6eb218a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CrabRabbit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
