Build the ultimate mech and destroy your friends!</li><li>Draft mode:\u00a0Every player starts with a \u201chand\u201d (like in card games) of components: each player picks one and pass his/her hand to the next player, and so on until hands are emptied. When the draft is finished they can build their mech, but only with the pieces they took from the draft! If the player didn\u2019t have a component for a certain category, he/she\u2019ll receive a random one.</li><li>OnePunch Mechs:\u00a0this mode is for fast and fun matches: everyone has the same pre-built mech, \u201cThe Punisher\u201d: it\u2019s the smallest mech with components which allow it to fly and go faster and as weapon the \u201cPunch-o-Matic 3000!\u201d, a mechanical boxing glove which pushes enemy very far! If you get punched once, you\u2019ll fly off the stage: every hit can be deadly!\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Each component can do different things:</p><ul><li>Bodies\u00a0determine your hitbox, your main weight, your health. They come in different sizes and shapes: smaller is lighter but with less health, and vice versa.</li><li>Weapons\u00a0determines your main attack options: range, rate of fire, damage and push force. Remember, you can destroy opponents also by throwing them off stage!</li><li>Wheels\u00a0determine your type of movement: wheels to move and jump, a pogo to keep jumping and reach higher places, an ufo to fly (recharge on ground!) and\u2026 A 2000KG cursed mayan shrine?</li><li>Toppers\u00a0are activable item placed on top of your mech. They have a cooldown, if they are active, or activate by themselves if passive. They can do various things: throw 3 missiles, propel you upwards even in mid-air, shield you from damage, slow down your fall or even attract a dangerous lightning!</li><li>Gimmicks\u00a0are like toppers, and do miscellaneous things: drop bouncing bombs or deadly mines, boost you forward, or restore your life!\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>CustoMechs Showdown is a multiplayer versus game developed for the Video game Design and Programming course at the Politecnico di Milano.
