As my first game, it's pretty bad and it comes in multiple games with 1 chapter in each game, and you will have to physically load saves across games. The back story is- While you are driving home from work, you fall in a sink hole, which leads to a separate dimension where it's fight or flight to escape. Uncover secret areas, 20+ weapons, 3 classes, skills, tactics and much more in this top-down style RPG by Grudge Studios.</p>\n<p>V1.33</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6e4298ff5f4206365eb54d013ad15e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grudge Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
