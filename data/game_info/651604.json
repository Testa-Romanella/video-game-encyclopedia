This experimental game is a level I\u00a0designed to practice setting\u00a0some conditions for the player to meet while being moderately challenged in order to\u00a0advance in an interactive environment. It isn't very long, but I hope it brings some level of joy to those of you who take the time to play it.</p>\n<p>If you play it. Thank you!<br/></p>\n<p>P.s. I don't own a PC, so if you play the Windows version, please let me know if it works:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30fbb1fc9b23ed2998aca4d6a7db424e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["subverse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
