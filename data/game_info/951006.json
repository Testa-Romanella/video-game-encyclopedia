Pandemic mode</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A pandemic mode has been added to the game, cells can be infected with a virus that spreads very quickly from one living cell to another. An infected cell can be distinguished by its characteristic red color. However, the virus does not affect the rules of reproduction. Infected cells die from the disease after 15 generations.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>2. Immunity Zone</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Adds a special zone that complements the pandemic mode (does not work without it). In the designated area, cells become immune to the virus if they have been in contact with an infected cell. A cell with immunity can be distinguished by its characteristic green color. Cells with immunity are more viable: if there is at least one living cell with an immune cell and the number of neighboring cells is not more than four, the cell survives until the next generation.\r\n</p>\r\nMade with love by Bardier Andrei \r\nTechnical University of Moldova \r\nFCIM, FAF-213 \r\n2023, Moldova, Chisinau", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T18:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc9bfda745e4e11a3797708d2c4bb1b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ricigeroi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
