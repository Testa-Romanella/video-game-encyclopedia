{"id": 96495, "slug": "spider-police", "name": "SPIDER POLICE", "name_original": "SPIDER POLICE", "description": "<p>Update: Fixed a display glitch. The bottom part of the level should display properly on the web app. The Windows version is unchanged. The web version is now substantially harder than the Windows version. The other web version is still available to download if anybody still wants it for whatever reason.<br/></p><p>This is a game about running away from the spider police. You run through an infinitely long level, and the spider police will spin webs blocking your exits. There's a cool-looking set of red traces that show your possible escape routes and updates dynamically as you play.  It procedurally generates exit routes, and then procedurally tries to block you from them.</p><p>The game runs a flow analysis to determine the exit; it treats the player and a couple squares around the player as sources, and exit squares as sinks. Every square on the map is a node, and adjacent squares have arcs between them. The game runs a Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to determine the player's exit routes, using a flow capacity of 1 for each arc between two non-wall tiles. It actually generates about twice as many paths as \"should\" actually exist, because a single square can have both vertical and horizontal flows going through it, but I thought this looked way cooler so I kept it in.</p><p>The actual map generation is pretty simple. It's just random rectangles drawn on the map. The first time the game seeds rectangles, it makes sure to leave enough room to run a road from the left to the right sides of the screen. After that it doesn't care.</p><p>This worked fine for me in Firefox using the Unity plugin. I also have a Windows build.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/2342bfc8d012db9c0480f929677d9006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HiramSycamore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
