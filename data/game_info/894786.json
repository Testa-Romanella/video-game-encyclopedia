The guards reported that he was having difficulty breathing, even after he had rested for some time, and noticed a rough silver rash developing under his sleeve. He was in no state to speak, and so the guards brought him back to their barracks, but before dawn could break, the man was no longer with us. My guards inspected his body further, noticing small cuts in the skin around his neck, so it pains me to say that a violence upon the people of Greymaw may not be out of the question. Since then, the guards that had received this man have begun to grow sick, and I worry that whatever had happened to this fellow may spread to the rest of the kingdom if left unattended. Without further details, I cannot risk the possibility of conflict, so I must send only you. It is up to you to investigate the town of Greymaw, to learn the source of what is afflicting its people, and to put an end to it.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>I know that I ask much of you, but I know I leave the responsibility in capable hands.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Your Majesty,</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>King Robert III</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>(Some areas of the game are inaccessible in the Demo.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T09:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca7c581678e0d49507f2d5100003076a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oscw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
