Now you can find out! Dungeons &amp; Aliens is an action game with \n      space mutants, brave dwarves, and awesome magic. It combines swipe and \n      slash mechanics (proven to be effective on both aliens and fruit) with \n      Joy-Con\u2122 steering and simple tower defense (as easy as placing \n      vegetation to stop the undead). All this makes for a fun and colourful \n      adventure!\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Key features:\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      \u2022 Fresh mechanics: Swipe and slash meets tower d\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Hand-drawn, old-school storybook graphics\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Upgradable spells for spectacular destruction\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 A comedic mashup of sci-fi and fantasy clich\u00e9s\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 60 challenging levels to beat and then master\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Controls adapted for Nintendo Switch\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:20:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Arts Alliance"], "esrb_rating": null}
