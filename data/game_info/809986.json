Not on the Venus surface, but floating in the clouds.</p>\n<p>At about 50km above the surface\u00a0\u00a0of Venus, the environment changes to the most Earth-like conditions within the Solar System .\u00a0 The atmosphere on Venus also provides the various\u00a0elements required for human life and agriculture: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also, the upper Venus atmosphere provides protection from harmful solar radiation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In just 20 years, humanity had built five\u00a0 self sustaining floating cities above the clouds of Venus.\u00a0 \u00a0Humanity had finally colonized another world.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>However in 2072 reports were coming in that the floating cities were being attacked by crafts of unknown origin. All five floating cities went dark in 2073.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are part of a special forces unit sent to investigate.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Cursor keys to move your ship.<br/></p>\r\nStrategy:\r\n<p>Every floating city you liberate will offer your an upgrade.\u00a0 There are 5 cities but only the first 4 will offer upgrades. Enemies get more shields, and spawn faster each city you liberate.\u00a0\u00a0Choose your upgrade wisely.</p>\n<p>There are 20 enemies to destroy on route to each city. Each enemy is worth 100 points.\u00a0 Once these enemies are\u00a0defeated you engage a\u00a0large ship ('boss').\u00a0 Destroying the large ship earns you 1000 points.\u00a0 Once all five floating cities are liberated you win the game.\u00a0 You get 1000 points for each remaining ship you have after you win the game.</p>\r\nHigh Scores\r\n<p>Scores are saved and persisted on a web server.\u00a0 Please set you name in OPTIONS if you want people to know how great you are.</p>\r\nFuture Enhancements - Post JAM\r\n<p>Enemies attack logic is random.\u00a0 Interested in looking into group formation flying, attack patterns, spawn patterns, similar to Galaga (https://galaga.cc/\u00a0).\u00a0\u00a0Boss fight definitely\u00a0needs major attention.</p>\n<p>Add Powerups (temporary shields, immunity, firing speed, extra lives).\u00a0 Meteors\u00a0will hide the power up, and so you need to destroy the meteors to see the random powerup.</p>\r\nThe Science:\r\n<p>Floating cities on Venus:\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus</p>\r\nLicenses:\r\n<p><strong>Enemy graphics:</strong> Space Shooter Redux from\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux.\u00a0\u00a0License: (CC0 1.0 Universal)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Player and background graphics</strong>: NASA:\u00a0https://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/smab/havoc/</p>\n<p><strong>Music Intro</strong>:\u00a0McFunkypants:\u00a0Draft Monk - ambient loop for games - CC0 public\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Music Enemy</strong>: Komiku:\u00a0Run against the universe -\u00a0\u00a0CC0 1.0 Universal License</p>\n<p><strong>Main Menu Music</strong>:\u00a0One Cool Minute by Loyalty Freak Music - t<em>his track is free to use without attribution\u00a0even commercially (monetization).
