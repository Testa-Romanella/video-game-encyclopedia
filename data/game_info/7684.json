No one knows where it started, but within days every continent had an outbreak. Those that survived the initial attack made their way to Greenland to regroup and plan their offensive.<br/><br/>The time has come to reclaim the Earth. Most of the zombies have been rendered immobile by natural disasters, accidents, and general decay. There are still small groups roaming our cities, and it is time to wipe them out.<br/><br/>Your job is to demolish the remaining cities with a heavy zombie population. This will be a difficult mission as the plane can only carry four bombs at a time.
