This game gives you much freedom to enjoy its peaceful, yet visually rich world.</p>\r\nMoonshot\r\n<p>The game features a day/night cycle system. You start at dawn and once you reach midnight you are brought back to the start of the level. Still, the most interesting and rewarding part of the game, which is your balloon, is hard to reach in a full day. It pushes the player to plan and learn the level to get to the balloon and take off before it's too late to enjoy a long and peaceful flight.</p>\n<p>Also, the lore and story of the game is centered around the survival of the space dream after civilization collapse.
