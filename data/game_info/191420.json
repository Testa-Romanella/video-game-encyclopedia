A band of drug gangs have teamed up, to fight the cops, and to save their hot spot drug businesses, surrounding the city. Max must take them out at all cost,\u00a0while waiting for backup to arrive. Be careful of the innocent people roaming the streets, and animals, if not, Max will waste his ammo and be killed by the drug gangs, before backup arrives. Protect the city, before the community is over run by drug gangs, and their businesses. Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2cdb4b1a0af6a275b2c98be82249d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mcolverdesigns"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
