Use the arrow keys to move, hold z while moving to go slower, x to use skill when it's charged to 100, and space to shoot (skill deletes most projectiles). (Full screen recommended).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Press C during cutscenes to skip it (does not work on level ending cutscenes).</p>\n<p>(On a certain special fight, you'd only need 25 skill to use one.)</p>\n\n<p>Warning: Game contains Flashing Lights and words that can be considered offensive probably (at least to someone maybe), like kill, heck,\u00a0 shut up, lame, weak, (words in french), pathetic, dumb, (bad jokes), discipline, rubbish, and more. (Also it's hard).\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Inspired by things like Touhou, Bullet Heaven, a li'l bit of Sushi Cat, wee bit of Library of Ruina, and maybe a bit of Metal Gear Rising.

Also, there are certain songs from a popular bullet heck game and a certain noise from a funni cat person. Png of a certain construction vehicle from Bing images next to a sound effect from something rather *Bizarre*. \"A\" is owned by a scratcher\u00a0named skitty5.</p>\n<p>The music made with the scratch music block things are by me (so are the ones made by online sequencer).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b4758f20a6982c28dff8978a9058572e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tristo Pristo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
