You and your friends can expect 20 exciting and challenging games. Whether it\u2019s KOPFRECHNEN, ZUORDNEN or BUCHSTABEN - this clearly requires brains and a quick finger. LATTLSCHIESSEN, WURF REVERSI or BALLBALL is all about good timing, but above all it is a matter of intuition. Of course, we did not forego BLAMIEREN ODER KASSIEREN, and <strong>ELTON</strong> once again leads the show with confidence.
