{"id": 499280, "slug": "pp-puncher", "name": "PP Puncher", "name_original": "PP Puncher", "description": "<h3>Basic Presentation</h3>PP Puncher is a turn-based RPG, mostly text-based, about a guy going on a quest to save his waifus, by punching his opponents' PP. The game stacks new game mechanics to the fight system, as the player progresses into the game.<h3>The Story</h3>A scientist named Brenn finally managed to make his waifu real, by turning his body pillows into real people. Unfortunately, he also published music under the name of \"Brennfeu Cthulhu\", which made Cthulhu angry. Cthulhu then sent Espinoza, a newly created Eldritch God to kidnapp Brenn's waifus.  <br/>Brenn now has to free all waifus, and confront Espinoza.<h3>In-Game</h3>The game is a turn-based RPG. As you progress into the game, you unlock new game mechanics, making the game slowly more and more complex.<h3>Origin of the Game</h3>At first, this game was a discord bot, allowing you to play duels against other discord users (or the 'A.I.'). We then realized that the game had no learning curve, and was too complex for new players to get into. We then decided to turn this bot, into a game, with its own story based on the lore that was slowly created around the bot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f6170c52c4c9cd094811dd3cc1f8dea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["brennfeu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["brennfeu"], "esrb_rating": null}
