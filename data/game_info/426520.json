Enemies are lethal, but so are you. Use your mobility and sneaking tactics to outwit your enemies and reach the end of each stage!<br/></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<br/></em>How does this game works?</p>\n<ul><li>Enemies can see from their front and hear you from behind. They will chase you until you escape their line of SIGHT and/or SOUND. They will always kill you in one attack.\u00a0<ul><li>While you have their attention, you\u00a0<em>can not kill them.</em>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Stay out of their line of sight. If you are behind them, use the SNEAK key to approach them, and use the ATTACK key while sneaking to kill them in one stroke.\u00a0<ul><li>Failing to sneak while close to an enemy will always alert them.\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>If alerted, the eye icon on the top left will signify that enemy is aware of you\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>If the eye icon is closed (slashed eye) then you are undetected\u00a0<br/>\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Additionally, objects scattered around the levels can be used to hide you from your pursuers. Use your HIDE key to hide behind things like shelves, crates, and hanging banners, causing\u00a0enemies\u00a0to end their chase.\u00a0<ul><li>Try and discover what all different objects you can hide behind!\u00a0Some hide-able objects are not obvious!\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Please Read:\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>We would appreciate your feedback, please take out some time to answer our survey, thank you!</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIVuPaYaiY5XTmuCzKZTH10v4VuTnqeIPY43GO...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Also, if you would like to see our blogs on how we developed the game, please visit here:</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0https://magesoftware.code.blog/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:45:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffef4fff14a30d98d28feab863a1ac5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["magesoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
