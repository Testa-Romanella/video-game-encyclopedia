Using this, you have to lead the ball to the cup. (the game is a bit buggy for now, so you need to click on the right side of the platfoms if you want them to rotate correctly). For now there are only 10 levels, but I will surely make more later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In some levels, there is a switch in the upper-left corner of the screen, allowing you to change the gravity (up or down) or to change the polarity of the magnetic platforms (in red), leading to the ball being attracted or pushed by the magnetic platforms in the level.</p>\n<p>Controls: -hold left mouse button while dragging the platform in a direction to make a platform rotate</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-left click to activate the switches or the menu buttons</p>\n<p>Sprites used : -UI : Free Game GUI by pzUH (https://opengameart.org/content/free-game-gui)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Unity's default 2D Sprites pack(https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/73728)</p>\n<p>Music used : -ES_Curiosity Cabinet 1 - H\u00e5kan Eriksson</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-ES_Simple Pleasantries 2 - Gavin Luke</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-ES_That's Fine (Instrumental Version) - Henrik Nagy</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Matti_Paalanen_-_Children</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-MFYM_-_137_Children_Playground</p>\n<p>Made with Unity, programmed in C#.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa68e1b3e87761965a226c3cac3a3a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["FadaGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
