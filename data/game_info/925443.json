The objective of the game is to connect all the trees in the world through the use of tendrils, or strands, which grow from the organism. Players must search for food and trees to grow their tendrils, but must also be mindful of their food consumption, which increases as the tendrils grow larger. To play the game, players can use the middle mouse button to pan, the mouse wheel to zoom, the left mouse button to grow a strand, and the right mouse button to delete a strand. Success requires a combination of strategy and skill, as players must make efficient networks and trim their tendrils as necessary to conserve food.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>To pan, click the middle mouse button</p>\n<p>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out</p>\n<p>Left-click to grow a strand</p>\n<p>Right-click to delete a strand</p>\n<p>--<br/><br/>Credit Me and Ozzy.D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e250a3ebc0af94c76a8922422019e91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kivylius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
