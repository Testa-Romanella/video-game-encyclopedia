It was originally made in Unreal 5.0 for my project\u00a0<em>Project: Time Thief</em>\u00a0but was copy and pasta'd down to Unreal 4.23 so it could be on browser. I put this together very quick so it lacks character art but the sound should give you a good idea. Have fun trying to reach the top. It is intentionally hard to try and test the games mechanics.\u00a0<em>Project Time Thief</em> is still in development and has a more detailed explanation on my portfolio linked below.
