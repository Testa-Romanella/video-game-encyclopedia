Use A and D to tilt for boost and aerodynamical lift!</li><li>Watchout for your height as you will freeze and drop if your altitude is too high!</li><li>You can use the banana as slope, or not, or even use it backwards!</li></ol>\n\n<p>Getting the Trees\u00a0and the mountains (eggs) to work took me quite a chunk of time that I didn't have time for further polishing.
