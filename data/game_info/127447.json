The goal is to match penguins humming the same note. Think match-3 with sound instead of color! If that's not your style, you can always arrange the penguins to create a musical masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to rearrange penguins, Z and X to change the tempo, and space to navigate menus.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
