After losing your entire flock, you set off to warn the nearby town, and mysteriously find yourself in control of an other-worldly power as you do.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Main Features</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li> Battle a variety of evil creatures in a combat system that combines elements of Hearthstone and Final Fantasy.</li>\n<li>Level up through battle to visit the Astral Realm, where you can learn new abilities in your Constellation (ie your skill tree).</li>\n<li>Choose between different races and abilities to find the optimal strategy.</li>\n<li>Lots of music.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tThe game is multi-platform and can currently be played on pc, android phone or in-browser.

Seek out the source of the evil - the area boss - to save the town, and unlock clues to who has been messing with the stars... and if this person plans to stop... (spoiler: they don't)\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Battle - how it works</strong>\n</p><p>\nTo attack an enemy, click-drag from one of your tiles to an enemy tile.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe battle screen features three tiles located bottom-center, and you click-drag from these tiles onto another tile to perform an attack. The left tile corresponds to your left hand ability, the middle tile corresponds to your summon ability, and the right tile corresponds to your magical staff ability.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo summon an ally, click-drag from the middle tile onto one of the three tiles in front of the player. This will deplete your mana when used.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo attack with an ally, click drag from that ally onto an enemy tile. This will deplete that ally's stamina meter - allies can only attack when they have full stamina.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo use a magic attack, click-drag from the left or right tile.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAt the beginning of the game, you only have one right/left handed attack available.
