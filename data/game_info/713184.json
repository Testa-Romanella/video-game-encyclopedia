The legend says that the darker the hearts of people, the more sinister of monsters appear. However, in recent years, the Valdradians have started doubting the legend. In return, the crime rate in the city has begun to rise. In order to combat this, the kingdom has dispatched a top detective, the player, to reduce the crime. Upon arriving in the city, you find a relic of the past that allows you to enter mirrors, windows, and other reflective images that will bring you the city's mirrored world, run by monsters. Despite being monsters, they are actually gentle beings \u2014 unless their human counterpart is up to no good. When this happens, they start behaving weirdly and are placed in confinement, until their human is caught. You find that you can use these monsters to figure out what crimes their human counterpart has done, but the catch is that the monster does not know what they have done nor who their counterpart is. You must use clues in both the monster world and the human world to catch these criminals before evil monsters overrun both worlds.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T08:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3efd4f71ba3d1c760e8361018acf76e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The_Sharingan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
