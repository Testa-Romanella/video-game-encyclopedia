But unfortunately, the repair has not been finished at the intersection. A rupture formed under the intersection and the workers have to urgently make a temporary crossing. It turns out to be very fragile and only with the money help of residents it is possible to promptly ensure the delivery of modular parts for the bridge. Help people evacuate!</p>\n<p>Created by:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Victor Sakharov</li><li>Daniil Chebotkov</li><li>Vladislav Pastushok</li></ul>\n<p>Game Engine:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li></ul>\n<p>Tutorial &amp; Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>You can repair bridge with tiles.
