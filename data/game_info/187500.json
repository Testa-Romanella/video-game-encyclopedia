It took 3.75 hours to make (I spent 45 minutes on it two days later making it slightly better), and is a terrible, terrible game.</p><p>You have to move around a field dodging red dots, and picking up orange dots to enter bullet time mode (slows down enemies who have timer based movement - you don't). When the song ends you should be able to see the win screen... I wouldn't know for I cannot beat my own game.</p><p>Programming: Cian Rice</p><p>Art: Cian Rice</p><p>Song: \"Arroz\" by Vinicius Pippa</p><p>Built in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97a7e998878b977e932aa715f0a35f6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cian Rice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
