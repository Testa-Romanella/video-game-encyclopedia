This is so far my best and my proudest work, having written over 1200+ lines of code. The problem statement for the game, was helping people learn about the electricity consumption of their household appliances. Exurbia helps achieve this through horror. Since the target audience is people aged between 20-30 years old, and based on the research my groups mates and I did, we thought a horror game would be the most fun way to teach people about electricity consumption.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T22:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/311e10d283e45a564eb741a74df68cdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Chelmu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
