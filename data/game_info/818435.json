You are a full time employee that guess dice rolls for people in the world because in this world there is no complete randomness. Your superior, Arch gives you tasks and daily requirements for your work and you are undercharge. But this is only job you find in a while, so don't get fired or you are gonna starve. <strong>I didn't make it in time so there are lots of missing features and unbalanced parts in this game.</strong><br/></p>\r\nMissing Features:\r\n<ul><li>3 main characters\r\n<ul><li>Arch : Player's superior, he gives small tasks ( aka. miracles ) and moderate payment if players complete this tasks.</li><li>Duke : If player calls him from office phone, he give player bribe jobs. Bribe jobs are player select correct stamp for specific person for small amount of money. Duke tells that person's name so its low risk, low reward jobs. Additionally if player does this jobs too much, duke gets too much power and game ends.</li><li>Lucy : Make deals with player. Deals are high risk, high reward jobs. Lucy only tells small hints about specific person and player have to find him/her and make him/her win at that game. Player give Lucy moderate amount of money so if player can't finish deal, lose all the money. Otherwise player win twice of that money.</li></ul></li><li>Dialogues with these 3 main characters.</li><li>Home.</li><li>Upgrades for home and office.</li><li>Time &amp; day based events.</li><li>Different weathers and ambient sounds.</li><li>Portraits for people and main characters.</li><li>Animations</li><li>Intro</li></ul>\r\nUnbalanced Things:\r\n<ul><li>Time go too fast to play.</li><li>There is an visual artifact while sun rising.</li><li>Player mustn't start immediately to work because its too hard to check requirements of shift. So its need to add at least 15 - 30 seconds free time to inspect books and other thins on the desk.</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You only need mouse to play, first you have to check minimum and maximum numbers from paper on the left of screen. If you make your mean value in this\u00a0range you are gonna get full payment, otherwise your superior gonna cut about half of your payment. Then find papers in middle of your screen these are people's rolls and your job is decide which number they are gonna get from dice. There are six stamps on your bottom left of your screen. You chose one of them and stamp the paper ,then drag the paper to top center of your screen. You repeat this until your shift has ended or you finished to stamp all of the papers. If you finish all the 6 days without bankrupt ( -80 $ bankruptcy threshold ) you win.<br/></p>\r\nSoftwares Used:\r\n<ul><li>Unity Game Engine</li><li>Aseprite</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32ec7d1c2f0385eb2fac418a5e6f5537.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mithrilfire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
