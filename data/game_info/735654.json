Your name is whispered by enemies and allies with fear and respect alike, some says it\u2019s your arm that bears the weight of the entire kingdom.<br/><br/>They call you the King\u2019s hound. It started as a way to taunt you but it\u2019s not that far away from the truth. Your loyalty is blind, your devotion absolute. The King\u2019s vision is your vision.<br/><br/><strong>Your name will forever mark history alongside theirs.</strong><br/><br/>But for now, you are being shipped to your betrothed, alone and powerless on your way to Camelot.<br/><br/>As the seventh child of the Venegard House, you\u2019ve always had little to look forward to other than an arranged marriage to achieve a political alliance. That\u2019s exactly why, after your parents lost the rebellion against King Arthur, you were the one sent to him as a sign of newfound peace.<br/><br/>You don\u2019t know what awaits you now, but after you Camelot will never be the same.\r\n\r\nRomantic Options\r\n<strong>\n</strong>\n\r\n\r\nKing Arthur (he/they pronouns)\r\n<p>The noble, compassionate and fair leader of Camelot. Protective and respectful, Arthur is going to give you as much freedom, space and support as you may need. Play your cards right and, if you choose to be their spouse only by name, they\u2019ll become a very supportive wingman. No matter what you\u2019ll be to them, you are enchanted by their vision from the moment you understand what they are fighting for. You know you\u2019ll stand by their side no matter what. [25yo]\r\n</p>\r\nKnight Yniol (M/F/NB)\r\n<p>One of the knights at the Round Table, almost 6\u20196\u201d (2.00m) and the only one who fights with a spear, Yniol could be intimdating at first, but only to those who do not know how much they care for every single one of you. Composed and focused, they are the most gentle knight you\u2019ll ever have the pleasure to meet. They\u2019ve had their eyes on you from the moment you first arrived to Camelot and, close or not, you are now under their protection. [26yo]\r\n</p>\r\nKnight Evaine (M/F/NB)\r\n<p>The most mysterious knight of the Round Table. You know they hide something under that carfree attitude because their fa\u00e7ade craks most often than not. They recover fast, but every time their eyes are lost in the void at your shoulders a bit longer. They treat you like something fragile and delicate but maybe that\u2019s the care they need themselves. Despite what some other knights say about them, they are not careless at all. In fact, all their movements and words are carefully measured, expecially around you. [24yo]\r\n</p>\r\nThe physician Morien (M/F/NB)\r\n<p>They are the caring, if a bit pragmatic, physician of the Round Table knights. Reserved and, at times, abrasive, they bear in their eyes the horror of a war that should never have happened. Despite this, or maybe because of this, you feel like they are one of the only one who can understand what you\u2019ve gone through. They could become your most trusted confidant or, if you want, you could be for eachother the support pillar you both desperately need. [27yo]\r\n</p>\r\nYour personal servant Gwyar (M/F/NB)\r\n<p>They are the one who\u2019s been tasked with assisting you, and they have all the intention to make you feel comfortable and secure under their care. Born in the wild lands, they have traveled many miles towars Camelot in search of a future at court. Understanding, even while mantaining the proper distance, they will remain composed and mildly humorous until you show them signs of your interest. Expect them to be one of the most flattering and tender of all the ROs.
