Can you help find them all?</p>\n<p>Shelfy is a charming little platformer that combines basic platforming with a unique weight system. Each time you collect a book, you get heavier!</p>\n<p>This extra weight can either help or hinder you, making large blocks pushable and making platforms crumble beneath your feet!</p>\n<p>(Tip: The down smash completely cancels out your momentum. Use it if you need to make precise jumps!)</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Coding - Finian</p>\n<p>Art - Josh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/31164a0a9563c0d473d68a0715067822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["finian1"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
