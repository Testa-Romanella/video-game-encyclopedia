This world suffers from their rule, and in honor of your grandfather, Enrico Fermi, giving his life in attempting to build\u00a0the Chicago Pile-1, you go back in time to complete the job. You wake up in the body of your grandfather, and take on his mission yourself. Build the pile and return back to your time, or don't. Either way, your mission is to stop the Nazis before they win the war.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was built using Twine, and should not take more than 15 minutes to play through once. There are seven different endings, some more subtle than others. This game was made as part of a group project, and we hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24b1e8953f3fc953679079d7eacbc80e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["delrthtak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
