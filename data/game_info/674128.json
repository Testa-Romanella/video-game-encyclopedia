Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events,\u00a0<strong>is totally intentional</strong>.</p>\n<p>Having say that, most charactes are there to serve as a means to foward the little plot there is, so the ony similarity with actual users is mostly in name only.<br/><br/>The only important stats in the game are HP, Atk and Def, nothing more. The combat is simple but follows the mechanics of games like AW or Langrisser where a unit will deal less damage the less hp it has.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214b949b173cb88ef3837012cfe0aeda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anarch16Sync"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
