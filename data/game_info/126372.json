Keep the egg up in the air for as long as you can. Brag to your friends about how you spent 2 hours getting a 1000 score, and notice how nobody will care about it after the fact.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Demo Video:</p>\n<p>(UPDATE, 10/1/2017)</p>\n<p>Fixed bug where the first hit wouldn't be registered if hit at the right moment. Also smoothed position and timing correction a bit. It's still noticeable at the top of the parabola, but it generally looks better.</p><p>(UPDATE, 10/1/2017)</p>\n<p>Timing for song is slightly improved, along with other small improvements to graphics and the timing scripts. Now there is also a dedicated key (\"R\") for retrying. (Thanks to homer_3 for the idea!)</p>\n<p>There is also now a working HTML 5 version, so please go and try it out! Thank you!</p>\n<p>(UPDATE, 9/27/2017)</p>\n<p>Uploaded a Zipped build of the last update; Windows 10 was reporting that the all-in-one executable was a potential threat due to the file compressor used. This build should work fine, just run it from the ZIP file.</p>\n<p>(UPDATE, 9/25/2017)</p>\n<p>Fixed speed issue on lower-end machines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef68540e983eb12edbc344dacd317eb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["CheapGSean"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
