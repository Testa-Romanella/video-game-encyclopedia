You must get to the goal with nothing but your skill and patience as you try to progress through a world where fighting back is not an option for you, but hey, at yeast you\u2019ve got legs. Any character additions or modifiers will come strictly through the levels, no shops or money systems as frankly you don\u2019t have the time or resources to make any dough. Rye-s to the occasion and get back what was wrongfully taken from you, but most of all have fun, no-one likes a sourdough.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p>\n<p>Boing sound - https://gfxsounds.com/sound-effect/game-jump-boing/</p>\n<p>Player Hurt - https://gfxsounds.com/sound-effect/heavy-body-hit/</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>New York Baguette (Menu Music) - https://www.dargolan-free.com/world-music</p>\n<p>Swing Time -\u00a0https://www.dropbox.com/s/6avs26aeaq9qe8p/Swing%20Time.wav?dl=0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Art</strong></p>\n<p>Menu Background - https://www.reddit.com/r/tamagotchi/comments/dwjlzj/kikis_bg_done_3_drawing_with...</p>\n<p>Baguette Healthbar - http://pixelartmaker.com/art/e28315a56835976</p>\n<p>Menu buttons - https://nectanebo.itch.io/menu-buttons</p>\n<p>Super Retro World Pack - https://gif-superretroworld.itch.io/interior-pack?download</p>\n<p>Kings and Pigs - https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/kings-and-pigs</p>\n<p>Rodent - https://opengameart.org/content/rodents-rat-rework</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a22cfa17a0b80eec639263d1ac2540e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suttie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
