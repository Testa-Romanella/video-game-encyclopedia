It's similar to Snake, except you must compete against other computer-controlled snakes to reach a certain number of points first. To do this, you not only have to keep track of your own snake but also employ powerups called \"Tricks\" which you can use to hinder your opponents.</p>\n<p>Currently in Version 1.0 - Game is completed and working fine. Might update/polish it in the future as well as fix any bugs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e2bdfaefc21065b109a5f058988bab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Graphcalibur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
