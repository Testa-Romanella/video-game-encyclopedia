Get engulfed in an arcadey storm of beats, bombs, combos and do your best to keep the rhythm alive.</p>\n<p>Team: Hocke (Lead-Programmer), Wraygo (Sound Design, Programmer), whywelose (Lead-Artist)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T20:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea7d484c09df165143bcd1a1b0f97bde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wraygo", "Hocke", "whywelose"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
