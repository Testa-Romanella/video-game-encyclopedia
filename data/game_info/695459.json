Particles!<br/>Play through the psyche of a comatose daredevil who still can't stop thinking about taking risks. You can't move very quickly, but are equipped with a teleport... that spawns bombs whenever used! <br/>Defeat packs of enemies in increasingly difficult and sprawling floors of a dungeon while taking as many risks as you can - they'll reward you with more money!<br/><br/>A project extended in my spare time from a concept for Ludum\u00a0Dare 49 and inspired by Stuffed Wombat's submission to a Miziziziz art kit jam a while back. You can find the original here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f6474389edfeb8387e8005c2aec149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roey_Shap"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
