Bad news: magic is\u00a0<em>highly</em>\u00a0illegal. Star Seeker is a\u00a0<em>wizard</em>\u00a0and you must solve a\u00a0<em>wizard crime</em>\u00a0or else get thrown in\u00a0<em>wizard jail</em>\u00a0by\u00a0<em>wizard</em>- I mean, just regular police. There's been a murder- but the murder is in the full game, coming November 4, 2020. This is the free demo, which means the case you're solving is the case of just where the heck Star left their dang keys. And wallet. And spellbook full of arcane magicks. Can't solve a murder if you can't leave the house!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Wishlist on Steam, or just wait until the full game's out here on itch.io and buy it here!<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/StarSeekerGame<br/></p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/hrx5mf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e5a08e44ef8807d76683cb1b7a67d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BenedictIde"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
