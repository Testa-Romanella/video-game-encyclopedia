They gave power to humankind and watched as the clans fought each other to capture the power of the others. The Gods decided to separate this power into 2 parts. That is how the powers of Love and War were born. Goddess Ladeina and God Khain were assigned to protect these powers .<br/><br/><br/><br/>One day the Gods started to fight each other. This war took a long time and after this fight, the Gods decided to separate into many pieces and create artifacts made of these powers.
