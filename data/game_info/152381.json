In a rocket! But it is rush hour, so there is no space in space. Can you still make it to the moon?</p>\n<p>=== ATTENTION ===<br/>I created the game in only 4 hours, because I had no time this weekend. But I managed to participate at least, and in my opinion, the game is pretty complete for only 4 hours.</p>\n<p>========= How To Play ==========<br/>Press SPACE to control your rocket. It cannot be any more simple.</p>\n<p>======== Music and Sound Effects ========<br/>If you do not like the music and / or the sound effects, press the Sound on/off button in the top right corner.</p>\n<p>======== Feedback ========<br/>If you have feedback or found a bug, please leave a comment here or on the itch.io page, or tweet me at @dievo.</p>\n<p>======== Versions =======<br/>Windows Versions are available via itch.io. Sourcecode is available as Dropbox Download.</p>\n<p>======== Bugs =========<br/>Resolution: If your game is cut off on the edges, please use a 16:9 resolution, for example 1920x1080. Use the download version for best results.</p>\n<p>======== Development ========<br/>The game was made in Unity. Graphics were created with Adobe Illustrator. Sound was created with BFXR and Bosca Ceoil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>========= FUTURE ======<br/>Next LD, I plan to do a full 48 hour compo again. Did not have the time this weekend unfortunately, so the game is very simple.</p>\n<p>A Ludum Dare 42 Compo entry. The game was made by Thomas Diehl in 4 hours.
