I was really into Granada on the Mega Drive and decided to make an approximation of the game systems set in a different environment. After finishing the core systems, the project sat on the shelf for a while. In March 2017 I returned to Lobster Tank with a week of spare time dedicated to the project, determined to see how far I could get in development with a limited time frame. In this week the bulk of development was completed, but over the following weeks little things were still being polished and flourishes like the tire tracks were added. I hope you enjoy playing the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f32/f324e77a96c569935f271aa66c66dd44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oprel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
