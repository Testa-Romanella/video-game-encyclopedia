Maybe you were before, but that doesn't matter now. The important thing is that you are standing in front of a farm and you are completely unaware of how to operate it. So you do what any responsible food producer does and read the farm's instruction manual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here you quickly learn that the proper use of the farm is relatively simple, at least the first of the hundreds of pages seem quite clear: you plant stuff like this, and then you harvest it. Some of the stuff grows better when planted next to other stuff.</p>\n<p>So far so good. Now try to grow as much grain as possible and don't let the aliens steal your cows.</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>This game is about planting and harvesting crops.</p>\n<p>To win a level you need to reach the goal written at the top.</p>\n<p>To plant crops or play an effect select a card on the right. Crops come as tiles. You need to find an empty slot on your field for them (red means it does not fit here).</p>\n<p>Click to drop the crops onto your field. Rotate a tile by pressing the right mouse button or using the buttons on the bottom of the screen</p>\n<p>Crops on the field become harvested whenever a row or column is full.
