Harry Cooper, commonly known as \u2018The Mastermind\u2019 in a flash of inspiration, had the idea of creating a binaural based audio game. Naturally, Connor and Jordan were instantly on board. Using our past experience in sound design, composition, game development and narrative construction, we combined forces to create the company that we are today. With an unprecedented desire to excel in creative industries, we set upon our journey to create a diverse, deep and exciting journey through our dark and eccentric world.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Demo Gameplay by YouTuber 'Illegally Sighted'</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0https://youtu.be/pLGWFGdn_e0</p>\n<p><strong>Binaural Trailer</strong>\u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0https://youtu.be/ZDvv7O-LD7U</p>\n<p><strong>Character Trailers -\u00a0</strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClPlJqS3bqM&amp;list=PLPKODfyzE5oJHTD0mH2_B0fEwZyN5ggHg</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Overview</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0https://youtu.be/QJbNNGLuGx8\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Development Vlogs</strong>\u00a0<strong>-</strong>\u00a0https://youtu.be/h2yKZTmTd8M?list=PLPKODfyzE5oKldssJcw5Q9npg2q7-RuxC\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0https://twitter.com/dusklightpro<br/><strong>Facebook</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/PitchBlackADusklightStory/<br/><strong>Discord</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0https://discord.gg/mvaxWrj</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:54:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ecbe91761b4315af51d0998fece8940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pitch Black"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
