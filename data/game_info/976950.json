Professional voice actors read all of the dialogue, similar to an audiobook. Camera movements make transitions to each scene, creating a filmic feeling. Pages are tinted with color by AI and by hand. However, this is optional and a traditional black-and-white option is available.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T13:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/757239556b94caaba5d75847e14661a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MediBang TraDe"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["MediBang TraDe"], "esrb_rating": null}
