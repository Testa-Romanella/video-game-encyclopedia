Play Bacteria Breaker!</strong>\n<p>\u201cWatch out, red alert\u2026 Watch out, red alert\u2026\u201d<br/>Invaders from another planet are attacking the Human Body! Their goal ? Establish themselves in your body and transform it into an operational base.<br/>A first witness to this invasion was there to go off the alarm: Captain Globulo Blanco!</p>\n<p>A few days ago, Globulo Blanco realized that his human host was starting to tire for no apparent reason ... Concerned with understanding the origin of this fatigue, he began to patrol the Human Body, passing through the veins and arteries, liver, stomach, etc.\u00a0<br/>It was when he was by stopping in the lungs that Globulo Blanco thought it was wise to continue his research within the small Alveolus inn\u2026 Indeed, many foreign visitors come to the inn, arriving thanks to the air that the Human Body breathes. It is a place of passage where we often meet Oxygenos, Dioxydis of carbon, and sometimes Palynos (which are hairy pollens that scratch), Pollution-boys (harmful particles of pollution), or some nasty bacteria like Streptococcus and Influenzus\u2026 Fortunately, Captain Globulo Blanco always arrives in time to expel them with his police officers the Anticorpus!<br/>But this time, entering the hostel, Globulo Blanco was seized by the heavy atmosphere ... Usually these places are noisy, happy and full of life, especially when the band of Oxygenos is passing! However, only a few Oxygenos are present today, sad and tired. They watch Globulo Blanco enter, and point out the responsible: under a purple cape, a nasty bacteria is there. A bacteria that the captain had never encountered before ...<br/>Globulo Blanco approaches her to question her, and then he sees her evil gaze.<br/>In a treacherous smile, she addresses him: \u201cWe are the Bacteria and have infested the Human Body, we are already present in other hostels\u2026 we are preparing our attack to make this Body our new base, you do not can nothing against us Globulo Blanco! Ah ah ah ah ah * sadistic laugh*! \u201d</p>\n<p>Quick ! Help Globulo Blanco and his Anticorpus police stop the Bacteria invaders before they reach their target. Send them out of the Human Body by exploding them!</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple: prevent the bad Bacteria from infiltrating your body!<br/>To do this, pop them all with disinfectant solutions!<br/>But beware, bacteria and microbes will appear faster and faster ...<br/>You must avoid exploding the bad scrolling bubbles which will make you lose points, while collecting the maximum number of bonus points by bursting the good bubbles necessary for your survival.</p>\n<p>In this alpha version of Bacteria Breaker, you will have to complete several missions: collect as many points as possible, destroy as many bacteria as possible and stay in good shape and good health!</p>\n<p>NB: the team from the French studio Event Orizon has developed this Alpha version of Bacteria Breaker.
