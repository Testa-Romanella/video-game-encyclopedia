It aims to entertain kids, elderly people, and other casual gamers.\r\n</p>\n<p>The purpose is to keep a rolling ball onto a rotating and shrinking planck as long as possible. The player fights against gravity, wind gusts, and time.</p>\n<p>The player can press the \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\" key to change difficulty at any time. This will change the following parameters :</p>\n<ul><li>The shrinking rate of the planck</li><li>The rotating speed of the planck</li><li>The strength of the wind gusts</li><li>The speed of the wind changes</li></ul>\n<p>I also made this project to learn Unity, and now I share the code to let others learn and improve the game. The source code is available at https://github.com/abienvenu/rotaplanche - pull requests are welcome :-)</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/750382d49697b061db651901b4b5c154.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arnaud Bienvenu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
