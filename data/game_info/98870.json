I mainly wanted to practice producing my own art assets and finishing a working game, though in the end I had to fall back on some of the default assets in RMVX Ace due to time contraints.</p><p>The game is rather brutal and cheap, as it will kill a player who doesn't know the incoming attack pattern, or who wanders into a new area underleveled. But it is rather interesting once one gets the hang of it. Using the right abilities at the right time is very important.</p><p>Full Soundtrack can be found at:</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/aaroarvola/sets/dusk-and-da...</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Alt + Enter = Full Screen mode</li><li>Confirm: Z</li><li>Cancel: X</li><li>Dash: Shift</li><li>Movement: \u2190\u2191\u2193\u2192 Arrow Keys</li></ul><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Turn-based battle system</li><li>4 characters with unique  abilities</li><li>Dangerous enemies and bosses</li><li>2 dungeons, each with distinct atmosphere</li><li>Day and Night time exploration</li><li>Original Map, Monster and Character art</li><li>Original Soundtrack</li></ul><p>Credits:<br/></p><ul><li>Sami Kaisanlahti (Game Design &amp; Art)</li><li>Aaro Arvola (Music)</li></ul><p>Additional Scripts by:<br/></p><ul><li>Yanfly</li><li>Hime Works</li><li>Modern Algebra</li><li>Seer UK</li><li>OriginalWij</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb40777fe82333bc8d44779ef01935af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuvestrahl"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
