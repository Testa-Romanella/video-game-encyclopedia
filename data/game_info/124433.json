Music, sprites, and tiles were provided by Enterbrain, the wonderful contributing members of RPGMakerVX.net, and Bluelaguna.net.</em></strong><em><strong> Gameplay scripts were also provided by the members of RPGMakerVX.net, but were modified by me to create the solo battle system.</strong></em><br/></p><p><strong>Summary</strong><br/></p><p>In devil Theory: Alpha, you play as Rebecca Delgado, a young girl trying to make a living during times of war. The game is strictly a solo RPG, meaning you control Rebecca and Rebecca alone. Fights are fast and frantic, requiring skill to defeat up to 5 enemies in  battle. Underneath the gameplay is an in-depth story told in the perspective of an older Rebecca, who is currently on the side of an enemy nation. Slowly, players will discover how this girl goes from a straggling run-away, to a soldier working for a malicious nation.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p><p>The game uses an ATB-like system for battles. The twist is, the enemy is the one who has to wait in order to attack. You, the player, do not. Once your gauge fills up at the start of battle, it will not go down even after performing an attack. You will be able to line up attacks one after another. Sound easy? It is in fact, NOT. Your lack of waiting does not mean you can go trigger happy. Enemies may take a while to attack you, but they hit HARD, so you must make sure to activate your Barrier (pressing the A key) in order to lessen damage. When you are sure the enemy is finished attacking, hit them back! Then defend...then hit back! It's a rinse and repeat process, but it keeps you on your toes, especially when mobs increase in quantity. Keep in mind that when the Barrier is activated, it is active the second you hit the A key. The command menu will appear again, but you will still be in Defense mode until you use an item, or attack. Once you use an item or attack, you will have to press the A key again to Defend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13cd78c9a9e606f8b2965fa61b3ecd6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TKsuperturbo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
