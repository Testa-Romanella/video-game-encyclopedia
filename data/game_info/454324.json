This is going to be the adventure part of the game. I want to get an idea of what people think to the design of my game. You can go into the different houses and I have started working on dialogue so if you see a button in the corner of the screen that says continue just click that until it disappears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to explore and let me know what you think to what I have so far.\u00a0 I have started to put the traps into my game and I have 2 more left to do. I will then work on the rest of the towns for my game as well.</p>\n<p>You use the arrow keys to move and once you have had a play leave as you normally would. I look forward to seeing any comments and suggestions for this. I will keep working on this so make sure you keep checking back to see what has changed.\u00a0Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa1/aa1e6f0a20b36665c4ddf499d98431ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LukeScott1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
