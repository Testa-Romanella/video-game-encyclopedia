Take some time to unplug on the Lazy River.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lazy River is a physics based puzzle game of floating down a Lazy River.\u00a0 It has the *unique* mechanic of unplugging your controller as a way of interacting with the game (taking the theme \"Out of Control\" literally).</p>\n\n<p>The controller is on</p>\n\n<p>The wall is there when you have the controller on and plugged in.</p>\n\n<p>The controller is off</p>\n<p>And it disappears when you unplug the controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this means you do NEED a Wired Gamepad Controller to play the game.\u00a0 Hopefully a good number\u00a0of you have one of those, though.\u00a0 It\u00a0 also means that WebGL introduces extra lag since controller plugging/unplugging is slower there.\u00a0 Feel free to play the Online version, but I would HIGHLY recommend downloading it.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game that I've posted anywhere, and my first game that I feel confident saying is finished, and I\u00a0just happened to make it during a game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0I thought I might not do this jam, too, since I couldn't come up with anything, but last night I came up with the idea of unplugging a controller for a mechanic to go with the theme, and I figured I had to at least try, so I started with less than 24 hours left in the jam the next day.</p>\n<p>All art is unoriginal (you're lucky that it is!)
