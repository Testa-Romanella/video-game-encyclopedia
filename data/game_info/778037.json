It... didn't end up quite finished, but I think there's some stuff here that's worth checking out. If nothing else I learned a lot about Godot.</p>\n<p>Your job is to avoid being hit by bullets, and destroying enemies. By default, WASD <br/>moves and ARROW KEYS shoot. You can change this via settings.</p>\n<p>Enemies all have their own behaviours. Some are pretty harmless, but some will shoot at you, or worse. Make use of strategy!</p>\n<p>Getting uncomfortably close to enemies increases your score, but so does killing them very quickly. Best of luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>[ CREDITS ]</strong></p>\n<p>(c) 2022 by futur_null.</p>\n<p>This game uses the following tools and assets, available under various CC licences:</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Godot Engine 3.4.4</p>\n<p>Qurobullet by Quinnvoker: https://github.com/quinnvoker/qurobullet</p>\n<p>Create Mixer by Kenney: https://kenney.itch.io/creature-mixer</p>\n<p>Today Land Retired Characters by TurbografxKid: https://opengameart.org/content/today-land-retired-characters</p>\n<p>NES 8-bit sound effects by shiru8bit: https://opengameart.org/content/nes-8-bit-sound-effects</p>\n<p>The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection [512 sounds] by SubspaceAudio: https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p>\n<p>Car graphics from https://openclipart.org/</p>\n<p>Albatross v2 by Computer Music All-Stars: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Computer_Music_All-Stars/none_given_1781/CMAl...</p>\n<p>Xanadon't by Mystery Mammal: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Mystery_Mammal/latency/Xanadont_1334/</p>\n<p>LATENCY by Mystery Mammal: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Mystery_Mammal/latency/L_A_T_E_N_C_Y_online-a...</p></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:30:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42f/42f8aa1ae25784991f702ba24e1befcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["futur_null"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
