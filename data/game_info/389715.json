{"id": 389715, "slug": "car-crash-10-demo", "name": "Car Crash 1.0 (DEMO)", "name_original": "Car Crash 1.0 (DEMO)", "description": "<p>The game Car Crash 1.0 is a demo version of the game we have built for real-time simulation of car racing. Unlike other racing games, in this car game, players have freedom to free roam and control their own vehicle on their own. Hence, it creates a different adrenaline rush throughout the race. For the version 1.0 we have two cars only Green Car (Player 1) and Red Car (competitor car). In this solo version of SRX, you can race in time trial mode on 10+ tracks. Will you be able to beat our best records? Try and beat every track! (The game is fully translated in French and English)\u00a0 FEATURES: -2 tracks with different difficulties -1 environments -Customizable Audio, Video, Camera, Controls, Mapping and Interface Settings -Saved ghosts, records and settings for future launches\u00a0 CONTROLS: Like the majority of racing games, it is highly recommended to use a gamepad! SRX supports a large majority of gamepads. A Control Mapper is available in game to match your needs for both gamepads and Keyboard / Mouse. Learn how to play directly inside the game through a tutorial.\u00a0\u00a0 SPECS: Low-End PCs (VRAM under 2Go) can run the game but will suffer FPS drops in detailed environments like the Windridge forest. CREDITS: A Game made by Rohan Gupta, Vibhor Jaunsari. More credits inside the game. We are a very small team of developers that worked hard for months to provide the best user experience we could. And this is only the beginning! Our goal is to release a multiplayer version of SRX in the near future, including more tracks, vehicles and game modes.This is a car game developed by Rohan Gupta and Vibhor Jaunsari, students of Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, for our project done under the guidance of our Prof. Natarajan P (Associate Prof. VIT, Vellore).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/892fadb40b95bcbc441910c49b646a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rohanvibhor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
