The great sorcerer has tasked you with retrieving a moon stone, but the moon is far away. You know you read in some tome about a creature of clay which will fulfill any task you set before it, perhaps they can help. <br/></em></p>\n<p>Created in 48 hours for Alakajam 7.<br/><br/><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/>I didn't have enough time to add a tutorial in game, so I wrote it down here. If you are lost, keep reading here.</p>\n<ul><li>You control the small wizard.\u00a0Use\u00a0WASD or\u00a0arrow\u00a0keys to\u00a0move\u00a0or\u00a0select\u00a0an\u00a0action\u00a0from\u00a0the menu on the top\u00a0right.</li><li>When on the same tile as a resource, you can grab one with an action. The trees at ground level, and clay underground are examples of these resources.</li><li>You may discard a held resource if you don't need it.</li><li>While holding a resource, you can build rooms of your tower. After selecting the build button, a new set of buttons will appear with all the rooms you can construct with your held resource. Simply select what you want to build, and a construction site will appear.</li><li>You can drop resources at construction sites or storage sites using a drop action. Once a construction site holds enough resources, which is shown in the UI, it will turn into the desired room.</li><li>After building certain types of rooms, others may become available to construct as well.</li><li>Normal corridors can only get you so far. You need to use more expensive corridors when you get to high altitude.</li><li><strong>Golems are key to the game.</strong> The Golem factory is constructed after a clay storage. Building one will allow you to construct Golems on available squares.</li><li>One a golem is built, it must be programmed. Select the teach action while sharing a space with a golem, then do any actions you wish before returning to the golem, and select Start. The golem will now copy everything you just did until you destroy it. </li><li>A golem will mimic every move whether or not it is successful. Moving in a direction even when it is not legal, will still program the golem with that move. (Could be useful later.)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:10:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc1362d5541b741b0727f3faf666395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kleinzach"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
