It's game over if you run out of food. Your maximum food at any time is 10.</p>\n<p>When you use an item you get spoils from the lake which are added to your deck. The item you just used are discarded.</p>\n<p>When the lake is out of spoils, all used items are reshuffled back into the lake along with some additional trash cards and the game then continues.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a simple game idea I had when I was like 7 or something.</p>\n<p>Cool sprites and icons provided by\u00a0https://game-icons.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T10:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e5358f9acc025d66605614b9dc89c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Parrexion Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
