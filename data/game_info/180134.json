See the time taken in seconds and play again to improve your score.</p><p>Game submitted for Ludum Dare 36 game jam. The unexplainable complexity, size, and precision in constructing The Great Pyramid at Giza (completed around 2560 BC) has led some to conjecture that aliens had a hand in building the pyramids in Giza. This simple action game designed for my preschool grandchildren tests speed and reaction time as they help Orecka The Alien-Sweeper vacuum the Alien Building-Supervisors away from the pyramids. I used Processing.js to make this game. </p><p>Executable versions are provided for all platforms except Android.
