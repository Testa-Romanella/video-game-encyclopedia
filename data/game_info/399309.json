You will be using what you find to upgrade your tools, solve quests, progress through levels and further the story.</p>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome!\r\n<p>We would like to invite you and your friends to play an early version of our game, for free!\u00a0You can help us out by spending a few seconds filling out a quick questionnaire. Your feedback will be\u00a0much appreciated and help make MonsterStone: Prelude a reality!</p>\n<p>Link to the questionnaire:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCEYDwYIITAr4_uia5abOh4pf0PO0PkjV2aFJPfnIXFXh_Kg/viewform</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W,A,S,D - move camera</p>\n<p>Q,E - rotate camera</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - interact with everything<br/></p>\n<p>Scroll wheel - zoom in and out</p>\n<p>X - toggle UI visibility</p>\r\nInspiration For The Concept\r\n<p>The idea came from how games in the idle game genre tend to be the types of games that you \"play to not play\", yet they still have a captivating ability to make us engage with them. Consider MonsterStone: Prelude as an attempt at evolving the genre, by borrowing RPG and strategy game elements to make a more engaging experience. If done right, the result should be an incremental game-like experience, where you feel like you get to play the game, without the need to let it sit idle and wait in order to progress.</p>\r\nCurrent Features\r\n<ul><li>Exploration</li><li>Resource harvesting</li><li>Quests</li><li>Story elements</li><li>Ability to bookmark \u00a05\u00a0levels for revisits</li><li>Secrets</li><li>Tool upgrades</li><li>Production buildings</li><li>Processing buildings</li><li>Various level themes</li><li>Beatable levels</li><li>Save/load progress</li><li>Infinite progression</li><li>Many resource types</li><li>Auto harvesters</li><li>Tier 1 resources, upgrades and enemies</li></ul>\r\nDesirable Future Additions\r\n<p>There are a lot of features that would be great additions to the game, but consider some elements on this list as a suggested direction, rather than a finalized list of guaranteed features.</p>\n<ul><li>Add sounds &amp; music</li><li>Custom character artwork</li><li>Puzzles</li><li>Boss fights</li><li>Profile creation/selection</li><li>Accessibility</li><li>Improved UI interactions</li><li>Game modes (e.g. infinite and story mode)</li><li>Graphics optimizations and settings</li><li>More levels</li><li>Tier 2-&gt;5 resources, upgrades and enemies</li></ul>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>You will likely need a pretty beefy computer if you want to play the game on max settings, turning the settings down when you launch the game might help on lower end systems. We will naturally work on improving this in the future!</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>The game is still in early development, so expect bugs, missing features and little optimization.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T05:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e9c33b8b2aeb8772084514266909080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BendedRules"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
