But how did we get there? And\u00a0why is the sky lava? To understand this we must go back in time, where everything started.</p>\n<p><strong>The playable characters</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The hooded figure:</strong>\u00a0A mysterious individual who is also the last person alive on the planet after the end of times. Tends to be regularly thrown into molten lava whenever the local god is angry, which is all the time.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ADMA:</strong> The very first man.

Be aware that EEV\u00a0Is allergic to solid objects.<br/><br/>\u00a0<strong>ABLE and CNAIN</strong>: The sons of EEV and ADMA. They were both leading very happy lives, until CNAIN absolutely non-accidentally killed his brother. Because of this, CNAIN was condemned by his local god to eternally wander the earth and stay alive until the end of times.<br/></p>\n<strong>MOOS:</strong>\u00a0After many generations, God speaks to a man named\u00a0 ABRACADABRAHM and\u00a0\u00a0makes a promise, or covenant, with him to make his descendants into a great nation and to give them a great land.\u00a0ABRACADABRAHM shows strong faith in God, and God seals his promise with a number of signs and tests.\u00a0This special covenant with God passes on to ABRACADABRAHM\u2019s son, ISAAAAAAAAAAAC, and to his grandson, JACOOB.\u00a0Together, they represent the patriarchs, or fathers, of the ISTHEELITE people.\u00a0JACOOB\u2019s twelve sons move to IJIPT after the youngest brother, JOJO, miraculously becomes a high official in IJIPT. The descendants of JACOOB\u2019s children have become a vast people, but the Pharaoh of IJIPT holds them in slavery.\u00a0God chooses one man, MOOS, to rescue the ISTHEELITES.\u00a0\u00a0Inciting God\u2019s wrath, the ISTHEELITES wander the wilderness for forty years in search of the promised land.\u00a0MOOS continues his legendary leadership and miracles, until his death at the hands of 2TERONOMY.
