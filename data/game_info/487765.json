We wanted to make a game that was just as educational as the original Oregon Trail, but also totally not. Also, don't eat poo. It leads to dysentery and cholera. There. Education. We're still worried it looks like we put a bunch of\u00a0effort into this, but believe me, the biggest effort was withholding effort. Actually, the biggest effort was getting the export to work. I don't even know if you can win this game with all your party alive. Send me a screenshot if you do.. if it's not too much effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Code/Art/Music</strong>:\u00a0halfjapanesedude, lopar,\u00a0lunarpenguin<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pooey Biome: </strong>Award-winning Composer and Developer Laura Shigihara</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts</strong>: Chevy Ray's Pixel Fonts</p>\n<p><strong>Engine:\u00a0</strong>godot<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Effort:\u00a0</strong>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T06:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2db28123bd964ac29dd2862988ffde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lopar"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
