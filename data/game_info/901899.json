In the demo you can interact with the two characters to get one of three random dialogues. I made this project in under 30 minutes using the tools and scriptable objects I created for my dialogue system. This system is made to be scalable and will be incorporated into a quest system that I am also working on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the screenshot you can see the interface for creating and editing dialogues. It is simple and easy to work with, but also allows the user control over every detail.</p>\n<p>This system\u00a0is the first step in my task list for a game I am working on. The next step is completing a modular quest system that incorporates this dialogue system. Then I will work on the turn based combat system and finally inventory, crafting,\u00a0and gathering systems. The final game will be a Terraria and Pokemon inspired collectathon where the player collects weapons, materials,\u00a0armor, pets, and accessories\u00a0to slay monsters through turn based combat.</p><p><em>All artwork in this demo is\u00a0from free asset packs</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T07:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/230cb2bf14513d4e09d10806c91a47a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrRan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
