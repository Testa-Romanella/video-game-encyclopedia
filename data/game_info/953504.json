Don't worry, you don't need to play the previous games to play this one (this game is objectively the best one). Thanks for playing this game and/or downloading it.</p>\n<p>While none of the\u00a0<em>Red</em> games are realated, they are all fun in my opinion. They are also very different from each other and have come a long way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>- Use arrow keys or wasd to move</p>\n<p>- Avoid the Red Razor-Blades</p>\n<p>- Point and click with your mouse to shoot your gun</p>\n<p>- In between waves, you can talk to the shopkeeper</p>\n<p>- When you a Deadshot (the fastest red blade) it will drop blue scraps</p>\n<p>- Sell those scraps to get money and play for upgrades or armour</p>\n<p>- The only way to get past a wave is to first kill the three Deadshots, and then kill whatever is left</p>\n\n<p><strong>List of Razor-Blade Types:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>Thorns</strong> are the smallest type, they slide down the screen at random</p>\n<p>- <strong>Reapers</strong> are the second smallest. These guys track your x position and slide down towards you</p>\n<p>- <strong>Gurderers</strong> are the square-shaped type, they move slow and bounce off the walls</p>\n<p>- <strong>Arrowheads</strong> look like, well, arrowheads. They follow you around like heat-seeking missiles,\u00a0but\u00a0don't worry, they\u00a0are very slow</p>\n<p>- <strong>Deadshots</strong> are the fastest Razor-Blades, they drop scraps when they die and take a ton of bullets to defeat. Every wave they get stronger and stronger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Created on April 3rd of 2023 by Calvin Art Games</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T15:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a279e602be8f8e03d35a09b1577100ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calvin Art Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
