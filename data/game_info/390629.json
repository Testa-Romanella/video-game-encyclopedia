Drive up and down the mountain, picking up and dropping off gods every stop.</p>\n<p>The rules of the road:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The trip takes seven hours. One way.</li><li>The bus pulls to to the right a little bit, so no falling asleep at the wheel!</li><li>If the bus drives into the grass it will break down and you'll lose the game. It's not a very sturdy bus.</li><li>Once you pick up some gods from the top of the mountain you will go back down and drop them off at the bottom. Do this as many times as you want! Every time you reach the top or bottom of the mountain you get one point.</li><li>Bus is controlled with the W (move up) and S (move down)\u00a0keys. Space bar starts the bus after it's stopped.</li><li>That's it! Have fun.</li></ul>\n<p>This is an entry to Desert Bus Game Jam 2019, and as such is an homage to the game <em>Desert Bus</em>!</p><p>(TODO: I will be adding a simple credits screen for the various assets I used, I just wanted to get the submission in before the jam deadline!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d738c81fc88aa0a0ee3c76bbdbf467c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mantis-Eye Labs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
