It's name is TeleSnow and it is created, by only me QCKids. The goal of the game is simply to find the teleport located in the map. You might think this is easy... Not really. The teleport is invisible which makes it soo difficult to find. Also, if you fall in one of the traps, guess what.. your are eliminated. You will then have to restart from the beginning. Once you have found the 3 teleport, I will be proud to announce.. you have WON the game!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The textures have been done with Quixel Mixer and everything else was made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:49:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e6211b697964e5e6b0a1413dcc6f6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QCkids"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
