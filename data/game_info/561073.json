You are equipped with two weapons. The Zombie Killer is a high-damage, no-nosense weapon that will make short work of the hungry foes. Use this weapon to get out of a pinch! The Zombie Converter does less damage than the Killer, but upon killing a Zombie with it, it will convert that zombie back into a human to join you in your fight! Use this weapon to convert Zombies and gather up an army\u00a0to assist you. Although these allies don't hit as hard, they copy whichever gun you're using, and with enough of them, you can easily mow down swarms of Zombies.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678664baab953588204346b039da91fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nat15861"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
