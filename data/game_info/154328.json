The theme of the jam is\u00a0<strong>dual purpose design</strong> -- the use of game mechanics which serve at least two purposes.</p>\r\nDashdance uses a single mechanic for both combat and mobility: the dash.\r\n<p>Dashing to enemies pulls your character towards them, but then also knocks them back into the air. You must combo dashes and double jumps to juggle enemies across the stage, launching them (and yourself) higher and higher. But be careful -- kill an enemy without juggling them into the right position and you may find yourself stuck...</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys to move, click to dash (if you're close enough)</li><li>Every dash restores your double jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/86461d783dc68e8b356a87bf0000d706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["excalo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
