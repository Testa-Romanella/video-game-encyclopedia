It's a very simple design, and doesn't bring anything new to the concept, but it's a nice distraction and my largest project to date.</p>\n<p>To play, click the desired unit's icon on the bottom of the screen, and then click again to place the unit on the map. Hover of the units' icons for a brief description.</p>\n<p>Project created from\u00a0www.gamedev.tv's 2D Platformer course. I expanded the Lane Defender design to include my own assets, effects, music, functionality and corrected some bugs that lingered in the course's design.</p>\n<p>Music by Greisinger</p>\n<p>Sound Effects from 3rd Note Studio\u00a0(From Unity Asset Store)<br/>Character Sprites from <strong>Game Character Hub: Portfolio Edition</strong><br/>Barrier and Background from <strong>Dungeon Painter Studio\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cbaf951cf8f06834418eb876e9536b69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nebbers"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
