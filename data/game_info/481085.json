{"id": 481085, "slug": "lil-witch-wip", "name": "Lil Witch WIP", "name_original": "Lil Witch WIP", "description": "<p>This is a currently untitled game I started at a game jam in March and decided to finish last week. It's a quasi-visual-novel about a little witch who starts an apprenticeship in hopes of earning a new cat! Tarot cards between each scene (aka the witch's morning reading) determine the story outcomes.<br/>I have a lot left to do in terms of making the UI manageable and, you know, writing the thing, but I have come so far in the past week so I really want to show off my progress! It ... actually works.</p>\n<p>\"You are a little witch who really wants a familiar! You were talking to your friend Pod, who runs the local apothecary shop, about how much you\u2019d like a new kitten. He needs some help around the shop these days, and offered you a unique proposition. If you work at the shop with him this week, he\u2019ll think about giving you a full time apprenticeship to start saving up for your cat. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe he\u2019ll even help you find one!</p>\n<p>This game will take you through your week long trial period. Every morning, your daily tarot reading will set the tone for your day, and every night you\u2019ll reflect on how your day went. All you\u2019ll need is your mouse or trackpad; simply left click to interact. May fortune be in your favor!\"</p><p>Follow production at\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/mdecapuaart/\u00a0or\u00a0https://twitter.com/doubledogdaria</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/8817a800fee0e24065bc4c81c9b67ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doubledogdaria"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
