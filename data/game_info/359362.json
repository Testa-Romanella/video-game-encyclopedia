{"id": 359362, "slug": "end-of-realms", "name": "End of Realms", "name_original": "End of Realms", "description": "What would happen if the first swashbuckling, fantasy, adventure and dungeon-crawling PC titles, were inspired by board games rather than tabletop RPG? What would they look like? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe don't know, but we decided to make a game that reaches for those inspirations now.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnd of Realms is a turn based RPG (of sorts) where the core mechanism of travel and interacting with the world is inspired by classic fantasy board games. The kind where you roll a die, go one of two ways and your character finds something interesting based on where he landed. A sword? A monster? A magical contraption? Maybe something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCombine that with a very simple turn based combat, painterly graphics and a plot of 70-something pages told in comic book captions, voila, what you get is End of Realms.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is a passion project made by 2 people, with a number of hired helpers at various stages of development. It is 100%, freshly squeezed, indie. If you decide to buy it, the money will go directly to the people who made it and help support our future, bigger, better and equally original projects.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d89d2d9bfa663514012924eadc5115.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Marcin Jarkiewicz"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Marcin Jarkiewicz"], "esrb_rating": null}
