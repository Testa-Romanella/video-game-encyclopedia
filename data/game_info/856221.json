You can play basketball as a monkey. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe locomotion is inspired by Gorilla Tag. You can run, jump, and control the ball using only your hands. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe rules are the same as basketball. There are single mode and multiplayer mode. You could not only play with bots, but also play with other players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is easy to play, but hard to master. It maybe helps to actually play basketball.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T04:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f7129fc1c9ebd72c52f61a649aa224ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fengu Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Fengu Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
