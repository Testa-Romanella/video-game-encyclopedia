The game is inspired by the games:</p>\n<p>- RE:RUN</p>\n<p>- Karlson (free version)</p>\n<p>- Grapple</p>\n<p>The game is not very detailed however, it is playable. Because of this, it is free, but donations are\u00a0accepted (when it will be available)\u00a0for further projects that I wish to add to steam, to make it more fun to play by implementing features as inventory with the help of the steam inventory system, or using steam networking to make multiplayer in further games. More information will be on my channel later.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music by: DeepMusicEveryDay on Pixabay</p>\n<p>Character controller and grappling remote made by DaniDev</p>\n<p>If any of you have problems with using your code or music, please do not hesitate contacting me at zsombiistudios@gmail.com.\u00a0</p>\n<p>PLEASE REMEMBER!\u00a0Spam will be ignored.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e14c6d6fc075250581cbe49b3283d1a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ZSOMBIISTUDIOS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
