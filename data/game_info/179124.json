While playing during testing it took a minute to get the hang of this aspect, but since there isn't a time restraint while you contemplate your next move you can really think it out.</em></p><p>- MajorGeeks</p><p>If you have any suggestions or feedback, it'd be awesome to hear from you, and if you do find any bugs, I'll try fix them as soon as possible if you let me know.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be9c7a72e518d89cf78a5bc5d3e7003e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Hunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
