And it's un finnished, mainly because I\u00a0know nothing about game making and, as\u00a0I\u00a0discovered soon after starting to work on the game,\u00a0the Novelty engine is not the thing I\u00a0needed to accomplish everything I\u00a0wanted for the game.\u00a0 The other reason, is that , although I\u00a0feel myself pretty confident at wrighting in general, my\u00a0English is not very good, so I'll need somebody to edit all that stuff.</p>\n<p>For the moment I\u00a0decided to leave this project and make something simpler for a while. Maybe, I'll just cut off some intended game mechanics and continue with Novelty engine...</p>\n<p>Also if you feel like you want to help me with the project in any way, feel free to contact me.</p>\n<p>P.S.: The pencil does nothing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d3808901f76acc3d95cba8b18ac18a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inco-Nito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
