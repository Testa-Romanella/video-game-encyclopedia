Had a great time making it. I have uploaded an updated version at here, Dragon Road that is not for Ludum Dare but as a separate game. That's for checking it out. If you would like to follow the development please consider following me on itch. Any suggestions for a name would be appreciated. I'd appreciate if you would check out my youtube channel, here. I will take any suggestions into account for the game expanded from this one. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f2341ac9bcebc9be6f624887c72bce1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BitConnect"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
