Where as the old version was based off spawning prefabs, this version has a list of walls, doors and floors that it can use to generate rooms from. This gives it a much more varied feel to each room. Rooms can now also be different sizes, not just 1x1 like in v1. There will only be 1 door from a room to another room regardless of the size, no rooms will have 2 doors next to each other that lead to the same place.</p><p>If you wish to read about the creation of this project, that can be found here:\u00a0https://medium.com/@maddisonben343/exploring-procedural-generation-in-levels-3a6...</p>\n<p>Summary Advantages over V1:<br/></p>\n<p>-Greater Variety of room layouts due to random part selection</p>\n<p>-Easier to add new parts to get more rooms</p>\n<p>-Different sized rooms</p>\n<p>-Faster code to generate level</p>\n<p>-Stops much sooner when max room value is reached</p>\n<p>-Top down camera mode to view level</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80da376efe1dcf0223df6bf5f66eb522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Asmondia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
