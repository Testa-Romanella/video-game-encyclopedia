The theme was Upside Down so i created this game, and its made within 14 hours that means the last day of the jam, so it might be crappy but it still fun to play. The game is simple, Camera turns upside down after every 6 seconds and you have to survive as long as you can.</p>\r\nHow i made this game?\r\n<p>Well i use buildbox for this game as i create most of the games in it.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Assets by: Kenney</p>\n<p>Music By : Me</p>\n<p>SFX by: Also me</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for trying if you tried!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5b/b5b68022943825cdd377bb5ac4e7ec0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdilDevStuff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
