I started using the basics of visual scripting and slowly I used more intermediate and advanced scripting to finalise the development of Bridge Builder.\u00a0 To convert C# code to visual scripting was a challenge a first, for example, understanding loops, collections, events, debug and fixing errors, understanding the difference between state and script machine. However, it was crucial to minimise my control nodes inside visual scripting and learn almost every variable type from start to finish to create a bridge-building game was fun to do because part of my\u00a0passion for making games is\u00a0to find methods but effective to solving problems, just like this game!</p><p>Controls: Click and drag left mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/832a69c36f25cfece44a92707e6a5cc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
