The setting of this game is inspired by 2009 Japanese arcade game\u00a0<em>Super Table Flip</em>\u00a0(\u8d85\u30fb\u3061\u3083\u3076\u53f0\u8fd4\u3057) in which a low table is slammed and subsequently thrown into the air. Camera and water surface shake is achieved using random perturbations to a spring &amp; damper model popular in mechanical engineering, while a mix of vignetting and chromatic abberation are used to add detail to the scene. The background used is a photo of\u00a0<em>Izakaya Tomo</em>\u00a0(Edmonton, Alberta;\u00a0credits).</p>\n<p>Open source.
