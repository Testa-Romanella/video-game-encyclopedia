{"id": 672350, "slug": "redux-2", "name": "Redux", "name_original": "Redux", "description": "Redux is a top-down 2D puzzle game where you are recorded solving puzzles and must destroy past versions of yourself before they can finish. You will need to think in many timelines at once, working with your past and future selves to solve 50 diabolical challenges. Each increasingly complex puzzle teaches you more about this web of timelines, never giving information away but always keeping the solution within reach.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRedux includes nonlinear progression and an open world, so there are always things to do if you get stuck on a puzzle. You can make progress on your mission hacking into a rebellion\u2019s network of computers, or you can explore your compound and discover its secrets. You can even speedrun puzzles and track your best times, requiring careful planning, timing, and skill.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/273d8803d6ed5a5dd8ea51a17450906d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["-Yodasaurus- Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["-Yodasaurus- Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
