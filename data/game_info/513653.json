The game has a ghost and a couple of allusions to death.<br/><br/>The idea of a ghost whose reaction to you depends on how you treat it and a couple scenes in this game were loosely inspired by The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T02:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c994e45d8b08e658ca4af7627216b58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seaphoenix"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SeaPhoenix"], "esrb_rating": null}
