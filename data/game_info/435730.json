I was aware about\u00a0<strong>Ludum Dare</strong>\u00a0for a long time, but I never participated in it. That changed this weekend\u00a0\u00a0! I finally decided to give this event a go and to try to develop a game in Unity! I have messed around with Unity before, but I never managed to \u201cproduce\u201d something. That changed today as I\u2019ve just \u201cfinished\u201d my first \u201cgame\u201d in it -&gt;\u00a0<strong>Keep E.T Alive</strong>.</p>\n<p>So as name of the game suggest I\u00a0<strong>followed</strong>\u00a0the idea of the\u00a0<strong>theme</strong>\u00a0\u2026 perhaps too much\u00a0. E.T has returned from his home planet back to Earth. He realized that he is missing some of the finest things from Earth - such as\u00a0<em>Beer</em>\u00a0or\u00a0<em>Meat</em>. But he is very exhausted from the trip so you need to keep him alive! Feed him, don\u2019t let him be thirsty and also clean after him. He may occasionally start to bleed as he is adjusting to earthly atmosphere again, so take care of that too!</p>\n\n<p>Few\u00a0<strong>Notes</strong>\u00a0from my development process:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Graphics</strong>\u00a0- First I wanted to go with pixel-art, but I quickly realized that I will not have time for it as I\u2019m not very - good at drawing it (it\u2019s something I definitely want to improve on in future). So I decided for super fast solution -&gt; MS Paint. All Sprites were drawn with it, hardest part was E.T itself as I had to combine different shapes, in different angles and sizes. I used GIMP for adding transparent layers.</li><li><strong>Code</strong>\u00a0- In my professional life I am front-end React developer so when I realized that I can just use VSCode I was super happy! I set up few things, configured some extensions and I started coding right away! I learned a lot as this was basically my first project in Unity (they made their docs really easy to read). One thing that helped me a lot was plugin iTween recommended by a friend.</li><li><strong>Audio</strong>\u00a0- This might have been my favorite part. I laughed whole time as I was creating and editing those sound effects. Good thing that I had that beer in fridge and also duck tape.</li></ul>\n<p>Things that I would\u00a0<strong>improve or change</strong>: Biggest problem was the time. There are a couple of things that I really wanted to add to the game but I just didn\u2019t have time.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Animations</strong>\u00a0for E.T - right now E.T looks super blunt and it worsens overall feeling from the game. I wanted to add expressions to his face when beer was close to his Infusion or face of guilt when he would poop himself.</li><li>Another\u00a0<strong>Need</strong>\u00a0for E.T - there was a plan to add one more item iPhone with airpods. Player would have to give E.T airpods to both ears and then start song on iPhone (it would also change game sound loop) and than when E.T would have enough of listening, remove them and stop the song.</li><li>Better\u00a0<strong>music</strong>\u00a0- game sound loops were the last things I worked on and it shows. I used this web app\u00a0https://beepbox.co/\u00a0to create some songs but I am really not happy with outcomes. I felt like my head wanted to explode at some point.</li></ol>\n<p>Overall I am super happy that I did this. I learned a lot, got nice experience and mainly it was\u00a0<strong>super fun</strong>. I definitely will try next Ludum Dare! Heck, I might start working on some other game in meanwhile just because I might feel like it!</p>\n<p>Downloads and Links<br/>Source Code<br/>https://github.com/Saviqq/Keep-E.T-Alive</p>\n<p>Windows version<br/>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MliBZHYoRt6_0qUSep0wZbs0Inbyevwi/view?usp=sharing<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b345bc0b90119fee43746f3485e7937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saviqq"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
