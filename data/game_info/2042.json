Initially, the game was developed on Adobe Flash but was later ported to Facebook as an app.</p>\n<h3>Director&#39;s Cut features</h3>\n<p>In the Director&#39;s Cut, the players are able to create a completely new character instead of choosing from the presets. Randomized zombie spawns, boss encounters, and achievements were also added to the game. The original game was described as a parody on the educational game named The Oregon Trail, while the Director&#39;s Cut should be considered as a new title that pushes the concept of its source.</p>\n<p>While the original game was free-to-play, the players have to buy the Director&#39;s Cut in order to play it.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to reach a zombie-free haven. In order to do so, the main character has to cross The United States in his old wagon. It is essential to manage food, water, ammunition, and car fuel in order to survive and arrive at your destination. Do not forget to take care of your party, by the way.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, the players have to either choose a preset character or create a new one. It is possible to choose from a cop, a lawyer or just a clerk. Every character has their own upsides and downsides. For example, while playing as a cop, the player will be able to search for supplies for a little longer, but the overall score will be smaller after beating the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T18:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c493b8ec38ee62ba50a3a3da1266ca.jpeg", "website": "http://www.hatsproductions.com/organtraildc/", "rating": 3.37, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 1139, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 36, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 92, "platforms": ["Linux", "Android", "iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Men Who Wear Many Hats"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Men Who Wear Many Hats"], "esrb_rating": null}
