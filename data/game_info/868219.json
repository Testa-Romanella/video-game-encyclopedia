It's also known as Court Piece, Rang or Rung, Seven Hands, and Hok. The game is similar to Troefcall, Single Sar, Double Sar, and Satat.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first team to reach a number of preset points. H\u00e2kem (\u00abruler, governor\u00bb) has the benefit of declaring the trump suit. Each player gets 13 cards. Within each suit, the cards rank from highest to lowest value is A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.<br/><br/>H\u00e2kem leads to the first trick. Each player in turn must follow suit. If a player holds no cards of the suit led, that player may play any card (including any trump card). The highest card in the trump suit always wins the trick. If no trump cards are played, the trick goes to the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next. The first team to take 7 tricks wins the hand and scores 1 point.<br/><br/>Get the app now and start playing!<br/><br/>You can find more information on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/playhokm", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T06:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df6aa8f2a23dbd2e44690e706ffae92_rW61yTN.jpg", "website": "https://www.conectagames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Web2mil.com"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Web2mil"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
