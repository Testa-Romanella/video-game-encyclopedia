Play with either of two different characters: \r\n            Rachel Riveter, who's gun shoots streams of rivets, and Demolition \r\n            Ralph, who's love for explosions really helps him out of some tight \r\n            spots against seven different alien creatures. And if you've got a \r\n            friend around, pull up a gamepad and have them help you clean out \r\n            the aliens! </p>\n<p>Derelict was originally released in 2004, and this version has been updated to work around various issues that came up between then and now. Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd033356a7867fbf2022e923e4b80410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laughing Dragon Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
