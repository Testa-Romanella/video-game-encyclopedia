Collect star bits to increase your score. The game will loop when you complete it. Go for the highest score you can!</p>\n<p>Can be played with a controller or keyboard. Shift key jumps, up down left and right to move.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is inspired by single screen arcade action games like Donkey Kong, Jumpman, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure.<br/>I'm planning on updating with a speedrun mode, which will play through the levels once and give you a final time (instead of looping until you die). Please look forward to it.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/>Artwork by me, Toad64 <br/>with the exception of the ladders, which I believe are from Kenny.nl</p>\n<p>Music<br/>Penguin Town by Three Red Hearts<br/>Princess Quest by Three Red Hearts<br/>Penultimate by Three Red Hearts<br/>The Graveyard (LOOP) by Bit By Bit<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a85/a854ac629252f972a602244fb28b6024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toad64"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
