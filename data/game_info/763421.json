And while the release details were being prepared, I created an extra mode for the release version: QUORDLE!</p>\n<p>Now this is only a stand-alone prototype and only has a few puzzles in, as well as no stats/quordle highlighting for the 4 words; and I still need to iron out a few bugs...</p>\n<p>But I thought I would release it to make the wait for the cart release more bearable!</p>\n<p>Controls are pretty much the same as NES Quordle, and of course, Family BASIC is supported :)</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun with Quordle for now, and see you in the final release.
