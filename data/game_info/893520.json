Your suspects are a duo of bunny magicians due to their strange behavior recently. Now by what\u00a0<strong>YOU</strong>\u00a0choose to figure out the murderer you can either save the circus or leave the murderer loose!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was a school project I had to get done within 5 weeks. It might look a bit unpolished, but<strong> I might return afterwards and fix up &amp; add up more stuff to it.</strong> I am a highschooler after all and I am really busy with schoolwork at the moment! My classmates are very excited on the game though, so I hope they enjoy it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks to my silly mom and my friend Lunascathwolf for play testing the game for me!!! Along with many other people for support and play testing! :D</p>\n<p>(Point &amp; click murder mystery game basically)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T07:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9cd7fecd90dfedb6543323f4f37fdc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LoafDY"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
