' is a concept that turned into a complete game made by one of our teammates at the beginning of the Spring 2018 semester at the Academy of Art, for a Prototype Game Development class. We are a group of 3 students, 2 Game Designers and 1 Modeler;\u00a0we teamed up and communicate to create in 5 weeks part of what we are showing here. Based on feedback provided by students after an internal and an external playtest, we modified the project based on found bugs, suggestions made by testers, and adding/ improving what they most liked about our game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TEAM:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Duy Phan -<em> System Designer, Scripter.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Alberto Guerra - <em>Level Designer.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Neil Banez - <em>Prop Artist.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1be723b5462ad29e14149eeadb55098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alberto Guerra"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
