Heres the prompt!</p>\n<p>\"<strong>\u00a0</strong>PROFICIENCY TEST v1.2 (Unity)</p>\n<p><strong>Game - Pick Bonus</strong></p>\n<p>A common bonus round in many slot/casino styled games is a Pick Bonus. This type of \u201cmini-game\u201d allows the player to pick from a finite number of objects that will each have the\u00a0possibility of awarding a varying amount of money. The player continues to pick until a\u00a0\u201cPooper\u201d is selected, which in this case is an empty chest, and that would end the bonus round\u00a0(and the turn in this case). In this exercise, you will create a simple rendition of this, while\u00a0managing money and denomination.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Elements</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Play Button - this button will start each Play.</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cCurrent Denomination\u201d Readout - The current money that will be \u201cbet\u201d each Play.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Denomination Increase / Decrease Buttons - this will change the Current Denomination.</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cCurrent Balance\u201d Readout - Shows the Current Balance.</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cLast Game Win\u201d Readout - Shows the amount won on the previous turn.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Treasure Chests - The objects the player will pick to reveal prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Play Button &amp; Denomination Buttons must be greyed out / disabled during each Play.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Increase and Decrease Buttons for adjusting denomination (which updates \u201cCurrent\u00a0Denomination\u201d Readout).</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cCurrent Balance\u201d readout</p>\n<p>o Starts on $10.00.</p>\n<p>o Denomination should be subtracted each Play Button press.</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201cLast Game Win\u201d Readout</p>\n<p>o Starts on $0.00 and resets to $0.00 on every Play Button Press</p>\n<p>\u2022 9 (3x3) Pickable Treasure Chests</p>\n<p>o Pickable after pressing Play</p>\n<p>o When picked</p>\n<p>1- Show Open Treasure Chest</p>\n<p>2- Display money in that chest (if any)</p>\n<p>3-\u00a0Add money to the running total in the \u201cLast Game Win\u201d Readout</p>\n<p>4-\u00a0 Become No longer clickable</p>\n<p>\u2022 After the Pooper is picked, add the total won to the \u201cCurrent Balance\u201d Readout.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Reset Treasures Chests / Visuals on every Play Button Press.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Disable play button whenever denomination is greater than remaining balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Denomination has four possible values: $0.25, $0.50, $1.00, $5.00.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Valid win multipliers:</p>\n<p>1-\u00a0 0x (instant loss) - 50% of the time.</p>\n<p>2-\u00a0 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x - one of these 30% of the time.</p>\n<p>3-\u00a0 12x, 16x, 24x, 32x, 48x, 64x - one of these 15% of the time.</p>\n<p>4-\u00a0 100x, 200x, 300x, 400x, 500x - one of these 5% of the time.</p>\n<p>\u2022 On pressing the play button, one of the multipliers should be randomly selected with the\u00a0appropriate frequency specified above.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Now you\u2019ll need to figure out the best way to split the total win (given by multiplying the\u00a0denomination by the multiplier selected) into smaller win amounts. Remember, at least 1\u00a0chest must be reserved for the Pooper which means you can only use up to 8 for the win\u00a0amounts.</p>\n<p>\u2022 This is not a \u201crandom game\u201d however so, for example, if you decide to have win amounts\u00a0of $0.50 and $2.00 to give a total win of $2.50 then no matter which chest the player\u00a0picks first it will contain a $0.50 win and the second one picked will contain the $2.00.\u00a0The third one picked will be the Pooper. The chests that the player picks do not matter,\u00a0it\u2019s all predetermined and the chests are simply a way to deliver the win values to the\u00a0player.</p>\n<p>\u2022 All win amounts should be no less than $0.05 increments (e.g. $2.45, $0.70, $12.55).</p>\n<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Any graphics can be used.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Any flare is nice, like tweens (using DOTween) on win amounts or anticipation on</p>\n<p>\u201cTreasure chests\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Any other creative liberties are encouraged.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Imagine playing the game with your own money. If you\u2019re excited to be opening the\u00a0chests, you\u2019re probably on the right track. If you\u2019re frustrated, bored, or confused when\u00a0opening chests then you may want to re-think your algorithms. \"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T13:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d939610298f0dfa611318f6c096d1251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NightModeGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
