General Mechos, a powerful military leader of the humans launched an attack on the floating islands and abducted the dragoness Crystal for reasons unknown.<br/></em><br/></p>\n<p><em> Flame, a trainee knight and Crystal's best friend, travels to the forgotten kingdom of Mineria having sworn to find her and put an end to whatever plot General Mechos has planned. On his journey, Flame will face incredible dangers, discover more about the kingdom of Mineria, why the dragons were separated from the earth to live in the sky, and discover his own destiny.</em></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This is \u00a0a WIP game that started out as a simple project for a class, but I loved working on it so much I expanded it into what will be my first indie game! It's inspired by games such as Shovel Knight, Zelda 2, and Megaman. I recently started my first nine-to-five job and I'm the sole developer, but it's my passion project so I'm working on it regularly when I'm able ^^ I hope you all will enjoy!<br/><br/>KEYBOARD CONTROLS:<br/></p><p>Jump/use/confirm - Z</p>\n<p>Attack 1/Cancel - X</p>\n<p>Attack 2 - C</p>\n<p>Dodge - Space bar</p>\n<p>Duck - Down arrow</p>\n<p>Move - Left and right arrows</p>\n<p>Slide - Down + Space bar</p>\n<p>Climb/talk/read - up arrow</p>\n<p>Pause - Enter<br/></p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p><p>* Sometimes the skeleton enemies will get embedded in walls<br/><br/>* Some users are experiencing issues where their game-pads are unresponsive.
