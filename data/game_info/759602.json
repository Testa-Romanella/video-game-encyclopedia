When you are defeated, your deck and progress is reset, but you can achieve permanent progression through card unlocks and new player generals.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Defeat enemy armies</strong><br/>Strategically control a battlefield of 16 cards where the placement of each card affects its synergies with the surrounding cards. Go up against an enemy army with health and attack values, and you have your own health, defense, attack, and wealth values which impact your battles with the enemy army. Additionally, you choose a player general which gives you a unique option for how you manipulate your cards. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Other features</strong><br/>Collect 30+ treasure items whenever an army is deafted; these treasures further solidify the card synergies which exist in your deck or allow you to pivot to new strategies. A key component of the game is the \"Faction Synergy\" which triggers whenever you have a full row or column of cards from the same faction. After the first army, enemy armies will begin to add sabotage cards to your deck which negatively impact your cards when they are played on the field.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T04:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006669a48d8d7e216dfca2e6b6d7e6b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mandaw2014", "Bleem"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bleem"], "esrb_rating": null}
