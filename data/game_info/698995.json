A strange metal cabinet has fallen through the ceiling from the apartment above, effectively blocking his front door. The night life of the town goes on, oblivious to Henri&#39;s struggles as he tries to solve his predicament, perhaps not completely on his own.</p>\n<p>The night is going to be long and peculiar...</p>\n<p>Blank Frame focuses on atmosphere and story instead of constantly startling the player with cheap and unnecessary jump scares. Blank Frame is meant mainly for fans of slow paced surreal/psychological horror games and classic horror films.</p>\n<p>The night will take the average player about an hour and a half to two hours to play through on your first attempt and is meant to be played entirely in one sitting. The game contains two endings that can be achieved individually depending on your choices throughout.</p>\n<p>Game play is a combination of point and click and walking simulators with a dark and psychological tone.
