Progression is score-based, so players will need to increase their scores to unlock new songs. Each song has three modes of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard, that should provide players of all skill levels with a challenge and the ability to earn points for the purchase of talents; more points are awarded as the difficulty increases. Forget about memorization: Rhythmic Keyboard uses procedurally generated key letters/timing, so each experience is unique, making the player rely more on reaction speed as well as hand/eye coordination. <br/><br/>If the included songs become unappealing/repetitive, but you would like to continue typing using most (no points earned during custom song gameplay) of Rhythmic Keyboard's features, then you can select music (<strong>MP3</strong>, <strong>WAV</strong>, and <strong>OGG Vorbis</strong> supported) from your personal collection, to be used during gameplay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T04:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d9503c742aec4ee2e9b41cec2591cd64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lando Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lando Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
