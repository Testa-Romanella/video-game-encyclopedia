Or, Uhh... You. Can get sleep tonight. This game features 2 parts. A shooter mode. Where bad memories represent red, broken down picture frames, and good memories represent white, normal picture frames. The bad memories will go away instantly if you shoot them, but if you let them go all the way to the bottom, you'll lose HP.\u00a0 Good memories won't help you either. You can't hurt them! If you shoot one, the bullet will just bounce right back at you and hit you, so watch out!</p>\n<p>The 2nd part is a sort of running game. You have to jump or groundpound to avoid platforms, all while trying to defeat the bad memories that represent red picture frames with wings!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can either use a Keyboard or an Xbox\u00a0Controller (You can actually use any controller to play, but this guide is specifically for Xbox controllers) to play the game.
