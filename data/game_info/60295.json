{"id": 60295, "slug": "oknormal", "name": "OK/NORMAL", "name_original": "OK/NORMAL", "description": "<strong>OK/NORMAL</strong> is a short, experimental third-person horror experience, inspired by early 3D console games of the 90's.  Journey through a dark, disjointed, dreamlike dimension with your cloud companion! Remember a good diet, take your medicine, and you should be fine!<br/><br/>Technically OK/NORMAL imitates the capabilities of the original PlayStation as closely as possible, including, but not limited to, affine texture mapping, vertex snapping and low polygon 3D models. Though, unlike most PS1 games, OK/NORMAL does run at 60fps, for an visually accurate, yet more fluid gameplay experience.<br/><br/>The game is a short, linear experience, that runs for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes depending on your playstyle. I recommend taking your time to look around and listening to the chatter your companion provides!<br/><br/>The game is highly recommended to be played through in one sitting, but it does save between each level, so if you have to run, you can just pick up where you left off!<br/><br/><br/><strong>WARNING: This game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T11:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/927/9276cc7e71218ac91a18103a19f1b440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 83, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["98DEMAKE"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["98DEMAKE"], "esrb_rating": null}
