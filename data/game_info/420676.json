It's my first game jam like this, and I'm unfamiliar with some of the tech that I'll be using, but I'm excited to have the chance to sit down and dedicate time to working on completing a good project! I'm definitely looking forward to the finished build.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam was the open-ended \"a lot of.\" My first ideas were maybe a Katamari Dynasty-like game or maybe some gardening/weeding game, but I ultimately decided\u00a0on the idea of \"anarchy\" from Twitch Plays Pokemon. As TPP showed, even a simple game where the player can move around can be complicated by errant inputs, so I felt like a game where the player combatted similar inputs (albeit generated by the computer) could provide an interesting, non-traditional game experience that could feasibly be made in the span of just three days. (Well, there are plenty of things that could have been better, but at least I made something playable in time!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5bef5cea91736df51fe5814ab3a6b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael-Belland"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
