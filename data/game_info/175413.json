The theme for this one was \"Single-Stick Slapper\" so I made this first person 2D slapping game using the Godot engine. Use WASD to slap and Arrows to block incoming slaps. If you slap the enemy in a certain *secret* combo, they'll take extra damage! For the lazy who can't figure out what that combo is, you can find the source code here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c075bc025b79d7b62bd2c2e6ff4eb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CrazyGuy108"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
