A ridiculous visual novel with turn-based battles, decision branches based on player choices, romance, drama and lots of fun things to play and unlock... <br/><br/><br/>The world is on the brink of destruction. The treaties of the past have failed. Tensions brew as the Europa powers prepare themselves for war. The young dictators of the continent find themselves drawn into battle...<br/><br/>Yamato Yamamoto, a disillusioned but brave soldier from the Empire of Zipangu, is sent on a secret mission to spy on the F\u00fc\u00fchbar of Germania.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Can Yamato handle these deceptive, towering figures of history - the cruel Adorofia Hitora of Germania, the sly Gallia Cyrano of the Republic of Franzo, the bold Winstefina Churchill of the Empire of Britannia, the lazy Benita Mussorinni of the Empire of Vitalia, and the devilish Iosefina Starin of the Union of Sovia? <br/><br/>Will his mission be a success? Or will the world be plunged into further tyranny and darkness? The clock is ticking as the continent sleepwalks to its doom...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most of the game utilizes a traditional visual novel format, where the player clicks to advance the story and makes choices. These choices determine the ending you get. As you play and interact with characters, you unlock character CGs and other artwork, as well as music tracks, that can be accessed from the bonus screen in the main menu. The game features three campaigns in the main story, as well as two side stories. These are accessed from the Campaigns screen at specific points in the game, and an additional prequel game can be played after completing the main game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>During the game, the player is assigned missions. Prior to beginning missions, a player will enter the map screen, where you can find all kinds of information relevant to upcoming battles, as well as the plot.

From this screen, you can choose to play Side Missions ahead of a Main Mission each time, to build experience and unlock extras.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game features turn-based pixel-art battles as part of the missions. There's a good mixture of real-world fighting, tanks and weapons, as well as magical attacks and special skills. Fight on to win in order to continue the story, as well as to unlock extras. For players solely interested in advancing the story, you can skip these battles in Easy mode...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prior to battles, the player will be presented with this screen, where you can select a party to fight with.
