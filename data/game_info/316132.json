They start by placing their piece anywhere on the board.  After that, it can move a single space in any direction along the lines.<br/><br/>The hounds may only move forward or sideways.<br/><br/>The game is over when the hare makes it past the hounds, if the hounds succesfully trap the hare, or after 30 moves.<br/><br/>If the hounds play perfectly, they should always win.
