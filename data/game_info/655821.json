Can you beat all levels?</p>\n<p>This is a prototype developed for the August '21 One Game a Month game jam. I didn't have much time this month, so the end result is a bit crude (i.e. placeholder models, and very little polish). In the end I had to choose between creating a few more levels or making it prettier, and opted for the former. :)</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game starts with some tutorial levels, here are the keys for reference anyway:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left/Right arrows</strong> - aim. Use Shift for fine-aiming</li><li><strong>Space</strong> (hold then release) - shoot</li><li><strong>C</strong> - camera mode. While in camera mode you can't control the ball, instead:<ul><li><strong>Left/Right/Up/Down arrows</strong> - move the camera</li><li><strong>A/Z</strong> - zoom in and out</li><li><strong>C</strong> - exit camera mode</li></ul></li></ul><p>To quit during play, you'll have to exit directly (MAC: Cmd + Q, Win: Alt + F4), sorry about that (ran out of time in the end).<br/></p>\r\nDevelopment team\r\n<ul><li>Gonzalo Perez de la Ossa: game design, programming, level design</li><li>Sarah\u00a0Strachan: music</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I've used a few free assets, thanks heaps to all the authors for their generosity:</p>\n<p>SFX</p>\n<ul><li>Bouncer - https://freesound.org/people/Jofae/sounds/383240/</li><li>Accelerator - https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/523088/</li><li>Checkpoint - https://freesound.org/people/natemarler/sounds/338693/</li><li>Machine - https://freesound.org/people/steaq/sounds/509249/</li><li>Machine - https://freesound.org/people/szegvari/sounds/520564/</li><li>Exit - https://freesound.org/people/Kostas17/sounds/542825/</li></ul>\n<p>OTHERS</p>\n<ul><li>Skybox:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-volume-2-...</li><li>Ball material: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/metals/yughues-free-...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e216161cf9fa64624e9d3a8c42999f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dense13"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
