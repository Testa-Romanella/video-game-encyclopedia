{"id": 937493, "slug": "plunderstruck", "name": "Plunderstruck", "name_original": "Plunderstruck", "description": "<p>Plunderstruck is a single-player stealth-platformer game set in the fictional 1920's metropolis of Glitz City. You play as three characters with differing abilities: Clyde, who has smoke bombs to pass undetected, Ruby, who uses a grappling gun to reach new heights,\u00a0 and Manny, who uses a billy club to knock out enemies. You switch between 3 characters to collect loot, pull off heists, and rob locations of their valuable artifacts!<br/></p>\n<p>Plunderstruck is the game you'd get if you took 1990's The Lost Vikings and spliced it in a 1980's-style teleporter pod with 2010's The Swindle and Mark of the Ninja, and then sent that back in time to the 1920's.</p>\n<p><strong>The Story:</strong><br/>3 professional grifters: Clyde, Ruby, and Manny are small-time thieves in the crooked town of Glitz City. When their favorite bar becomes indebted to notorious crime boss Tommy Z, it's up to the crew to pay off his debts by stealing priceless artifacts from increasingly-dangerous locations across the city or watch their favorite watering hole get shut down.</p>\n<p><strong>The World:\u00a0</strong><br/>Greetings, guys and dolls, and welcome to Glitz City. It\u2019s 1924 and this place is the bee\u2019s knees, because no other city embodies the carefree spirit of the Roaring Twenties more than this one. It\u2019s a rollicking place where the\u00a0flappers stay a flappin\u2019 and the speaks are always easy.</p>\n<p>In this prosperous town, the upper crust is overflowing with simoleons, so it\u2019s an<br/>easy target for skimmers and scammers, the hard-boiled and the hooch hoods. For those who are engaged in dubiously legal occupations, fortune favors the bold. But a good thief can only be so greedy, because luck, just like fortune, tends to run out. So welcome to Glitz City. Everything is just hotsy-totsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>* Control 3 thieves with unique abilities who are so slick you'll wish you'd dropped out of school and taken up the rewarding and consequence-free life of burglary<br/><br/>* Rob a variety of zany locations like a gangster's hideout, high-rise hotel, steam train, and even an underwater sealab\u00a0that will painfully stretch the limits of your imagination, but in a good way</p>\n<p>* Purchase new gadgets to help further circumvent the law like a Jetpack for extra jumping, Smelling Salts to revive yourself in a pinch, and a Sleeping Gas Bomb to knock out those troublesome do-gooders trying to protect their valuables<br/><br/>* Collect optional outfits to drape your grifters in the hippest glad rags like the Cat Burglar, Golden Age Hero, Swanky Night Out, and many more that'll make you want to throw your clothes into a pile, set them on fire, and weep with shame<br/><br/>*\u00a0Boogey down and learn dance moves that have no gameplay value, but will leave you feeling good about yourself which, face it, we could all use nowadays<br/><br/>* Tap your foot along with a snazzy jazz soundtrack that will literally transport you back in time to the 1920's where you will surely cause a time paradox or two<br/><br/>*\u00a0Chat up some hep NPC's who will help you on your heists like the seasoned and elegant master thief Madame Voleur, shady back-alley dweller Trenchcoat Sal, and the beer-swilling bartender Jasper who will try their damnedest to substitute for real human interaction</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demo Scope:</strong><br/>The demo includes 5 levels which equate to roughly the first half of the game:\u00a0Gangster Hideout, Luxura Lodgings, Tillberry Manor, Sunnytime Trust Bank, and the Bullet Train. Also included are 3 side missions that open up as you progress.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remember this is a demo, so you will very likely run into bugs. Also some levels and cut-scenes do not have all of their art assets or music tracks yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Important Notes:<br/></p>\n<p>1. This demo includes an auto-save feature so you can pick up where you left off if you close and restart. However, there is no in-game notification currently that tells you when the game has saved (it's after completing a mission or exiting the gadget shop)<br/>2. As\u00a0 a generous playtester, your time is valuable. Therefore, a Skip button\u00a0has been included in each mission. Press \"Y\" to end a heist and return to the Hub.<br/>3. Controllers are supported. If it's not working, try unplugging and plugging back in. This appears to be a common Unity issue</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T17:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/1487e1d28a36853f2d6f83d85067a1a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sealab Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
