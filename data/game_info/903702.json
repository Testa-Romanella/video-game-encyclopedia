You may not get out of there alive, but your noble sacrifice will save many lives.\r\n</p>\n<p>How to play :\r\n</p>\n<p>Press X button to use laser. In humanoid form, the laser automically attacks all accessible targets, and in jet form it simply goes straight.\r\nHolding laser in humonoid form allows you to moonwalk.\r\n</p>\n<p>Press O button activates shield, in the exchange of 10 energy. Shield is the most important key to survival in NEDIAM. Use it wisely.\r\n</p>\n<p>Press down in humanoid form or the opposite direction in jet form to transform. In Jet form, you can fly around and get into narrow tunnels.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some NEDIAM defence systems give you energy when destroyed. Don't miss them !\r\n</p>\n<p>Don't waste your time. If you spend too much time in the level, you will be embushed by deadly misssile squads.\r\n</p>\n<p>P.S. Please forgive my crappy music and no moonlight sonata. I'm not a good composer.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51df6674f9b4b5a77e26b687c4bfacd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hijong Park"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
