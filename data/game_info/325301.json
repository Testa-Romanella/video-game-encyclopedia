The maker embodies his love of draping and intricate details. Re-create the famous works of Ert\u00e9, or put your own spin on these Art Deco period inspired looks. This concept was entirely inkscribble's idea. Until she suggested the theme, I had never before heard of Ert\u00e9. But when I started researching his work I recognized a lot of pieces, I just didn't know they were all by one man. Needless to say I fell in love and this has been one of the most inspiring games to work on! Working on art deco dresses and accessories, as re-imagined by inkscribble was an absolute joy. And now the dress up brings art deco fashions to your mobile phone :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T10:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaeef80036673caff2c7def0042f91ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Doll Divine Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Doll Divine Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
