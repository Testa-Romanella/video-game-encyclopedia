Theme: Fall.</p>\n<p>This game is about the fall of the SCP Foundation. Can you stave it off? Right now, for simplicity's sake, you have unlimited capability to place missile launchers, which are used to defend from SCP-3032, the only SCP currently implemented.</p>\n<p>(For the moment:\u00a0<strong>You can press t, c, and m to spawn random instances of SCP-3032 in a few of its phases</strong>. That is all. I am adding click-to-place missile systems for version 0.2.0 and from there, who knows?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a71d8e1780ee0682c1f57f872997e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Guard13007"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
