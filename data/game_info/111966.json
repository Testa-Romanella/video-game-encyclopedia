You must play as Mountain Dew to reck Doritos and become the supreme MLG snack food. Beware, the ball speeds up to super Sanic speeds, so you have to be a true pro to keep up. After five minutes, the MLG gods will get a 25 kill streak and end the game with a nuke. Whoever has the highest score when the nuke goes off, wins the game and becomes a true MLG!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d491e61cbb0d30a613a0d71bce099b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Tiny Country Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
