With the beautiful user interface especially designed for class-use, the engine is suited for people with little to no knowledge about computers to computer experts.Why do I need this?<br/>The engine has already been used in schools and tested by students (age: 13-17). The students found it extremely useful and easy to use. It helped them to get a better understanding of what all these complex chemical symbols really mean and what they look like in a fully 3D world, instead of a boring 2D paper.Our story<br/>As a child we always loved chemistry because we knew what it had to offer and why it was so important in our world. We noticed students just couldn't get a picture of what atoms really mean in our world. Some said chemistry is boring because they just didn't know what the point of all these complex formulas were. Others said it was all just too complicated to even bother learning. We believe chemistry is one of the most important aspects of our lives. So here we are, bringing education to the next level.  Quantum Engine is made in collaboration with a couple of chemistry teachers and professors in Belgium and we got a lot of tips from the chemistry community on the internet.Having a problem or a question?<br/>You can reach us 16/7 in a live chat  or call and we will make sure everything is quickly regulated.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e809c5b156fbc01ad23ebcbc6933dbef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wannes Vanoyenbrugge", "Jorn Segers"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["Quantum Engine"], "esrb_rating": null}
