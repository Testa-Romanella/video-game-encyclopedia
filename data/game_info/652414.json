I'm just a 14 - years old boy who is interested in making games. There will be plenty of bugs and I would be happy if you were to report them. I will also try my best to debug my game and if I get about $5 from donation, I would be more than happy, since $1 would be enough for me to be encouraged to add more features. There will be a lot of updates if I'm free enough, but if not, I don't think Stranded will have more features anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Hope to see you guys soon,</p>\n<p>Lonely Devil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a0a774d46239a6ca4b318cd1767c0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LonelyDevil"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
