Recently you've discovered that your \"father\" along with his business associate appear to have a little bit more then a messed up plan for your future. But it seems something strange is happening. You don't know what it is but it seems, familiar...</p>\n<p>Looks can be deceiving: This game is filled with many, many secrets. From text magically appearing on objects, to hidden books that unlock more gameplay. There is so much more that meets the eye. Could you figure it out?</p>\n<p>The true story: This game has a very complex story, both given and hidden. The question is could you find out what is actually happening? Can you figure out fact from fiction in this twisted story?</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game is a recreation, and remasters version of my old game that was sadly taken down called \"Obsolete horror game\". It also important to know everything in this game is based of stories made myself, not off of real life events. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Rated T: For teen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fdde148d90b283e4bc8d90a637c1860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Shirsefat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
