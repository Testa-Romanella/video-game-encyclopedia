{"id": 894085, "slug": "bug-stun", "name": "Bug Stun", "name_original": "Bug Stun", "description": "<p><strong>Released Date: 9th December 2022\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Bug Stun is a top-down shooter with a minimal yet entertaining level design. With graphics and sound effects like Atari 2600, it offers <strong>10 levels\u00a0</strong>to kill enemies on a map with obstacles, mechanics and secrets to discover.</p>\n\n\n<p>On a planet called <strong><em>Raf-Nak</em></strong> an invasion of insect-aliens is emerging. These space bugs are just like the ones on Earth\u00a0but they seem very changed, they are bigger and more deadly.\u00a0\u00a0They follow the orders of <strong><em>the Colonel</em></strong>, and their mission is to collect <strong><em>Raf-Nak</em>'s\u00a0</strong>natural resources<em>\u00a0</em>and\u00a0assemble military bases to attack Earth.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Agent Frago</em></strong> is the main member of a great elite of intergalactic soldiers\u00a0and offered to go there by himself and disable the \"parasite bases\".\u00a0\u00a0He will have to cross mesas, woods, deserts and tundras to\u00a0reach the main base and abort their plans of conquest once and for all.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>\"Let me make you a little sketch...\u00a0 Alright...\u00a0 Here\"</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Flamethrower:</strong>\u00a0It's a powerful weapon capable of burns trees and kill enemies very quickly to ashes. Its cooldown is slower than your ray pistol and it has very little ammo, so use it wisely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Medikit:</strong>\u00a0It restores 25 health points and heals you from poisoning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Ammo:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0Gives you 5 ammo for the flamethrower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Gold Medal:</strong>\u00a0They can be recognized by their brightness and are scattered around Raf-Nak in totally hidden places. If you find all 10 medals you can unlock a secret ending screen.\u00a0 \u00a0<em><strong>1500 points</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Keys and laser barriers:</strong>\u00a0 The keys can open the laser barriers that block your way depending on the color of the key itself. There are three colors: yellow, blue and pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Tree:</strong>\u00a0Looks like Earth pines and are possibly the only signs of life on Raf-Nak. Burn them to open ways or get items. But sometimes nothing comes of it, or even worse, Titanbees can appear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Bunker:</strong>\u00a0Go inside to make the pursuing Titanbees disappear instantly, but once you get out, it self-destructs and you won't use it again. Just like trees, you can find items but less frequently.</p>\n<p> <strong>Control Panel:</strong>\u00a0You always find them in the \"parasite bases\". Touch them to turn it off and complete the level.</p>\n\n\n<p> <strong>Moskiller:</strong> They are easy enough to deal with, but in group they can get annoying. Once it sees you, it will chase you to death. \u00a0\u00a0<strong><em>100 points</em></strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Scorqueror:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0They remains still, but watching your movements to throw poison at you from its stinger to progressively deplete your life. Although its poison is not very deadly, you can be in danger if you are low health.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong><em>300 points</em></strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Titanbee:</strong>\u00a0They has the same attack pattern as Moskiller, but with an addition: You can't kill it. To get rid of them, you must enter in a bunker. They appear randomly when you burn trees and they are really fast.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<em><strong>0 points</strong></em></p>\n<p> <strong>Scolossus:</strong>\u00a0When they notice your footsteps, they appear from the underground to surprise you, and bite you. Go a little slowly for not clash with them, although you can't tell where they are at first, is a mystery. But they really like narrow places and entrances.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong><em>250 points</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>- Upon death, you return to the title screen, but if you hold down the <strong><em>\"Up\"</em></strong> button and then press <strong><em>\"Space\"</em></strong>, you spawn on the level where you were killed.\u00a0More fun, less frustranting.</p>\n<p>- If you enter into an empty room, be careful. May some Scolossus can appear out and attack you by surprise.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0From time to time, touch the walls, you can find paths or hidden items that will help you.<br/></p>\n<p>- We already know that it's fun to burn trees with the flamethrower but don't waste ammo foolishly, because you could get stuck very easily and you would look like an idiot (no offense).</p>\n<p>- Think carefully about using the supplies that are lying around the level or burn trees. If you're not in a pinch on both health and ammo, don't touch them until you need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc72c77d07fa5e3911d239e41149cad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AsiGarSan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
