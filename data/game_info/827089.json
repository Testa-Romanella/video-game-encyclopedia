You meet creatures there called the Nomed who seem to live there. Find your way out using their help!</p>\n<p>This was a game I worked on for my dissertation, which I'm quite proud of. Even got awarded for it too!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to create a game focusing on mental health, but in a generalized way, because everyone experiences times, where they feel hopeless due to something occurring in their life. This game acts as a metaphor for going through life's ups and downs.</p>\n<p>Even though this is a complete game, there may be some bugs that I still can't seem to polish (will list below with solutions). However, I am totally open to discussion and feedback. Thank you for playing and enjoy! :)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Current known issues:</p>\n<p>Player disappears if caught by skeleton hand obstacle- Continually press in one direction key only and move away from the obstacle the moment you notice you have been released (occurs in level 1 and 6)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits (hyperlinked):</strong></p>\n<p>Character and background sprites by me</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts -</strong></p>\n<p>Shadows Into Light by Kimberly Geswein</p>\n<p>My Unprofessional Handwriting by Anika Tovernic</p>\n<p>Levorotary by \uc0bc\uc871\uc791 samjokjak<br/></p>\n<p>obtained from Dafont.com</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds by these amazing people/sites-</strong></p>\n<p>Jumping Man Sounds - IgnasD</p>\n<p>Colossal Boss Battle Theme - Matthew Pablo</p>\n<p>Cries From Hell- jalastram/Jes\u00fas Lastra</p>\n<p>Synthwave 4K - The Cynic Project/cynicmusic</p>\n<p>Amnesia - Micheal Carey</p>\n<p>Cave theme - Brandon75689</p>\n<p>Dark Ambiance - Philippe Groarke</p>\n<p>The Deeper Caverns - Tsorthan Grove<br/></p>\n<p>4 Atmospheric ghostly loops - Independent.nu (submitted by qubodup)<br/></p>\n<p>Bat sound - polymorpheva</p>\n<p>7 Eating Crunches - Star Ninjas &amp; Tito</p>\n<p>Falling Body - remaxim<br/></p>\n<p>Wind1- Luke.RUSTLTD</p>\n<p>Walking sound - Mohammad Shamaas (apparently not available anymore)</p>\n<p>Bones rattle - congusbongus</p>\n<p>Witch cackle, Ringing in ears, Earthquake , Shades of Orange , Ghastly Whispers (cannot find original anymore)\u00a0from Zapsplat.com<br/></p>\n<p>Swishes- artisticdude</p>\n<p>Tribal Drums - Matthew Newman (submitted by bart)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T08:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21c/21cb44fb783f720dc7724b762ce9c6a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fallgazer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
