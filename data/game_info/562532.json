I'm also working on a mobile game or two to try and solve this issue but until then I'm limited in my abilities to do more content</p>\n<p>the quit button doesnt work properly but eh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b57052c91a1409e803028c67f7f353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["deathy108"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
