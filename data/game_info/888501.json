Use our omnidirectional combat system to defeat enemies that rise from the lava. \u00a0These enemies are interconnected to the lava, so killing them slows down the lava.\u00a0And watch out for fireballs!</p>\n<p>Controls- used WASD to move, space bar to jump, and mouse to attack and block(left and right click)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c942c65b8d3d61024c7c67cc7751329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mitnik3"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
