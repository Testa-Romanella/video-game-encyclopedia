Level up and unlock Modules to be as quick and as cool as possible in crushing all of your enemies and getting the highest score out there<br/> </li><li> <strong>Classic Mode</strong> - a throwback to the prequel I made when I was 14 years old, much simpler gameplay<br/> </li><li> <strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> - a more spiced up version of the Arcade; everything hits harder, besides you.. There is also a HackBarrier that prevents you from running too far away from your problems  : )<br/> </li><li> <strong>Meteor Madness</strong> - You're only left with your lightsaber, good luck surviving the endless Comet Storm<br/> </li></ul> </li><li> <strong>Adventure Mode</strong> - A rogue-like campaign mode, where you travel through Zones and get strong enough to conquer <strong>Bosses</strong> and free the Amethyst Galaxy from the imminent doom of The Singularity<br/> </li><li> <strong>Sandbox Mode / Spacebox</strong> - A (almost) working gamemode creator where you can edit a lot of values to make your own type of experience and share it with other players!<br/> </li><li> A unique progression system; The so called Celestial Energy is not only your XP, but also an asset used with some weapons or skills. After hitting a ceiling of this energy you manifest a Power Core used for Module &amp; Skill unlocks, and can <strong>Ascend</strong>, gaining a Celestial Star, that can be used for direct Ship stat upgrades<br/> </li><li> 26+ Ship skins and a hell lot of total combinations with other customization options<br/> </li><li> 3 <strong>Banger soundtracks</strong> from SiriusBeat and climactic OSTs by Lidkas for each Boss you encounter<br/> </li><li> <strong>Juicy gameplay</strong> with strong screenshake, particles, flashes, and a crispy pixel art mostly done by me, but credits for bosses go to Shy<br/> </li><li> 23+ Achievements to keep your ventures validated</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T21:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6f2021b212a5c257c167f32c9e3e57.jpg", "website": "https://hypergamesdev.github.io/sss222", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HyperGamesDev", "Hyper!"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HyperLemonStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
