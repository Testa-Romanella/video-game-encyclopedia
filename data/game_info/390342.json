It's just a very slow game!</p>\n\n<p>Arrows move the cursor.</p>\n<p>Z selects a tile.</p>\n<p>When a tile is selected, the arrows will toggle the directions your slime will try to spread from that tile. Pressing Z again will increase how much of your slime is sent from that tile. X unselects.</p>\n<p>The more slime you have on a tile, the faster it will reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>Happy sliming!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/64768a1f4f0ac75c70870aeeff910d2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RhizGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
