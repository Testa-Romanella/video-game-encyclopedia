The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen (&quot;Action Mask&quot;) from his prison before Action Kamen&#39;s supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen&#39;s and Shin-chan&#39;s worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan&#39;s friends and family.</p>\n<p>The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise&#39;s penchant for weird/gross-out humor. It is the second of three Shin-Chan games to reach the Super Famicom (sandwiched between 1993&#39;s Crayon Shin-Chan: Arashi wo Yobu Enji and 1996&#39;s Crayon Shin-Chan: Osagusu Dobon) and was never released outside of Japan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T02:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c3f5c57e0c1f0e0bddec1ead682557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Sun L"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": null}
