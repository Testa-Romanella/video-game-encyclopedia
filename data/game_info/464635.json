So many ambitions, dreams, and hopes snuffed out. The hard work of generations befell to the cataclysms of a Total War.</strong></p>\n<p>As far as you know you are the only one left. You and your trusty drones. They are essential to navigate the highly radioactive wastelands and harmful anomalies that prevail the ruins of the city.</p>\n<p>Use your drones to collect essential items and memories of the past and avoid the anomalies such as \"the jammer\", \"the black hole\" and \"the magnetic field\". Due to the radiation levels you have lost manual control of the drones and have to use the onboard navigation device to give it headings. Having hardwired it to spin around the drone, try to time the new headings so that you get around the ruin as fast as possible. Hurry or you will run out of control!</p><p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>Press <strong>B</strong> to toggle the controller on off.</p><p>While the controller is on, use the\u00a0<strong>Mouse\u00a0</strong>to move the drone in the direction of the spinning radar header.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b34226230711601ed9aeb5f976fca16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brightfield Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
