Become a part of AG world!</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chess figures &amp; \u00a0movements involved,\r\n</li><li>RPG features,\r\n</li><li>Fast expansion in PvP seamless map,\r\n</li><li>Long-term Tower Defence.\r\n</li><li>Strategic adrenaline action over several areas - all at once!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Commonly, Armygrid is played on a 2.5D mode. Worth to mention that\u00a0this game also\u00a0offers a 2D option for weaker devices and phones.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will start the game having only this figure. It moves just by a single square step by step. It might feel tiresome, to move quite slowly, but don't worry ! Shortly, \u00a0you will unlock the next chess figure -\u00a0<strong>Bishop</strong>!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Bishops</strong>\u00a0can move pretty far, you just need to upgrade them. Also, in this game Bishop has classic movements combined with\u00a0<strong>Pawn</strong>\u00a0ones, so you are able to\u00a0switch the lane when needed.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>And the list doesn't end here -</strong>\u00a0keep in mind that\u00a0by progressing you will discover all of the chess figures.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Right after the quick tutorial completion, you will be dragged into a huge zone -<strong>\u00a0Maze</strong>. It's a\u00a0<strong>PvE zone</strong>, safe from PvP &amp; \u00a0floats just like\u00a0the main progression zone where you will \"grind\" a.k.a\u00a0keep attacking NPCs and level up your King.\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>P.S.\u00a0</strong>Your chess figures will be automatically upgraded while progressing - you won't have to do it manually.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>So.....</strong>\u00a0 You will need to wipe this whole area -\u00a0burn down every wall, tower, &amp; conquer every square field. This way you can increase\u00a0your\u00a0<strong>Gold Income</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Level up</strong>\u00a0&amp; find\u00a0<strong>R</strong><strong>are Items</strong>\u00a0to equip with. Also, you will get various\u00a0quests on the fly.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And after this stage is completed, you will be introduced to\u00a0another one -\u00a0<strong>a stronger one.</strong>\u00a0In the meanwhile,\u00a0the old Maze zone\u00a0is replaced with a new unique zone where you can continue farming.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>As you reach level 12, you will have an access to the PvP zone</strong>. It won't take long - promise!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>P.S. That's doable in ~30 minutes from the game start (10 mins for hardcore players).</em>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>What you see here - is a freshly launched server and the first 9 players who reached level 12 &amp;\u00a0accessed the PvP zone.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>It's a seamless zone where players can<strong>\u00a0attack neighbors</strong>,\u00a0<strong>loot gold</strong>,\u00a0<strong>conquer enemy castles</strong>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<strong>fight in real-time.</strong>\n</li><li>Deploy Chess pieces to attack enemies, build up Towers and Walls to protect your area, and conquer Fields and Totems for a higher stats bonus.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Here is actually the best fun action of this game!\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>ALLIANCES\u00a0</strong>- are so powerful! Players can research many different bonuses which apply to all ally members. Also, members can deploy troops in the PvP zone from allied castles and help fellow warriors\u00a0to defend against enemies even if they are offline! You can communicate with your allies through\u00a0chat.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>MORE AREAS</strong>.\u00a0I could continue here with the next areas - Cave and Crusade, but it's gonna be more exciting to discover them by yourself. Remember, each area has its own unique features. For example, in the\u00a0<strong>Maze area\u00a0</strong>- all figures can burn down everything, while in the\u00a0<strong>PvP zone</strong>\u00a0- only Pawns can burn down. And in\u00a0<strong>Cave</strong>\u00a0- nothing can be burned down.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Servers\u00a0restart every 9 weeks - basically, they get wiped off.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>All players who sustain the first 5 weeks\u00a0will participate in the final Apocalypse event, which lasts for 4 weeks.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The whole server, all\u00a0together, will work on surviving as long as possible, to get cross-server rewards - Skill Points.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The longer you survive - the better rewards.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The more players are demolished by NPC, the stronger attack will come the next day. Players are using their most powerful abilities to stop the enemy before it get's split towards all event participants.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This game is long term and you will be awarded with\u00a0<strong>Skill Points</strong>, which persist forever between servers. You will also be able to\u00a0<strong>sell</strong>\u00a0your collected Skill Points or\u00a0<strong>buy</strong>\u00a0from the others.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>ARMYGRID.COM<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T16:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78abfdb5fd84b349a31938b7b9255479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChessWarriors"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
