Only catch is that poor old Tom has experienced a partial vision loss, so he'll need to use all of his senses to figure it out.</p>\n<p>\"Blur\" is played mainly via sound and other low-resolution graphical cues, due to the main character's partial vision, which slowly increases in resolution as the game progresses and he regains his sight.</p>\n<p>WARNING: The game depends heavily on sound, so plug those headphones in! It's impossible to play without sound :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b4446a7666e8254413773c2260a2050b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mit-mit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
