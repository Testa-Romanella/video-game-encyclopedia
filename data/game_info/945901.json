The die faces are randomly mixed in the draw pool.  Ten of the die faces are drawn from the pool and are shown at top.</p>\n<p>Each turn, players roll their dice.  Dice may be held or rerolled up to twice more--click the \"Roll\" and \"Hold\" buttons to select the dice.  Hovering over a die with the mouse will display the content of the other faces on the status bar as well as additional information about the top face.</p>\n<p>If any dice are held with blank faces, these will be filled with die faces from the pool.  Select a dice face from the top of the screen, and a blank die to apply it.  The first player takes a single face, then each player takes two, alternating until all the dice are showing a face.</p>\n<p>Each player then selects how they want to score their dice.  A player may accept a zero score for combinations they cannot satisfy.  Some scoring combinations can be filled multiply ways--in this case multiple buttons will be shown to claim the score.  When both players have scored their dice, the pool is restocked and the next round starts.</p>\n<p>In all phases, the name plate in the top corners will be white when that player can take an action.</p>\r\nGame Options\r\nRule Sets\r\n<p><strong>HoloEN</strong> uses 6 copies of the 11 Hololive English members.  IRyS can be used as a wildcard in most generation-based combinations, except for the most valuable \"Debut\" combination.  Memberships can be claimed for any of the talents awarding more points the more copies you have.  However each talent's membership can only be claimed once.</p>\n<p><strong>HoloID</strong> uses 8 copies of the 9 Hololive Indonesia members.  Scoring is similar to the HoloEN rule sets, but the more numerous, but smaller, generations require more careful planning of your dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard</strong> uses 10 copies of the numbers 1 through 6.  uses standard the typical Yacht melds adding only the drafting mechanic.  </p>\r\nDice Set\r\n<p>Switches dice from pictures of the talents to their oshi marks which may be visually clearer.</p>\r\nGame Length\r\n<p>In a short game, each combination can only be claimed once.  In a long game each combination can be claimed twice.  Extra care must be taken with selecting die faces as you have fewer opportunities to build scoring combinations from the draft pool and will need well-crafted dice to create lucky rolls.</p>\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n<p>Characters belong COVER Corp. and associated talents; available under a permissive policy for derivative works.</p>\n<p>Game play is similar to the classic Yacht game, also known/published as Poker Dice, Yatzy, and other names.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T12:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/107ac55ea5672978b1cfeddba216cb77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mifinti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
