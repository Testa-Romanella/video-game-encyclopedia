{"id": 825183, "slug": "cyber-slug", "name": "Cyber Slug", "name_original": "Cyber Slug", "description": "<p><strong>Cyber slug</strong> is an infinite platform shooter inspired by the mechanic of Metal Slug, this is a Game Programming class final project done in two weeks by two people.</p>\n<p>*We originally thought of using Metal Slug art assets but the art is way too complex, hence the name, looking back this is probably a dumb decision to make SNK breathing down our necks in copyright infringement issues, thankfully we avoid that :\u2019)</p>\r\nFeatures!\r\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have a lot of them, but this is itch.io so we gotta <em>cough</em> sells <em>cough</em> ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCyberpunky-ish Aesthetic.\r\n<p>Feast in a cyberpunk-themed aesthetic\u2026 well <strong>ackchyually</strong> it\u2019s technically vaporwave but <strong>Cyber Slug</strong> is a superior name to <strong>Vapor Slug.</strong> The color palette used is epilepsy, I don\u2019t know how anyone can play this for at least 30 minutes without developing <strong>diplopia</strong> afterward. But hey it\u2019s pretty fun.\r\n </p>\r\nResponsive Control and Combat Mechanics.\r\n<p>Well, I lied, it works about 85%, 80% of the time. There are still some bugs that can get ironed out, but bear in mind we\u2019re using a self-made game framework equivalent to a 1990\u2019s Honda Accord with a broken suspension and tough TOUGH hand-cranked windows. But hey, it\u2019s one of your uncle\u2019s favorite cars, you have fond memories of it going on a long trip with the families.\r\n </p>\r\nIt\u2019s not a bug, it\u2019s a feature.\r\n<p>When you declare it like this, nobody can mention any bugs, because we call it features here. Here is a list of <strong>Cyber Slug\u2019s</strong> \u201cunintentional implemented feature\u201d:\r\n </p>\n<ul> <li>The player\u2019s head will be stuck to the platform after jumping and bopping its head\u00a0to it. This is due to the number of hair products used in the hair, I mean look at it, it\u2019s bright fiery pink, must get pretty dry, and needs a ton of moisturizer.\r\n </li><li>The enemy doesn\u2019t know how to walk properly, they just cripwalked all over the place.\r\n </li><li>Sometimes the computer gods just missed a single crucial timing that makes the player or enemy yeeted out of existence.\r\n </li><li>The player can get \u201cmutilated\u201d when jumping at the wrong angle toward the platform, making his body stuck in the middle of the platform. Unfortunately, it does not get covered by insurance.\r\n </li><li>And the list goes on and on\u2026\\</li></ul>\r\nBanger Music and SFX\r\n<p>This is probably the only redeeming factor. The music and SFX are really really crisp with that 8-bit gritty quality, shout out to:\r\n </p>\n<ul> <li>BGM:\u00a0[Music Assets] FREE Music Loop Bundle by Tallbeard Studios (itch.io)&lt;a href=\"https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle\" ]&lt;music=\"\" assets]=\"\" free=\"\" music=\"\" loop=\"\" bundle=\"\" by=\"\" tallbeard=\"\" studios=\"\" (itch.io)&lt;=\"\" a=\"\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</li><li>SFX:\u00a0300+ Futuristic SFX with names (strategy game sound effects) by GameSupplyGuy (itch.io)</li></ul>\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n<p>Special thanks to Mr. Eriq as our professor, who teaches us Game Programming for a whole month.\r\n </p>\n<p>Other than music and SFX, here is the list of other assets used in this project.
