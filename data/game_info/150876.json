This game was made for the GBJAM 5 https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5</p>\n<p>To play, simply move around using the controls below. The longer you let an enemy shroom grow, the more points you get for smashing it, but you'll be taking more of a risk. The game gets more difficult as you smash more enemy shrooms.
