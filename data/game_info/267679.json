Proud elves, hard-working dwarves and noble humans scattered across the province. An immense arcane tower lies in the heart of the island, looming over the people. Legends say its power is the only thing holding back the dark forces seeking passage into our realm. <br/><br/>King El-Roh, our ruler, lives in the capital bestead in the south. The one and only road leading back from town diverges into three paths, each taking you into different part of the kingdom. But that's not what matters most. At the Crossroads, there is a tavern. Not just a plain lodge, like many others. It's the \"Erba 'Modi\" tavern - this land's best-known inn! Mainly because you can't miss the thing whilst going to the capital, but the booze is terrific too! You can take my word for it! The tavern sees a whole lotta plain folks and quite a great deal of nobles stopping on their way to or from the capital. <br/><br/>And in the very heart of this clatter is our Lia - a charming half-elvish girl, who's just sick of all this.<h3>Features: </h3><ul><li> guide our prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in multiple fashions,<br/></li><li> multiple storylines with unlockable, alternative paths,<br/></li><li> variable gameplay (each act has its own motive),<br/></li><li> over 10 reachable endings,<br/></li><li> a unique mix of fantasy, mystery, conspiracy, suspense, romance, <br/></li><li> Steam achievements and trading cards.</li></ul><h3>It's Your Story, which path will you take?</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T03:49:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/26471744fa9823db571e8ed36e093641.jpg", "website": "http://yourstory.legalgeekery.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Joshua Auriemma", "GameLoad"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joshua Auriemma", "GameLoad"], "esrb_rating": null}
