The player is met with a somber ambience as they navigate the rocky terrain across the stage's multiple levels of elevation. An element of urgency is given through the mass of tentacles below the player and arches that will launch them across stage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/823906d398d5eed2e12af167745bdc85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Therulerofearth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
