You are an American bi-plane fighting through waves of German planes and zeppelins. In the future, I would like to add more waves and eventually make it endless. I will also put a score counter in so you can see your score and try to beat your previous one.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrows-Move</p><p>F-Fire</p><p>ESC-exit fullscreen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/3429ca5d2e02f9d79f816815c899198f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Warrior19 Gaming"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
