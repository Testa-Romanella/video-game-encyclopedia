For any 1.2 version you might need to install Python 3.5, and tkinter will come with it. Specific instructions is in the download and install instructions, so you might want to check that out if you are having any problems or you don't know how to do it. Tic - Tac - Toe, version 2.0, will try to change the installation so you don't need to install Python, but this is going to take some work and won't come out for quite some time. \u00a0Also, the 2.0 version will introduce some AI in the game, but only really for a test. Right now, you have to play with someone else, sorry for all of you loners. Once you do launch the game, it's pretty clear what happens next.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d26a39d0df8593a2c5681541fac9d0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexrules237"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
