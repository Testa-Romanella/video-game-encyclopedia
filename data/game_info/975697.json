One day, everything fell apart, and the world turned into a massive pyramid. Various of creatures found homes on different \"layers\", each based on how high or low they were. With no physical paths connecting these layers, we could only travel using huge \"portals\".<br/><br/>The surviving humans live in the lowest, poorest areas of this new world. They call it the \"Tower of Shards\" and hope to reach the top of the world one day, breaking free from an unfair destiny.<br/><br/>While we won't give in to this strange fate, only a few people, known as \"the Marked\", can safely travel through the \"portals\". They're our last hope.<h3>Endless Expeditions: </h3>Since humans are living in areas with few resources, it's up to \"the Marked\" to start expeditions to bring back resources home. Unlock different characters, buildings, and items to equip your heroes and use their skills at the right time, making each journey unique. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Base Building &amp; Gear Merge: </h3>With the resources you've collected, you can build and expand human homes in many fun ways. As supplies grow and new buildings pop up, humans can start to help \"the Marked\" with all kinds of battle structures like buildings, gear, and other supplies. Expand your stronghold and merge equipment for stronger setups.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Strategic Deck Building: </h3>With every new building in the stronghold, you'll unlock a bunch of fun, mysterious cards. The cards you use will change how you can support in battles. Always be ready to change up your cards based on what's happening in the expedition.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Real Time Hero Combat: </h3>As things change on the battlefield, more and more \"Marked\" start to stand out. From brave warriors and strong knights to magical wizards and nature-loving druids, each has their special traits and skills. Use your leadership to recruit and lead them in the engaging real time combat.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>Besides the Tower of Shards, there are also other races who want to reach the top. Be ready for anything happening, learn from your expeditions, go through more portals, climb higher, break free from humans fate, and fulfill this eternal quest.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T08:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f84cd153d8e3bc87a7892903a5fefec.jpg", "website": "https://www.drakkargames.com/eternalquest", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 398, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drakkar Game Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Surefire.Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
