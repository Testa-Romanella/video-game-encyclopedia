Detailed trigger warnings are included in the visual novel itself and are mandatory reading before each act.\u00a0Please take care and be safe while playing.</strong></p>\n<p>Katheryn is getting through high school by keeping her head down and waiting for graduation to arrive, and she's\u00a0<em>fine\u00a0</em>with that, thank you very much. She's not a Katheryn who is arrogant and rightfully so - she's not even a Katheryn who is on par with her classmates. But she's a Katheryn who isn't drawing attention to herself in a way that will have people going for her head, and that's\u00a0<em><strong>fine</strong> ...\u00a0</em>even if it means she doesn't have any friends apart from her cousin.<br/></p>\n<p>A group project threatens to change that, as she's forcibly paired with the most insufferable guy in her music class:\u00a0lazy, self-important, and flirtatious Harry Iverson.\u00a0To her horror, she discovers that the more she gets to know him, the more she likes his company. Sure, he's arrogant, possessive, and hard to get along with ... but maybe she likes those things about him?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reality check.</em>\u00a0</strong>Finding someone's toxic personality traits endearing doesn't make them any less toxic, and as their relationship develops, Katheryn finds herself feeling more and more uncomfortable around Harry. By the time she realises what she's gotten herself into, she feels it's too late to get out. Nobody knows that Katheryn has a dark history that she's unwillingly repeating in her current relationship, but will that history define her future?</p>\n<p>(Title screen art by Kit.
