The Avarre tribe and the Shraika tribe have both laid claim to the same area of land- and they both say that it is part of their ancestral homeland. Unfortunately, the Karaian government refuses to interfere at all, not wanting to take sides lest they be attacked by the other. A few little fights between the two tribes quickly escalate into a full-blown war, where no prisoners are taken and no mercy is given on either side.\r\n</p>\n<p>Among the many dragons caught up in the war is Garan, a young engineer, and his family. Forced into the war against their will, he and his family soon rocketed up in the army\u2019s ranks due to their skills in combat. Garan became a captain of a small company. His sons, Sarife and Pippa, became lieutenants of platoons, as well as his adopted daughter, Misha. His mate, Lasha, became a field medic due to her medical training. Even though they didn\u2019t want to be in the war, everything was going well. They had good positions, and the war was going in their favor. It was predicted to be won in a month or so, and then they could go home.\r\n</p>\n<p>At least, that was until the tides changed. When the Avarre had reached the edge of Shraika territory, they met a fierce counterattack the likes of which they had never seen before. Garan was badly injured in the battle while protecting Lasha while she was tending to a wounded soldier. Garan\u2019s face was badly mauled, and he lost his sight to infection three days later. Over the next several days, the Shraika tribe had taken back almost all of the territory they had taken. Blinded and struggling to get around on his own, Garan was forced to retrain and continue to fight, despite the incredible danger to him. The fighting soon became a stalemate, but the battles only intensified, and within a few months of Garan\u2019s wounds, one of his sons was badly injured as well. With their whole family struggling to even live, and everyone around them dying, is it possible for them to survive? But, as it turns out, the war might just be the least of their worries, as a dark threat looms on the horizon....\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:33:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DragonCloudBurst"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
