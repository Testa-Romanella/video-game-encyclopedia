We will need your help to evolve the human being, a new\u00a0 useful specimen we will need in further investigations.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With our advanced technologies you will be able to connect this specimen braincells to each other in order to mix primary colors and obtain the secondary ones. This will create neural conexions. Just grab the border of a braincell and pull the mouse to connect them to operators.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As you can mix colors with the \"+\" operator, mixing secondary colors will give you white color.\u00a0You can divide them with the % operator to get primary colors from secondary ones aswell.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The \"=\" operator is a special one, it will give you the same color but you will be able to take it further away.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Also dividing primary colors will give you black because black is the absence of color itself.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mixing colors with black or white will give the same color back, use it to plan your strategy.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The final objective is to match the braincells to create neural networks as roots to get the concept that humanity will need to evolve. Good Luck in your way scientist!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Antonio Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00edn - Level Designer &amp; 3D Artist / Twitter: @ajotagamedev</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jardhel D.
