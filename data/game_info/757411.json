As of now, there will be depictions of Major Character Death (yours included), Gore, Extreme Violence,\u00a0 Swearing,\u00a0 Body Mutilation, Sexual Content (maybe). The list will be updated as the story is updated.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>All you wanted was a break. Just a day when your life wasn\u2019t filled with worrying about when your next essay was due or if you had a night shift with your sleazy co-worker who just won\u2019t take no for an answer. Hell, you were so desperate for some downtime that you would be happy with just an <strong>HOUR</strong> of peace.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>One day, your friend Tama recommends an experimental VR game called \u201cLittle Trails of Horror\u201d to destress. As someone who survived their very own horror movie, you figure that there isn\u2019t anything that you haven\u2019t seen that would shake you to your core. It also helps that there is an incentive of 10,000 dollars for participating. You decide to sign up, imaging that there were worst things that you could be doing on a Friday night. What you anticipated was cheesy graphics, with too much gore and too many jump scares. Not a darkness that seems too natural and a breath on the back of your neck that feels too warm.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Now stuck within these games with no way to leave without completing the objectives, your only worry now is to survive and find a way to break this vicious cycle. But every time you get even close to doing that or finding someone with answers, they die on you. Will you be able to escape for good or continue to be dragged from mission to mission, or worse?\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Select your gender, sexuality, and appearance!\r\n</li><li>Choose from 3 backgrounds that will help determine your stats.\r\n<ul><li>Stats matter people\u00a0\r\n</li></ul></li><li>\u00a0Develop a bond that is not easily broken with any one of 4-gender selectable RO\u2019s\r\n<ul><li>1 mystery RO is included but if you love yourself, don\u2019t romance the mystery RO\r\n</li></ul><ul><li>Help your RO find their purpose, or stray them off course into chaos\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Piss an eldritch horror off, and live to tell the story, maybe?\r\n</li><li>Shop til you drop, literally.\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Players can buy products at Florences Precarious Wonders.

They know what they like and don\u2019t like and have no problem letting you know it. However, you\u2019ve realized that anyone chosen to play the games is far from simple. Passionate, warm, and supporting, you\u2019ve found Alex to be loyal to a fault, once you\u2019ve earned their respect (or affection), and know that they would willingly follow you into hell, but is that necessarily a good thing? [<em>Has a predetermined \u2018relationship\u2019 with Moore</em>]\r\n</li><li><strong>\u00a0Meridith (F) / Micah (M) Moore</strong>: Moore is an arrogant and confident, overly confident if you ask their friends, individual. They are an up-and-coming lawyer working in Napa Valley, California, at one of the most prestigious law firms in the country. With their put-together suits and their overpriced cologne, you can almost smell the privilege rolling off of them. For this reason, you cannot fathom how they got involved with the game. Is there something hiding behind their well-placed fa\u00e7ade, or are they really as arrogant as they seem? <em>[Has a predetermined \u2018relationship\u2019 with Adakai</em>]\r\n</li><li><strong>Nasir (M) / Zahra (F) Faizan</strong>: An aloof and cranky player that seems hellbent on pretending that you don\u2019t exist. They haven\u2019t participated in the game for too long, but they already seem to have a reputation. Considered an omen and not the good kind, it\u2019s known that anyone who partners with them dies shortly after. Is their attitude towards you justified? Or do they just need a bowl of raisins to clear up that ever constipated expression?\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>\u00a0Felix (M) / Jalissa (F) Alvarez</strong>: A computer programmer from New Mexico, the way you two met wasn\u2019t exactly the best. To be exact, you almost get them killed, but they seem to still want to be your friend despite the blunder. Self-nominated as the cinnamon roll of the group, you can\u2019t help but want to go to them for all of your emotional issues. You\u2019ve found their optimism and gentile attitude to be precisely what you need in this game. However, behind their too wide grins and hearty laughs, you can\u2019t help but feel that something is wrong. Oh, so wrong.\r\n</li><li><strong>Mystery RO (M)</strong>:\u00a0 An entity that\u2019s guile has only grown stronger with his age. He needs you, but for what, you\u2019re not sure. Catching the attention of two eldritch horrors cannot be good, but you notice that he seems to regard you with a special kind of affection. However, you cannot help but wonder that his love for you will fade once his need for you is over. He is a wanderer, but once he finds himself committing to you. He will never let you go. Not even death will keep you two apart, unfortunately.\u00a0 [<em>Has a predetermined relationship with the Magadalane</em>]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/348/348427582e3a54effe5c537d8882d226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["summora"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
