Or in the English version is Brave X Valor. This game is adapted from my Animation Series project who also created by me, but this game version is the second Alpha Demo, maybe it's still not 100% full game, because I want to survey first. If it is already 100% full game, of course I will not post and release it here. In this post, you can try and get the\u00a0 game for free. If maybe you want to support the developer, you can donate\u00a0below :)\r\nokay, that's enough for the explanation, let's have\u00a0look the game in detail below:\r\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\r\nGAME DETAILS\r\n<p>--Game Title--<br/><strong>Original Version</strong> : Pelajar Tangguh - The Multiverse Crossover<br/><strong>English Version</strong> : Brave X Valor<br/><strong>Developer</strong> : Anigames Project<br/><strong>Genre</strong> : Action, Adventure, Fantasy, RPG<br/><strong>Version</strong> : Alpha Demo v2<br/><strong>Rate</strong> : 16+<br/><strong>Release Date</strong> : 01 August 2022</p>\n<p>The second Alpha version of Brave X Valor\u00a0\u00a0is focused on the Indonesian region first, because this is still an Alpha version. So maybe the language will be default using Indonesian than English (I will work for the multiple language if the game progress has been completed). Plus this game is still not 100% completed and still unfinish, especially for the Characters and Main Maps of the game, but some other maps are complete and ready to be played thoroughly, plus you can also play this game until the ending of this second Alpha version. So it's not just an ordinary roaming, but you can also do the\u00a0 Missions/Quests in the game, and complete some Achievements, and others.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\r\nGAME MODES\r\n<p>This Game has 3 different modes, and each game mode have a separate and different gameplay, but they connected to each other, such as the Locked/Unlocked feature, as well as several new places on the game map, etc. You can play them all at once!! *_*</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>STORY MODE</strong>\u00a0 <br/>This is the main playable mode of the <strong><em>Brave</em></strong> storyline. This mode is separate from other modes, but for this Alpha v2 edition you still can't play this <strong>Story Mode</strong>. Story Mode will be available when the game has been officially completed 100% and published to the upcoming web game platform.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>FREEROAM MODE</strong><br/> This mode is a free mode that you can play in this Alpha v2 edition, with the Open World category, in this mode you can travel and adventure in Multiverse across 2 different worlds. You can run Missions and Quests in this Freeroam Mode, and the storyline in Freeroam mode is different from Story Mode, so this mode has its own Brave X Valor storyline and is specifically played in Single Player and Multiplayer, but Multiplayer is still not ready in this Alpha version <strong><em>(coming soon)</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>ARCADE MODE</strong> <br/>This Arcade Mode is a combat mode of all characters and locations in the game combined, you can play it in turns.

With the Locked/Unlocked feature for each character, mode, and location, it allows you to collect everything and choose your hero character in this mode.</li></ul>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\r\nGAME FEATURE\r\n<p>The in-game features have been updated and there are quite a few, maybe only a few have been included for this Alpha v2 edition, for more complete features will be present in the full game later.</p>\n<p>Game features only occur in the Freeroam Mode, for the Story Mode and Arcade Mode are only standard.</p>\n<p>What is the features\u00a0 in\u00a0\u00a0<strong><em>Brave X Valor</em></strong>\u00a0 game?</p>\n<p>- Missions/Quests<br/>- Interaction (Social &amp; Objects)<br/>- Entering House/Portal<br/>- Vehicle Riding<br/>- Horse Riding<br/>- Usable Weapons<br/>- Recruit Gang / Party<br/>- Player Skills<br/>- Player Swimming<br/>- Inventory (use <strong>\"X\"</strong> button to\u00a0open/close)<br/>- Journal<br/>- Achievements<br/>- Racing<br/>- Shop<br/>- NPCs</p>\n<p>All the features in the upcoming full game will be even more interesting than above, but for this Alpha v2 edition, the developer only includes a list of features above, so you can do a lot in the game. :)</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENT\r\n<p>This system requirement is not final, because it may not be correct, for example if it says high specifications, but when you try it on your PC/Laptop, it can even be played.

The developer's intention was to remaking the school building which was making it pretty lag, but there was no time, because the developer wanted to continue the animation project.<br/>So maybe that's the only problem for FPS, the rest is safe and smooth.</p>\n<p>This is a screenshot when the developer built the school building for the first time and used the wrong technique, so that it could burden the initial gameplay.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n\r\nGET THE GAME NOW!!\r\n<p>Alright, I think that's enough to give details of this game, for those of you who want to download it, please click on the button below.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Respect the developer's hard work by not reposting this post on your website, if that happens then the developer will not continue this game again in the future.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note 2:</em></strong>\u00a0 If you wish to request game features or maybe you want to give Feedback, Criticism, Suggestions.
