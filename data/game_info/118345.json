{"id": 118345, "slug": "rose-seed-minigame", "name": "Rose Seed Minigame", "name_original": "Rose Seed Minigame", "description": "<p>Rose Seed Minigame is a game about two silly galactic castaways playing a platform jumping game together on their date. This all takes place far away in space, and the two have a rather silly sense of humor too, so their views on things might be pretty weird at times.<br/></p>\n<p>The redhead, Sophie, is a lesbian. She may also be asexual if you so choose. You can control her character with the left, right and up arrow keys.<br/></p>\n<p>Bryn, Sophie's girlfriend, has no label for her sexual orientation. She kind of just likes people with some feminine traits, in a fuzzy way that both does and doesn't relate to gender.<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>I developed this game from scratch for the Queerly Representing the Unrepresented jam in 2018. I'll likely update the game quite a bit over time since it's rather incomplete in many ways and I intend to include it to my upcoming game, Rose Seed Replica, in a more polished form too.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98ad2a01fe86132e890e792e2c28cb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LezLiz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
