Constantly having to aim with the mouse, fire with the 'f' key, run around with the arrows and swap weapons using 1 2 3 and 4 keeps the players hand constantly jumping from place to place in a desperate attempt to survive only one more second. With only one hand, it's surely a game that plays like no other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5ce86b8ee87836b15d8686d35af8fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jiggly joe"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
