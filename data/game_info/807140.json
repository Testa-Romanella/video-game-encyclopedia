You can wishlist it here\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a stone's throw away.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to an unknown bargain, London now resides in a vast cavern under the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. The fabric of strait-laced Victorian society has begun to fray.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Masters are in charge. Why are they so\u2026 tall? And always cloaked? And why are they so interested in love stories?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe possibilities for personal connection in London are different now. Thrown together in crisis, you might befriend or romance many of the characters you meet, from Griz, your assertive housemate for whom the Fall was a chance to break free of Victorian societal norms, to the infernally well-dressed gentleman at the Brass Consulate with the amber eyes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven death itself has a twist here: the first murder victim since the Fall is feeling much better, and keen to see justice done. Unfortunately, as the doctor who treated him immediately before he expired, your housemate Archie is the prime suspect...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>(Re)invent yourself: who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?\n<br/>\n</li><li>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories to unlock different story options\n<br/>\n</li><li>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners, each with their own secrets\n<br/>\n</li><li>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself (by any definition you like)\n<br/>\n</li><li>Write love stories in a delightful minigame, and use them to impress the new Masters \n<br/>\n</li><li>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources. How are you at rat catching?\n<br/>\n</li><li>Solve the first murder since the Fall, with the assistance of the victim\n<br/>\n</li><li>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London\n<br/>\n</li><li>Seek deeper and deeper secrets over multiple playthroughs</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWill you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached? Or are you looking for lasting love? Perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way? Every major storyline is accessible regardless of whether your approach to love is romantic or platonic. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nUse an elaborate, dynamic story-crafting system to create love stories \u2013 and murder theories. Are the twists in the tale not to your taste? Then change the motive, the location, even the victim, and see how the stories adapt!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour past will open different doors for you in London. What was your life on the Surface like? Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or dabble in the occult? \n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour clothing will also make people think differently of you. Your outfits open new possibilities in conversation: be bolder, more commanding, more flirtatious. Ingratiate yourself with London's inhabitants by changing your style of dress \u2013 they won't be able to resist you in that hat!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll also work odd jobs and collect resources which will open new avenues in social situations. Your housemate Griz has found you work as census-taker for those curious new Masters. Fill your census-taker's notebook with intimate details about your fellow citizens and you'll find you can pursue deeper relationships with them, romantic or otherwise.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGriz\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall of London has been a liberation \u2013 the chance to throw off her corsets, dump the dresses and be taken seriously in a position that would have been forbidden to her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArchie\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your other housemate Archie, the change is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHarjit\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Fall struck, Harjit stepped up to help anyone who needed it. Now he\u2019s settling into his role as a man in uniform, but the territory is unfamiliar \u2013 and, secretly, he has a missing person of his own to find.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMilton\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMilton is the amber-eyed host of a literary parlour with a scalding handshake and a prior address in Hell. He\u2019s an excellent listener, but does he only want you for your soul?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel was halfway through her serialised novel when London fell and everything she was writing about was turned upside-down. Her publisher grows impatient. Fortunately (?) meeting Milton has rekindled her passion \u2013 for more than just writing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel\u2019s brother, and no fan of Milton, David is also destined to be Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim. When he returns from the dead, you can ask him all about it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHoratia\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. Since London fell, people need the security she offers more than ever. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Pages\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of London's new, mysterious \u201cMasters\u201d, Mr Pages has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting London\u2019s first post-Fall census! But why are its questions so concerned with the love-lives of London\u2019s citizens? How do people declare their affection, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetically speaking?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExplore this unique city in glorious, richly rendered 2D. Experience London through three seasons: the season of Confessions, the season of Yule, and the season of Love. Help establish the first Feast of the Rose, a festival of romance that will be celebrated in London for decades to come!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor players of Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, Mask of the Rose offers a chance to immerse yourselves in the city that founded this deep, dark, and marvellous universe. And for veteran players of the Fallen London browser game, it marks your first opportunity to visit the city just after it fell. But fear not: Mask of the Rose is an excellent introduction to the universe we\u2019ve been building for more than a decade, and you don\u2019t need to have played our other games first. Come on in. Most things won\u2019t bite, unless you want them to.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExplore the locales, lives, and loves of an impossible city. Exchange bon-mots with devils. Investigate the first murder where the victim can testify at the murderer\u2019s trial. Dive into the sunken ruins of poor drowned Parliament. And if you\u2019re truly reckless, fall in love.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T07:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe73c0ff6750090d7662ff426742eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 18}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Failbetter Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Failbetter Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
