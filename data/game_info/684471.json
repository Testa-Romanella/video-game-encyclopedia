In a peanut shell, it is \u201cwhat if <em>The Quiet Year</em>\u00a0was actually about filling in a shipping chart instead of a map\u201d.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar, a shipping chart is when you list all the important characters on a work on both sides of a big grid, and then figure out what every possible pairing would look like. They\u2019re very silly, but they let you travel off the beaten path of relationships and really figure out how everyone in a group fits together, and then generate an endless source of drama and\u00a0surprising relationship dynamics.\r\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s really why I\u2019ve made this game: I\u2019ve had so much joy reading about, considering, and developing relationships between characters in this fandom and past fandoms, and wanted to share that joy in a structured and fun way. I think the relationships are what make Blaseball\u2019s story work - the relationships between characters, and our relationships with their stories. Every triumph, tragedy, incineration, trade, and surprise is made real by believing in those connections.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We Found Each Other is specifically about a single Blaseball team, as it proceeds through the eras of blaseball - growing together, and then eventually falling apart. You can play it using an existing, beloved team, or use it to create a brand new team for you to fall in love with.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:57:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc7a4ae4741c215aa34ed0dc52c91454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starshinePerigee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
