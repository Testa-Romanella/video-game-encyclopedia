Yours will be no inevitable victory.&quot; - Mike Singleton 1984<br />\n&quot;Lords of Midnight does story-based, large-scope, high-fantasy warfare better than most titles I can think of, iOS or otherwise.&quot;<br />\n- Rating 4/5- PocketTactics.com<br />\n&quot;This is an outstanding remake and developer Chris Wild, should feel very proud of creating such a superb celebration of the man\u2019s work.&quot;<br />\n- Rating 8/10 - Metro<br />\n&quot;#1 - Top 5 iPhone and iPad games of the week&quot;<br />\n- AppMyWorld.com<br />\n&quot;If you&#39;re interested in classic games, especially fantasy and/or strategy games, Lords of Midnight is a must-have.&quot;<br />\n-  Rating 4/5 - TouchArcade.com<br />\n&quot;App of the Year!&quot;<br />\n- Rating 5/5, Mirror.co.uk<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s an unmissable remake.
