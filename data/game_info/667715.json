With three unique modes of play, you can choose to either wander the universe as a Commander in Earth\u2019s galactic force, Galactic Command, carrying out your duty of maintaining law and order in allied territories or explore the vast reaches of space. You make your own rules but step out of line and face a court-martial or worse, make a bad decision and your crew die. Decide what you want to do, where you want to go and how you\u2019re going to carry out your goals. Do you invade a planet today or join an NPC controlled force as they attack an enemy station deep in hostile territory? Do you mine for valuable Iridium or do you destroy hostile assets for experience points that eventually lead to increase in the ranks? You can also join a campaign in the Advanced Campaign Mode scenario consisting of a series of missions that are directly affected by the ever changing universe. You can either follow the mission path or ignore orders and move on to the next task in the campaign. To get you going and hone your combat skills, enter Xtreme Carnage and take on space and planetary hostiles as you familiarize yourself with the operation of your fighters. The choice is yours, either way, one day, you\u2019re going to die. You may as well die with a medal and for a good cause.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T02:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/875371061b70bc78164f1dbad375ab28.jpg", "website": "http://3000ad.com/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3000AD"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["3000AD"], "esrb_rating": null}
