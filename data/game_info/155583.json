I always imagined it to be a real plane, a fighter jet, space ship and what have you but it was always fun to let my imagination run wild. I tried to recreate that experience in Unity with this project. This is the first draft of the project, I want to make some more improvements on it in the future.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first level - Avoid the bubbles and head for the portal</p>\n<p>For the second level - its a surprise :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have Fun.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e2343537a565124595c62be6135805fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mooict"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
