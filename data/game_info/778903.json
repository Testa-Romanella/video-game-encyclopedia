The cathedral, once used as a monastery by a long-dead civilization, is not quite as safe as foolishly dreamt.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>Sunrise Tragedy is an Action-RPG featuring fast-paced, stamina-based combat. Explore a vast cathedral with interconnected areas full of terrifying monsters. Unlock new abilities, called Vampiric Powers, which can aid you in combat and in exploration.<br/><br/>Engage in brutal combat with powerful foes. Dodge the enemy's attacks with invincibility frames and make your own attacks when the timing is right. Use different moves depending on the situation to either stun the enemy by depleting their stamina, or go in for the kill by depleting their health.<br/><br/>Level up your stats in whichever way you desire. Use a wide variety of weapons, costumes, accessories, and spells to customize your own way of playing.<br/><br/>Interact with various NPCs to gain upgrades and buy from their shops. Form bonds with them to gain items and hear their philosophies amid the impending apocalypse.<br/><br/>This game also features an elaborate alchemy system, allowing you to brew potions that fit your build. You get a set amount of potions per spawn, and you decide the effects of the potion by choosing the ingredients. For example, a magic build may want to trade some health regeneration for MP regeneration, or in some areas you may want to include a cure for poison.</p>\n\n<p>RAR PASSWORD: 123</p>\r\nWishlist Us!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7deee9e863225f86fe144de9d118b412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeadlessTek"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
