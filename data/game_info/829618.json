This game was fun to create as it involved solving a\u00a0few technical challenges including:</p>\n<ul><li>How to clump players together - An average crowd position is calculated each frame (roughly the center), all crowd members will attempt move towards that point, collision will prevent them overlapping. Note that this target point can point to anywhere so the same code is used to target towers, enemy crowds and bosses.</li><li>How to allow the player to accumulate many hundreds of players in play - I solved this by having two types of crowd member, one that represents 10 points and another that represents units, so for example a 59 crowd score will be represented by 5 large crowd members and 9 small crowd members.</li><li>How to space the players without them stacking on top of each other - Now and again I\u00a0run a method which walks the crowd and pushes them down into the floor this usually spreads all crowd members out.</li><li>How to prevent players moving too far left and right off\u00a0the edges of the platform without being squashed together - If moving left / right and any crowd member hits the boundary then movement in that direction is immediately halted. Movement is not allowed again in that direction until the crowd members have moved back in the opposite direction.</li><li>Jumps in frame rate when large numbers of crowd members are spawned - Crowd members are created ahead of time and simply kept in a disabled state. When a new crowd member is required I\u00a0simply find one that is not enabled and enable it. This is commonly known as object pooling.</li></ul>\n<p>For those that haven't played any hyper casual games like\u00a0Crowd Masters the aim of the game is build your crowd up to as many members as possible whilst running the gauntlet. You avoid obstacles and collect extra crowd members by running through gates which supply them. Powerups are also included for a little extra fun. Currency earnt whilst playing can be used to increase your initial crowd size, increase your income and buy news skins.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also includes tonnes of different skins to unlock and customise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa683f79495bf7c0949ed3588d3d8d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrmop44"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
