In this mode, the heroes on both teams need to defend \n      their own portal while destroying the portal of the other team, with the \n      help of minions on each team. A single-player practice mode is also \n      available to master the different spells each hero has to offer. \n      Multiple hero options make this competitive fun for all ages!\n    </p><p>\n      The arcade-style Classic mode is also available, for any of those less \n      competitive moments. There are multiple levels in which you help \n      Tomeling survive, with varying difficulties that award more gold for \n      their toughness.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/004e6800c3076731f1b1acb8cfb2af31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
