{"id": 660854, "slug": "simpnot", "name": "Simpnot", "name_original": "Simpnot", "description": "\n<p>Simpnot is a project in progress which consists of a retro FPS inspired by games known as \"Boomer shooter\" (Quake, Dusk, Painkiller, etc).</p>\n<p>This prototype was made to validate some aspects of the gameplay, more specifically the core gameplay. It serves to answer the questions below:</p>\n<p>- The movement of player is fun?</p>\n<p>- Is the combat fast-paced?</p>\n<p>- The weapons are fun to use?</p>\n<p>- Has the game a good weapon variety?</p>\n<p>- How good is the visual/sound feedback?</p>\n<p>- Does the player \"feel\" each gun shot?</p>\n<p>- Does the gameplay remember other retro FPS games?</p>\n<p>As a prototype, this build only presents basic gameplay and outsourced assets, serving only to test the core. Any feedback would be very helpful, thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong> -Move forward<br/></p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> - Move backward<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> -\u00a0 Strafe left<br/></p>\n<p><strong>D</strong> -  Strafe right<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Left Ctrl</strong> - Crouch</p>\n<p><strong>Q </strong>- Dash</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> - Fire</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button</strong> - Zoom (Sniper only)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Wheel Forward</strong> - Next weapon<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Wheel Back</strong> - Previous weapon<br/></p>\n<p><strong>1 - 8</strong> - Switch to weapon...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Esc</strong> - Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T20:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d9cfe831b6a220a398e709df86c8be7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Leandro Exhumed"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
