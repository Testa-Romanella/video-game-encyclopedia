One player controls a ball that is able to change sizes. The ball also has the ability to\u00a0slowly move their farther to the right by decreasing and increasing in size. The other player has the ability to spawn obstacles that the ball must overcome with it's size changing ability.\u00a0\u00a0If the ball is\u00a0able to move off of the\u00a0right side of the screen, the player controlling the ball\u00a0wins the game.\u00a0\u00a0If the other player can\u00a0force\u00a0the ball to go\u00a0off of\u00a0the left side of the screen with obstacles, the player that controls the map wins\u00a0the game.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours\u00a0for\u00a0the VGDC Fall 2017 Proto Game Jam.
