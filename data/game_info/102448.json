Use your motion controllers to grab the wheel and steer! <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- L+R Grip Buttons = Materialize steering wheel and grab it.<br/>- R Trigger = Speed up<br/>- L Trigger = Slow down<br/>- Turn the wheel like you would a normal car but you can also pull towards you to fly up, or push away to fly down.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm just making this for my own pleasure in my free time so please note the following:</strong><br/>- This is probably poorly optimised. I have a GTX1080 so I have no idea how this runs on other systems and I have filled it full of volumetric lighting. :)<br/>- <strong>VR HMD + motion controllers required!</strong> I have an Oculus Rift + Touch and that is all I have tested on. Any Vive users just let me know any issues you have and I will try to fix as much as I can.<br/>- Updates may be infrequent and may stop suddenly altogether. <br/>- I made this in UE4 so if anyone is curious how I did something then I would be happy to try and explain.</p>\n<p><strong>-\"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\"</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/896c099f80512d412916b629e3051d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["katanalevy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
