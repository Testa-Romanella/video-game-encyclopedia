Chamber</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis is a Tech Demonstration of HYBRID Physical Locomotion Systems, where VR Interactions are implemented using Physics Simulation.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is not a game as of yet, just a tech demo, but the systems being implemented will be used in SLAYR, a VR FPS that I'm working on.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>There are multiple systems for you to test out here, including Locomotion, physical hands, weapons and obstacles.\r\n\t<br/>You can play around with all the items in the test chambers, even play mini-golf or tennis.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\tHow does the Locomotion work?\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe locomotion system is designed to allow you to realistically and naturally move around the scene, while still keeping the easy feel of the regular Directional control scheme that you're used to in most games.\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Walking</strong> is simple, just pushed your Left Stick in the direction you want to go and you'll start moving slowly.\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Sway</strong> in place to make your walk faster, this allows you to control the walk speed naturally, but not have to put much effort in like you would expect with Walk-In-Place movement.\r\n\t<br/><br/>You can also <strong>Run</strong> by jogging in place, it doesn't need to be obvious like you're in the gym, just a natural bounce frequency, remember your feet aren't tracked, so you barely even need to lift them.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\tWhat about the weapons?\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tObjects and Weapons must be held to use them\r\n\t<br/><br/>Keep your <strong>Grip Trigger</strong> held to hold an object in hand, <br/>Release the <strong>Grip Trigger</strong> to let go again.\r\n\t<br/><br/>Each object can have multiple <strong>Grip Points</strong>, these can be held by any hand, <br/>and each point can have it's own interaction.\r\n\t<br/><br/>Use your <strong>Main Trigger</strong> to interact with the current Grip Point that is held, <br/>This would usually pull the Firing Trigger on a gun.\r\n\t<br/><br/>The Firing Triggers actually have different <strong>Sensitivity</strong> on each gun, Meaning some guns can be fired with less <br/>pressure on the Trigger than others.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\tAdditional Interactions\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome Grip Points have other <strong>Interactions</strong>, like Torch lights on some weapons, <br/>and a button to activate Laser Swords.\r\n\t<br/><br/>Use your <strong>Main Trigger</strong> while not holding anything to grab <br/><strong>Special Points</strong> on some weapons, like foldable stocks, <br/>this only works while the other hand is holding the weapon.\r\n\t<br/><br/>If you're holding a Grab Point with both hands, <br/>the first hand will be the <strong>Primary</strong>, the second hand can then activate a secondary Interaction on some Points, like the torch on some pistols.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\t- CURRENT ISSUES -\r\n\r\n<p>\n<strong>SteamVR</strong> version will be made in a few days, I'm currently busy for a few days and cannot work so I got this version out as soon as possible!\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Scopes</strong> are currently not working, they work fine in my Editor, once I build the game they break, I'll figure it out before the SteamVR version is released.\r\n\t<br/><br/>The Physics is mostly reliable but can sometimes glitch out, I've done quite a lot to get it pretty stable, but it still has to account for all the limitations of a Physics Engine.\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Shoulder Logic</strong> hasn't been implemented yet, so Butt Stocks don't actually have any use yet.\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Fired Bullets</strong> aren't affected by the Gravity Zone, Bullet Cases and bounced Toy Bullets are.\r\n\t<br/><br/><strong>Animations</strong> are functional, but not near perfect, there's still much to do.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\n\t- For Controls see CONTROLS Image -\r\n\r\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Thanks for trying
