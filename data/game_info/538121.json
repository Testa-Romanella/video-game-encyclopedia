A very short-tempered wizard came up to you and asked you for some <em>eye of newt</em> because he needed it for the potion he was brewing.</p>\n<p>The brewery you work at, however, does <strong>not</strong> serve the eye of newt. So you told him this, and his face became bright red and he accused you of lying. After you showed him your entire stock. His face became even redder and he started to utter the killing curse. But, since he was too mad to focus, he misspoke, and said the wrong curse. He accidentally cursed everyone with <strong>indecision</strong>!</p>\n<p>No one will be able to make up their mind and what they want to order will <strong>constantly change.</strong> Serve the drink they want fast so they don't become impatient and give you a bad rating.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the new year's game jam, and I had a great time making it and testing it. If you really enjoyed it, feel free to leave a comment telling me this and maybe I\u00a0will consider making it into a full game. Thank you so much for playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8cba84601ca816debccbfbc3b26b402.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Cosmic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
