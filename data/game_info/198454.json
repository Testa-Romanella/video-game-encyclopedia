Use the mouse to move the camera. Walk up to NPCs to trigger dialogue and press [E] to scroll through the dialogue. Walking away from the NPCs will trigger the dialogue to disappear.\u00a0 At the end of the game, press [ESC] to gain control of the mouse again and\u00a0 move it out of the window.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Creators note: We're\u00a0 sorry for the control bugs.\u00a0\u00a0We no longer have access to the Unity software to fix it. This is the final version.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>DIRECTIONS: \u00a0Walk up to NPCs in the area to interact with them. Scroll through the dialogue to see if they will give you money or not. Move on to the next person, trash can or free\u00a0coin. Collect the required amount of money before the timer runs out to win the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BACKGROUND: You're a homeless woman who just started her period.
