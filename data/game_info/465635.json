However the world is a place full of distractions. Everything is trying to stop you and end your epic space adventure. Hacker, earthquakes and even a furious creature from underneath. Can you beat the game anyway?</p>\n<p>Control your space ship with \"W,A,S,D\" and shoot with \"Space\". Menus and \"real life\" problems can be solved by using your mouse. (Disclaimer: Some of your real life and personal problems\u00a0may not be solved by using a mouse. Nevertheless we recommend the usage of a computer mouse and not a living one if you want to try it regardless.)<br/></p>\n<p>\"You can\u00b4t pause a Space Shooter\" was created during the GMTK GameJam 2020 in about 30 hours by a team of five for fun. The theme for the Jam was \"Out of Control\". <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Real Human Games</strong><br/>Code&amp;Concept - Alexis Chopin<br/>2D Art - Joana Zimmermann<br/>3D Art - Maria Reinhardt<br/>Game Design - Wolfgang Lambotte<br/><br/>Sound&amp;Music - Gidon Wolff</p>\n\n<p>Links: <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Real Human Games</strong><br/>https://www.rehuga.com/<br/>https://twitter.com/ReHuGa_official?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gidon Wolff</strong><br/>https://www.gidonwolff.de/<br/>https://twitter.com/GidonWolff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57d/57d8348c91255ad6770acf43b16cfdbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Real Human Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
