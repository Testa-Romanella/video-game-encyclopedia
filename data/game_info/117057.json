If you see and time in your head (there\u2019s a little random here to prevent it to be too easy!) you can time their attack to rush them and easily kill and retreat before their next shot!</p><p>\r\n\tPurples ennemies only first in the angle from where they come, they don\u2019t shot directly at you so they have a lot of dead angles you can exploit to never get hit by them!</p><p>\r\n\tYou should take time to analyze the pattern of mini boss and final boss to be better against them.</p><p>\r\n\tThere is no attempt to story at any moment but the closer is that some planet is invaded by something and we fight that fight because we want to help our planet! Still a better story than\u2026</p><p>\n<strong>Pro tips :</strong></p><p>\r\n\tAfter testing many times the game I came up with some tactics to finish it and tips for those who want it !</p>1\u00b0) You should not try to finish the game at first. Your first goal is to farm up research points to upgrade your ships.<p>\n<strong>Ships and build to farm</strong></p><p>\r\n\tUnder 10 points : You will have to max attack 1 in most of case, reason is that attacks 2 rely on energy and you can\u2019t afford to upgrade 2 bars with less than 10 points.</p><ul>\n<li>Boko can be a good first try. Max shield and attack 1 and you should be able to survive for a while but you can\u2019t kill too many. You REALLY need at least 5 points in attack 1 to farm with it, no energy no attack 2</li> <li>Kronos is really a good farming ship\u2026 it\u2019s amazing how much sustain you got but you have to be really nervous, max attack 1, a bit of attack 2 if you wanna jump a bit more and a bit of energy if you wanna spam it.</li> <li>Orbital\u2019s is my choice under 10 points. Give him some shield to tank up, 3-4 on attack 1 and a bit of speed! You don\u2019t need much points to do A LOT of damage but your key goal will be speed and timing. You\u2019ll have to time ennemies\u2019 attack to rush them and destroy them. If you have this timing in head it\u2019s an amazing ship with tons of fun!</li></ul><p>\n<strong>20+ Research points :</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Boko gains a whole new dimension. You can now afford to upgrade a bit of energy (at least 4 or 5 if you want to have 0 in attack 1) and at least 5-6 in Attack 2. Then you\u2019re free to upgrade shield or life depending of what you prefer. This is super good ship because you can kill ships from sides being under them so out of their range. You will need some speed to avoid shoots or really good timing. I prefer more damage but more timing. With this build you should do a massacre in ennemy lines.</li> <li>Kronos is maybe the easiest ship with 20 + but he has A LOT of tactics inside! Indeed you can upgrade attack 1 really high and afford shield + life or speed as you want but where it becomes great is that you can chain teleport really far away and spam in the 4 corners, really nervous, really quick, many kills in sight!</li> <li>Orbital : There\u2019s 2 possibilities here, or you max attack 1 and your defense or your max completely attack 2 and energy. First one is so powerfull and so tanky but needs a lot of timing, you can\u2019t afford any mistake. Second one is really safe, stay away and laser out everyone!!</li></ul>2\u00b0) With this farm you should have at least since the middle of level 2!<p>\r\n\tNow to get to level 3 and get the boss you just have to\u2026. keep your best ship and try to survive!</p><p>\r\n\tTo get it really easily you will need to have at least 5 bombs I think. Orbital is really difficult against mini boss and final boss without laser. You can with many speed but so dangerous! Kronos is the easiest for mini boss and final boss and Boko\u2019s attack 2 may do the job too, skill needed anyway!</p><p>\r\n\tHere you go, you\u2019re ready to survive, maybe?</p><p>\r\n\tgood luck guys =)\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cddb0b0dcc4ccf2bdedc080a39033e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xsoul"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
