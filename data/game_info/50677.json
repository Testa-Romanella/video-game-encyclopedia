{"id": 50677, "slug": "superhot-mind-control-delete", "name": "Superhot: Mind Control Delete", "name_original": "Superhot: Mind Control Delete", "description": "<p>MIND CONTROL DELETE is a standalone expansion set in the SUPERHOT universe. It\u2019s designed as a rogue-like twist on the linear nature of the original SUPERHOT. In it\u2019s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.<br />\nThe game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.<br />\nCome and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?<br />\nWe\u2019re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don\u2019t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we\u2019re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:<br />\nFirst 2 playable MINDS, each with it\u2019s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers<br />\nA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges<br />\nNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types<br />\nHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you<br />\nProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay<br />\nBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:<br />\nNo story whatsoever - we don\u2019t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features<br />\nNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates<br />\nNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait<br />\nAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho &lt;3<br />\nIf you\u2019re not looking for an incomplete game that\u2019s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you\u2019d rather just play a finished experience that\u2019s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.<br />\nHowever, if you\u2019re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?<br />\nWe released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.<br />\nWith morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren\u2019t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.<br />\nThe single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we\u2019re now ready to start this adventure together again. We\u2019re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let\u2019s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What\u2019s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?<br />\nYup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it&#39;ll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you\u2019ll get the full expansion for free once it\u2019s finished and released.<br />\nHowever if you can\u2019t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we\u2019ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.<br />\nOnce MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who\u2019s still new to the franchise.FAQ<br />\nShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven\u2019t played the original SUPERHOT?<br />\nNot right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It\u2019s lots of fun.<br />\nWhat\u2019s the update roadmap?<br />\nWe\u2019re new to Early Access, but we\u2019re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we\u2019ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.<br />\nI really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?<br />\nThe discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We\u2019ll tap into your creative hivemind. We\u2019ll put your ideas into life.<br />\nYour mind will make the system stronger. You will be ONE OF US.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T04:09:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b56/b56853f28ecdc04b44f552f7b9c8ea69.jpg", "website": "http://superhotgame.com", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 201, "owned": 2904, "beaten": 256, "toplay": 104, "dropped": 156, "playing": 45}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 364, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 372, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["SUPERHOT Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SUPERHOT Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
