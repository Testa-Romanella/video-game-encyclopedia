Every Party Member represents one heart - if all the Party Members die, it's a Game Over.</p>\n<p>Each round is cleared by killing all the enemies until they stop spawning.\u00a0To win the game, the Party must reach Round 10 to conquer Goblin\u00a0Castle and win the Underworld War.</p>\r\nMOVEMENT\r\n<p>All the characters receive the same player input, but each character moves separately. Guide them through the levels to go around obstacles and to dodge enemy attacks.</p>\r\nATTACKING THE ENEMY\r\n<p>Goblin will appear from left and right, moving across the screen and stopping before firing an arrow.</p>\n<p>To kill an enemy, one of the characters has to touch the enemy. Every enemy kill will award the player some gold.\u00a0</p>\r\nGETTING ATTACKED\r\n<p>Goblins will charge an arrow and fire it across the screen. If an arrow touches a character, that character dies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goblins will telegraph their arrow shot by stopping before firing.</p>\r\nIntermission\r\n<p>Between rounds, the player will encounter locations the Party has stumbled upon.</p>\r\nVILLAGE\r\n<p>A\u00a0peaceful village not touched by war.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For 50 gold, the player can hire another Adventurer to join the Party. It will become necessary to replenish the ranks.</p>\r\nCATHEDRAL\r\n<p>A\u00a0dark place where life is sacrificed for power.</p>\n<p>At the cost of 2 Party Members, the player can receive a Potion of Invincibility. A\u00a0trade-off between more Hearts and an useful Item.</p>\n<p>Cathedrals will appear only twice during the game.</p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>As I write this I am incredibly tired. But I am also very proud!</p>\n<p>It's a very difficult, hardcore game, but I feel like I've really accomplished something interesting in here.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T05:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b01f8fdd16df408b8a6016ed3b6f5f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
