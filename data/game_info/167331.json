What isn't fully fleshed out is what sort of things the mechs can be used for as the current focus is on the mech building.<br/><br/><strong>Planned Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Building mechs from scratch with steel beams, electronics, power plants, weapons, armor plates, button consoles, and more.</li><li>Physically simulated walking.</li><li>Little to no limitations on mech design. Have as many legs, cockpits, parts as you want.</li><li>Multiplayer.</li><li>Programmable electronics components.</li><li>Heat simulation based on real world values including heat capacity and melting points.</li><li>Heat management via heat sinks and heat pumps.</li></ul>\n<p>The goal is to have a nice balance of complexity, realism, simplicity, and fun. For example, walking will be physically simulated but automatically controlled by parts called Locomotion Controllers that will make getting a mech going easier. Balance will be mostly handled by gyroscopic balance modules so as long as you are close, you can get your mech walking.</p>\n<p>The building system is basically complete so the current focus is on new parts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prototype Notes</strong>:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Press 1</strong> to select the Moving Tool. Simple Click and drag usage.<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Press 2</strong> to select Assembly Tool</em></p>\n<p><em>To connect frames...</em><br/></p>\n<p>1. Hover over a frame to highlight open hardpoints. The closest open hardpoint will be selected. Hold shift to highlight the second closest.</p>\n<p>2. Left click to select the highlighted hardpoint.</p>\n<p>3. Hover over a second frame to show the ghost of the first frame.</p>\n<p>4. Press R to rotate the ghost. Hold shift to position the ghost at the second closest open hardpoint.</p>\n<p>5. Left Click to commit the new connection.</p>\n<p><em>To disconnect frames...</em><br/></p>\n<p>1. Hover over a frame and press ctrl to switch to connection highlighting. Looking at a different frame will reset to hardpoint highlighting.</p>\n<p>2. Left Click to disconnect the highlighted connection or press ctrl again to return to hardpoint highlighting.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Press 3</strong> to selec</em><em>t the Linker Tool. Use this to set values and make connections between parts.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Press 4</em>\u00a0</strong><em>to select the Part Spawner. Use to spawn parts.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Motor bases have a power connection on the back that can be connected to power connections on the Electrical Panel. Attaching an electrical\u00a0panel to something is a quick way to create and more electric hardpoints.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Energy usage and heat have not been balanced yet so your motor will get red over time due to heat. This doesn't effect anything yet. All objects have a surface area that accounts for how fast they cool via air cooling. Moving objects cool off faster.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Movement...</em></p>\n<p>Basic WASD and Space to move. Your character has a ground-effect jetpack that will allow you to hover a certain height above whatever is below you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Press Left-Ctrl+C</strong> to copy the looked at mech to a file called Mech.json.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Press Left-Ctrl+V</strong> to load the mech saved in the Mech.json file.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Press Left-Ctrl+Z</strong> to copy all parts to a file called Scene.json.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Press Left-Ctrl+L</strong> to clear the current scene and load the scene saved in the Scene.json file.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Press Left-Ctrl+M</strong> to merge the scene saved in the Scene.json file into the current scene.</em></p>\n<p>It is possible to manage multiple saves by renaming the Mech.json file.</p>\n<p>Please leave a comment if you have any questions!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f279adcb0eee60b2eb4ad63b04ed3d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatherlyAT"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
