{"id": 16168, "slug": "beep", "name": "BEEP", "name_original": "BEEP", "description": "<p>BEEP is an indie 2D platformer with a heavy reliance on physics laws. Big Fat Alien developed this title, and it is the only one within the IP. The game is considered to be attractive for such titles: not only it has music written primarily for it, but also the game flow feels like the one in &quot;big&quot; games. The main reception flaw is that game suits a lot more to the mobile platforms.<br />\nThe core gameplay feature is the ability to alter the laws of the physics. There is an anti-gravity gun to do this \u2014 other than that it is just a general side-scroller platforming gameplay: the player needs to eliminate enemies, collect orbs to discover new planets and solve various physics puzzles.<br />\nThe story is about the robot, BEEP, , sent into the Solar System to discover new planets and the possibility of life there. Once the Beep has unraveled the new planet, he checks on its physics and flies over to the next one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55e5628270e3a9d586c26bb2394801ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.92, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 80, "owned": 1815, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 31}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 99, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 99, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Fat Alien"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Fat Alien", "Big Fat Alien, Sunken Treasure Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
