Look for firewood and fuel the flame or you will have to put it in again.<br/><br/><strong>Cooperation or betrayal? </strong><br/>Only you can decide which side to choose. Will you work with your team or betray them when you have a chance? Maybe, you are a good orator and want to build a good trustworthy team? Or do you prefer to create tension and distrust? Anyway, it is you who makes the final decision.<br/><br/><strong>Features of survival</strong><br/>Appearing in a cosy home with your unlucky teammates, you have to find a way out and collect wood for the fireplace to get warm (you don\u2019t want to freeze to death, do you?). Also, you\u2019ll come across some useful items such as food and additional clothes. But make sure that you\u2019re not lost while searching the way to other houses.<br/><br/><strong>What is hiding in the forest?</strong><br/>Yes, there are \u201chuman-monsters\u201d, but also there are ghosts of darkness, which are also dangerous.
