Six months later it hadn&#39;t met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  </p>\n<p>Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company&#39;s London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.</p>\n<p>(&quot;Obra&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Cobra&quot; without the C).</p>\n<p>From the author:</p>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<p>I want to challenge myself so this&#39;ll be a very different game from anything I&#39;ve done before, including Papers Please. There&#39;ll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I&#39;m hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won&#39;t be the typical &quot;collect items and look for clues&quot; structure. There&#39;s a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won&#39;t go into details on that until much later.</p>\n<p>Devlog</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won&#39;t be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I&#39;m able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there&#39;s less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it&#39;ll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.</p>\n<p>1-bit Rendering</p>\n<p>My first computer was a Mac Plus. I&#39;ve always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I&#39;d like to capture the detailed black &amp; white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn&#39;t scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p>\n<p>Unity 3D</p>\n<p>I&#39;m gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it&#39;s time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I&#39;ve played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2018-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-31T10:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/052/052f9afc7aaeea3e2c5d46eafa92c64e.jpg", "website": "https://obradinn.com", "rating": 4.36, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 201, "owned": 1351, "beaten": 549, "toplay": 567, "dropped": 137, "playing": 49}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 702, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 716, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["3909", "Lucas Pope", "dukope"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["3909"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
