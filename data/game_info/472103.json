When you shoot (left mouse button), your heat increases. If your heat goes above the constraints of the bar, you will overheat. While in this state, you will take continuous damage.</p>\n<p>If your HP is below 0, you lose.</p>\n<p>It fits because the gun is unstable: it can damage the player if not used carefully.<br/></p>\n<p>Some things appear to be a darker shade of blue than the rest. That's just an illusion: the bullets can look darker because they're moving so fast on a dark background and the text looks darker because it's so thin. Taking a screenshot and zooming in shows that they are the same colour. (So does looking at the code, main.js line 300 is the only time context.fillStyle and context.strokeStyle are mentioned)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d87375b8a753c66870e6e0d5feaac83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CosmoBrain"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
