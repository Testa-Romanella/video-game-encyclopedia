{"id": 402733, "slug": "threads-of-magic-and-memory", "name": "Threads of Magic and Memory", "name_original": "Threads of Magic and Memory", "description": "<p>\"Threads of Magic and Memory\" is a character-driven interactive fiction game which follows an old warrior named Adisa as she explores a mind-and-reality-warping dungeon in the hopes of forgetting her past. As you unravel her extremely complicated history, you\u2019ll explore a dungeon that bends the rules of reality, use magic built of threads that weave through the air, and meet a small cast of engaging characters while analyzing themes of trauma and guilt, with a touch of horror thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>The story is more emotion and character-focused than gameplay-oriented, though it should still provide the split decisions and branching paths that make interactive storytelling so special. Play-times should average 30 minutes, depending upon your choices and reading speed. The programmer threw in a couple of neat technical tricks that should catch your eye, too.<br/><br/>\"Threads of Magic and Memory\" was developed in Twine Harlowe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99ffd1e45b2e2c1471dfaa69c8b945af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["C.J.
