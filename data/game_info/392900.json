I'm almost afraid to change them.</p><p>Collisions are wonky and hacky.\u00a0 Yes, the car is actually 2 x 4 pixels and the view is a zoomed-in 128 x 72 pixels.\u00a0 I did all the movements in sub-pixels.\u00a0 When it came time to code the collisions, precise wasn't precise and things got really weird.\u00a0 I'm only a hobbyist, so this was beyond my grasp, so I just fudged it and got things \"close enough\".\u00a0 I'd like to get it better, but I'm unfortunately currently at a loss (not to mention a bit lazy. :/ ).\u00a0 If I keep going, I have a feeling there might need to be a big rework.\u00a0 To be honest,\u00a0I'm on the fence, here.</p><p>The direction arrows pointing you to the disturbances don't wrap, and that bugs me.\u00a0 I think I can work out the math to get it working, but I didn't even attempt it.\u00a0 So after playing for a while, you start to try to go the opposite way of the arrows if you think they're far enough away, since that would be the quicker route.\u00a0 Sometimes it worked, but sometimes travelling across the room corners made things really confusing as the arrows would flip to the other side of the screen.\u00a0 It added an element of game play, but probably not a very positive one.\u00a0 lol</p><p>Room wrapping was a fun chore.\u00a0 I made a script for all the objects to draw themselves a second time if the edge of the room came into view.\u00a0 Basically, when the room's edge is within the view, any object which appears outside the room is being drawn twice.\u00a0 This could be coded much more efficiently, but Mr. Jamtime says, \"No!\"\u00a0 The streets inside the room are tiles, but outside the room is a \"sprite_created_from_surface\" of the entire street grid, made with 16 x 16 street sprites and for loops.\u00a0 It's way overboard, but it\u00a0was the simplest and fastest way\u00a0I could think to do it.\u00a0 Actually, it was the only way I could think to do it.</p><p>Well, I'm sorry.\u00a0 This has become long-winded and self-indulging.\u00a0 If you made it though all this, I give you a big Thank You!\u00a0 I really enjoyed making \"What's Your 20?\" and wish I had another week until deadline.\u00a0 I want to keep working on it, but I also want to go back to my HippyBus project.\u00a0 On top of that, the GMC Jam is only days away and I won't be missing that one, either.\u00a0 Good thing this is only a hobby I do for fun, eh?\u00a0 (Consuming, sleep-deprived, hair-pulling, socially-unrelatable FUN!)</p><p>Be your best you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67acbd007cd225eebf2ad025349239e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["haymanmarc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
