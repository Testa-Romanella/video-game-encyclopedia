Players will catch Pok\u00e9mon by moving the Nintendo 3DS to \n      discover hidden Pok\u00e9mon in the Interdream Zone, a place between reality \n      and dreams. Players can catch the Pok\u00e9mon by moving the Nintendo 3DS to \n      aim and shoot beams at them. Pok\u00e9mon caught using the Pok\u00e9mon \n      Dream Radar can be transferred into Pok\u00e9mon \n      Black Version 2 and Pok\u00e9mon \n      White Version 2, helping players build their roster of Pok\u00e9mon. \n      Pok\u00e9mon Dream Radar also includes some hard-to-get Pok\u00e9mon, giving \n      players even more incentive to catch them for their Pok\u00e9mon Black \n      Versions 2 and Pok\u00e9mon White version 2 games.
