I created a 32x32 file and started drawing random stuff and erasing it. (I am not an artist in the slightest). I then went from thinking about an entire image to just the pixels themselves. I wondered, what can I do with 1,024 pixels? It seems like a lot of squares to work with. That's when I decided to make a maze.</p><p>In the game the maze and the character sprites are blown up 1600% so you can see what you're doing.</p><p>It was a fun way to spend a few hours as I wait for work to let out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93bb3d0008db842a85a3f5a826477e16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMP|Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
