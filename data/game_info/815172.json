Do you have what it takes to stop it in time?<h3>Race Against the Clock</h3><br/>With every passing second, the virus spreads. Destroy enemies as quickly as possible while dodging their attacks by dashing and warping between planets in adrenaline-pumping combat encounters. Your contagion meter tracks the progress of the infection throughout the sector. Time is of the essence--if the meter fills, it's game over.<h3>Explore the Galaxy</h3><br/>Each run takes place on a procedurally generated map filled with a variety of vendors to help you accomplish your mission of clearing out all hostile enemies in the sector. Choose your path strategically! Each encounter gives the virus time to progress.<h3>Upgrade Your Ship</h3><br/>Your ship is equipped with augment slots that allow you to strengthen the effect of your weapons and dash. Enemies drop scrap when destroyed that can be used to buy stronger augments from vendors and other outposts that you encounter during your run. Discover synergies and over-powered combinations to wipe out enemy hordes with ease.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T03:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13c7eea5f32220db5e853fe983ed8a4a.jpg", "website": "https://williamg.me/games/exodemic/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ganashaw"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ganashaw"], "esrb_rating": null}
