It's probably my way of expressing myself.\u00a0When I\u00a0saw the theme, at first I\u00a0was pretty disappointed, because I\u00a0didn't know how I\u00a0could turn it into something that represents me.\u00a0Then I had this weird idea of making your own princess based on your inputs. Go play and create yours! Pay attention to the reaction of your friend\u00a0at the end of the game. There are several depending on your score!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Arrow keys and A-B-X-Y</p>\n<p>- Or joystick! (on the Windows standalone only: download it at\u00a0https://arthurcousseau.com/unity/brackeysgamejam2/app.zip)</p>\n<p>P.S: sorry for the bad graphics\u00a0that do not really let you distinguish a pretty princess from an ugly one.\u00a0I'm certainly the worst graphist in Europe. I hope you had a good time playing that thing, though!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c4881980b64ec460253bfb5e0ab34baf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eldoir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
