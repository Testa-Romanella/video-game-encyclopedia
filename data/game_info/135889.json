The theme was \"Ancient Technology\". An online version \r\n\there\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou are a student and your teacher ask you to solve some rope linking problems for his future flying machine. As you advance in your studies, the problems become harder and new kind of ropes appear.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a puzzle game in which you have to understand what are the rules assigned to each rope. A second goal is to use as little ropes as possible. The score is printed for each level at the top right hand corner and at the end of the game, you have the total number of ropes used. Share it in the comments :)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tGood Luck :)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you enjoy the game, you can also create your own puzzles (only with the exe version). To do so, you have to create a text file. A puzzle is represented on a single line (you can have multiple line in a single file). You have 10 numbers for the ropes followed by 10 numbers for the pulleys (0 there is no pulley, 1 there is a pulley). For the ropes, here is the encoding :\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t0 = no rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t1 = black rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t2 = blue rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t3 = green rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t4 = orange rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t5 = red rope\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tExample :\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t0 1 2 1 4 1 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThen, once you have your puzzle file, from the main menu, press P to go to the customized puzzle mode. Choose your text file and enjoy ;)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can share your challenges in the comments for more fun :D\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tTools used:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGame Maker\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPhotoshop\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAudacity\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBrain\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afa7da6c1a3424cb3e6086682126bfff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Aun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
