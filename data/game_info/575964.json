I added the insect monsters, made by Maksim Bugrimov so I could have something a bit more interesting to do AI experiments with.</p>\n<p>Originally I had UFPS implemented which had a complete combat cycle with the bugs, but ran into an issue that I'm waiting on support on. If I can get it fixed I will republish with combat re-enabled, and probably add swimming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/8114173db439c10ea94303a4914b1f40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rtwarner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
