Gamers both young and old will enjoy the action packed combat, colorful cast of robot characters, and ability to play with friends remote or on the couch side-by-side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The story is set in the year 2083 and follows a young robot named TOM, who is thrust into battle when his home is attacked by hordes of mindless robots called G.A.R.D. units. The intruders are searching for a super computer named MOTHER, which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in TOM\u2019s home, the mega corporation known as Innovation Robotics. As the Bot TOM and his companion robots BRI, RED, and STU defend Innovation Robotics, they encounter and rescue helpful robots called Robofriends. The Bots must embark on a rescue mission to save their home, save the Robofriends, and track down and defeat the sinister G.A.R.D captains who have taken over Innovation Robotics. <br/><br/>As you explore Innovation Robotics, you will find helpful robots called Robofriends. Even though they are not made to battle, the Robofriends rise to action when rescued. Robofriends provide unique ways to aid you against the invading enemies, such as healing your Bot, protecting with a bubble shield, or even blasting your enemies with fire! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Play by yourself or with friends picking from one of the four robot characters, TOM, BRI, RED, and STU. With each characters\u2019 unique attributes and attacks there are lots of combinations when using Robofriends in combat. <br/><br/><br/>TOM is a young and kind-hearted robot, who has only been activated for a short amount of time. TOM uses close range melee attacks, and when the enemy moves far away, he will throw his plasma buzz-saw like a disc at the enemy. <br/><br/><br/>She's electric with a personality to match, BRI is one tough robot. BRI uses mid-range electric attacks and will zap enemies around her when she is attacked with an electric discharge. <br/><br/><br/>An ex-mlitary solider who became a receptionist, STU is a powerful and proud defender. STU is a precision attacker using rapid fire dual lazor cannons. <br/><br/><br/>One of the oldest robots made, RED is a battle-hardened solider experienced in combat. RED utilizes rockets with remote detonation and splash damage to attack enemies from long range. <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Up to four players in all game modes - Local co-op and Remote Play<br/></li><li> Classic top-down levels with updated mechanics<br/></li><li> Fully voiced in game dialog and cut-scenes.<br/></li><li> Featuring music artist Scandroid and his track Empty Streets from the album Neo Tokyo <br/></li><li> Explore Innovation Robotics - choosing different paths in story mode and procedurally generated arcade mode.<br/></li><li> Discover multiple story endings<br/></li><li> Arcade style drop-in and drop-out play.<br/></li><li> Over 20 different Robofriends with unique abilities to collect.<br/></li><li> 100 floors of Arcade mode - how long you can survive?<br/></li><li> A tribute to the 80's with a New Retro Wave style soundtrack.</li></ul><br/><h3>Story Mode</h3>Fully voiced motion comics tell the story of the Bots in B.O.T.S. and the Robofriends.
