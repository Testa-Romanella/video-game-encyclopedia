The distance was the hardest thing to implement because if it was randomly generated the planets would over lap and explode (not really). So I came up with a function that gives me the minmum distance the planets can have from each other proportionate to their size. I used really advanced math by plotting the graph and drawing a straight line connecting them(turned out to be linear).</p><p>My brother helped me a lot on the graphical stuff, almost all of the sprites and backgrounds he drew them on paint.net. He also helped me code some functions here and there.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>To Do:</p><ul>\n<li>seeds</li><li>Planet colors</li><li>Toogle the menu using esc key</li><li>Main menu</li><li>Planet texture :o</li></ul><p>My email: j850729@hotmail.com</p><p>By me and my brother</p><p>Version 0.0.2 </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0642cd3d0da662454c44e68175d206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jgansaown"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
