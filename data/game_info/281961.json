It is an infinite 2D platformer game built on Unity with C#, comprised of five unlock-able levels of increasing difficulty. The player\u2019s objective is to progress upwards from platform to platform, collecting resources until all three constantly depleting resource bars are full. Meanwhile, the player must not fall off the platforms, ensure that none of the resource bars are ever fully depleted, and avoid damage from enemies. The game has a system that keeps track of each level\u2019s highest scores, as well as a settings system that allows the player to specify the volume level and which character they would like to play as.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f077b0b80e9eb6db4bf0299239a68059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dhennem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
