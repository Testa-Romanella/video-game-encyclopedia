The ship is on fire and you are quickly approaching a black hole. Luckily, you are still receiving transmissions from Command HQ. You must interpret the instruction sent via signal transmissions correctly to fix your ship in time! Signals you receive will instruct you to move in the direction of a new grid tile, move to a colored wire and then cut or connect the wire.
