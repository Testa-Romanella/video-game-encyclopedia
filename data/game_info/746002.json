Just look for the floating circles and arrows. After your move, each floor will shift based upon the arrows above - floors are only affected by markers which line up with rooms of the same colour.</p>\n<p>You win the game if you can survive 30 turns!</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>The game was supposed to take only 3 hours to make but took closer to 6 - There was so much I wanted to add, including an increasing level of difficulty with more quakes as time goes on. There are also a few sprites which ended up being unused, including destruction particles and building details.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Font: Fluoxetine by \"Apostrophic Labs\"</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/fluoxetine-font.html</p>\n<p>Font: Yumaro by \"Monoco Type Foundry\"</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/yumaro-font.html</p>\n<p>Music: Ruined City by \"Cleyton Kauffman\"</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/ruined-city-theme</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Sounds: \"The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection\" by Juhani Junkala\r\n</p>\n<p>Sprites/Game - Made in Unity by Toby Kellaway\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T04:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0b4091f0eceb932b66553a5c420fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tkellaway"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
