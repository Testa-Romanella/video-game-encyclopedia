I use it as a tool when talking at Catholic schools or whatnot.</p><p><strong>THEMATIC ELEMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Saint Francis of Assisi\u2019s brilliant iteration of praises (\u201cthe Canticle of the Creatures\u201c) as well as\u00a0Zeffirelli\u2019s 1972\u00a0film\u00a0<em>Brother Sun, Sister Moon</em>\u00a0provided the inspiration for\u00a0<em>Friar Dude</em>\u2018s graphical styling. The first three levels\u00a0represent the \u201cBrother Sun\u201d aspect of the Canticle, while the final three levels represent \u201cSister Moon\u201d. The falling obstacles\u00a0represent five specific\u00a0activities\u00a0of the Capuchin Franciscans in my province (Capuchin Soup Kitchen,\u00a0JPIC / Social Justice, Pastoral Work, reading, and studying). The falling collectibles represent rest (catching Z\u2019s), the Holy Spirit (the dove + flames), and extra lives (heart).</p>\n<p>The game demonstrates the major stages of Capuchin formation. The player moves from postulancy to novitiate to simple vows to perpetual vows and ends with a final sprint into the afterlife. This provided a basic \u201ceducational\u201d element to the game. So many people ask me, \u201cwhat is the process of becoming a friar?\u201d. From now on, I can refer them to this game. Some friars have jokingly suggested that the game should be a screening process for incoming candidates.</p>\n<p>Additionally,\u00a0the title track\u00a0from\u00a0<em>Friar Dude</em>\u00a0was essentially an 8-bit styling of\u00a0Donovan\u2019s classic rendition\u00a0of \u201cBrother Sun, Sister Moon\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8ab56b9e5eaad926316c861fc081c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Friar Babs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
