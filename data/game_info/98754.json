Unlike other games that have the player wandering through a world without impacting it, Orbys will let the player have a real, tangible effect on the environment. In fact, it's required to get through puzzles that are integrated directly into the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow us!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Steam, and\u00a0Youtube\u00a0for updates, Twitch for live chats and development streams, or to just interact with the team.
