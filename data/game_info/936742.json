Customers will order what they want and it's your job to get it for them. Giving customers the wrong order will cause them to leave without paying. Every day you need to pay rent for the facility and if you don't make enough money you. Customers will sometimes leave trash after them and during closing hours you will have to pick the trash up, otherwise less new customers will want to come to the bar.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours as part of the \"Climax GameJam 2023\". The theme was \"Shift\" and we began thinking about different ways to approach the theme.\u00a0 After ruling out games about shifting time or a game where dashing is the most important mechanic we settled on a game where you have a job working a shift. It was an interesting game to make and if we had more time it would have been interesting to introduce more gameplay areas, like having to restock items when they run out. having bad customers that cause trouble, etc. But overall we are proud of what we were able to do in such a short time span.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27b3ee618b8d15c1ade76d83b561f90d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["noodle3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
