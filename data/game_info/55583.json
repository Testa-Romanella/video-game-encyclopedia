The Japanese arcade release was published by Konami.</p>\n<p>The graphical animations for the player character and opponents were created through a bluescreen process, where the various poses and moves of the characters were acted out by hired actors in front of a video camera. The game's on-screen character animation are replays of the actual footage, not a rotoscoped (redrawn) animation as was common in other games. Pit-Fighter was the second fighting game to use digitized sprites, after Home Data's Reikai D\u014dshi: Chinese Exorcist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34b6172b4f6efbad04ba2572e2002a25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "SEGA Master System", "Atari ST", "Game Boy", "Atari Lynx", "SNES", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Atari Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Konami", "Atari", "Tengen"], "esrb_rating": null}
