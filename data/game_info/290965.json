{"id": 290965, "slug": "clash-battle-arena", "name": "CLASH! - Battle Arena", "name_original": "CLASH! - Battle Arena", "description": "CLASH! is a fast-paced fighting game where instead of memorizing inputs and combos, the game will test your observation skills, spacing and reaction time. The low entry barrier makes it perfect for picking up and playing with your friends in local multiplayer, or you can hone your skills in the single-player training mode. The Stance System blocks attacks from the same stance automatically, so you must either create an opening or outmaneuver your opponent to seize victory. Being able to gain and capitalizing on frame advantage is the key to victory. And if you're timing is perfect, you are able to counter incoming attacks to regain the initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES:<br/>\r\n- Intense local multiplayer action!<br/>\r\n- A single-player training mode against an AI opponent.<br/>\r\n- Three degrees of AI difficulty (Novice, Intermediate, Expert)<br/>\r\n- An optional tutorial to teach new players the mechanics and get them into the fight ASAP.<br/>\r\n- Full controller and keyboard support for up to two players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-12T12:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5bec44e5a0556a477d3210c308ded398.jpg", "website": "https://masonbutterwick.wixsite.com/clash", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MasonButterwick", "Mason Butterwick"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mason Butterwick"], "esrb_rating": null}
