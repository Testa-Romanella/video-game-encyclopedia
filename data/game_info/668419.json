We made this game in about 3 weeks (more like 1 considering how much i procrastinated but ANYWAY) for the great autum game jam 2021! The game is, as you will be able to tell, not even close to being finished. I don't know if I'll update it in the future but if i do, updates would include:<br/></p>\n<p>- NPC's in the village with narrative elements<br/></p>\n<p>- A day system where you're supposed to gather enough nuts before winter<br/></p>\n<p>- More gameplay variations (rain, frozen leaves, wind, you know the drill)<br/></p>\n<p>- And even more bugs! (probably) c:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A and D / Q and D to move left and right, space to jump and hold space while in the air to use your glider! And your mouse to navigate the menus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sound and music:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Zapsplat.com\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Game made by:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>https://twitter.com/thewildeus<br/></p>\n\n<p>https://twitter.com/cocoaniable<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Special thanks to my mom for making me food while i was melting my brain on unity)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:22:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b4/0b4666246b5928507fb1e68d9b74eb8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thewildeus", "cocoaniable"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
