Plan is 50+ (Enemy waves are usually between 15 and 25 per level, there are few exceptions) 5 - 15 mins per level<br/>You can choose any of 5 difficulties <br/>Playing on higher difficult will get you to earn more points.<br/>4 Different Types of units(Single Target, Multi target, Aoe and utility)<br/>14 different units can be build(plan 20+). Some are variations and some are more specialized for certain fights.<br/>Each tower can be upgraded 3 to 7 times regardless of their specialization upgrades<br/><br/>Game maps and optimization:<br/>There are 2 maps HighQ and LowQ( you can choose in options -&gt; graphic), you would need to start again from main menu if you decide to change (enemy wave levels are identical)<br/>HighQ is default one and is preferable to play if you have non IGPU(non integrated graphic card)<br/>LowQ is very basic and has box shapes, circles instead of landscape with regular lightning.<br/>Purpose of LowQ map is for PCs with integrated graphic cards or if you prefer higher FPS or prefer simplicity of map.<br/>Lowering details below 4 will change meshes to simpler models(0-10) and below 2 will change them to old fashion static mesh style<br/>You can customize how much forest or flowers you would like in graphic options -&gt; additional options -&gt; beware as those reduce FPS if you apply too much<br/><br/>Skills:<br/>Skills(or talents) are currently being in progress of creating and balancing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74e/74e6170c1d4b6e3d67f2d5cd0f111bb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arc51"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arc51"], "esrb_rating": null}
