It is up to you, the king of all cards, to stop them.</p>\n<p>With your trusty revolver in hand, you prepare for the coming waves of chips. Hopefully, you don't have a Bad Draw.</p>\n<p>Every round, chips will march towards you in 3 lanes.\u00a0Use the number on the dice's heads to determine who you shoot. However be careful, every shot or reload counts as one turn allowing the chips to progressively come closer and closer to you, eventually damaging your health if they are in front of you.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left mouse click: to shoot</p>\n<p>spacebar: to reload</p>\n<p>Powerups:\u00a0</p>\n<p>x2: doubles your damage for that clip</p>\n<p>heart: adds health</p>\n<p>6: makes all bullets into 6 damage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee04524721e4a0f6d654a6d79e22fd31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Skymu"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
