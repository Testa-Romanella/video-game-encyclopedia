Any face-up card can be moved onto another card on the Tableaus if it is in descending order of alternating colors, e.g. 8 of Hearts on a 9 of clubs or Jack of spades on Q of Diamonds.  You can also move multiple cards at a time if they are already in descending order of alternating colors. In addition to using cards from the Tableaus, you can also play cards out of the Stock/Deck.  You can choose (in settings) if you would like to pull 3 cards or 1 card at a time from the Stock. When a Tableau column is completely empty, the available space can be filled with a King. As they become available, cards from Ace to King can be moved from the Stock or the Tableaus to the Foundations.<br/><br/>We are here to help:<br/><br/>---You will learn quickly we promise!
