Use your paws to crawl, jump, and grab to travel around the tree branches and collect the nuts as fast as possible. **This is a VR game that must be sideloaded onto a Meta/Oculus Quest 2 or Quest Pro**.<br/></p>\n<p>-- Physics-based movement system. Move your hands to move your body. Push off of any surface to move in the opposite direction. (Gorilla Tag style movement)<br/></p>\n<p>-- Use the index triggers to grab any surface.</p>\n<p>-- Arrow indicator on watch will point to nearest nut.</p>\n<p>-- Timer starts when first nut is collected and stops on contact with last nut.<br/></p>\n<p>ATTENTION! This is an alpha build. It's a little ugly, has some lighting and collision bugs, and the trampolines are janky, but it is fun to play and I wanted to get this early version out while I optimize art and finish up the final level designs. Hope you enjoy it! Must be sideloaded to headset. Email granitetopgames@gmail dot com with any feedback or issues. Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T07:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54eb3eb29405908ef9399eac789f820d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GraniteTopGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
