But they aren&#39;t after any weapons they want the French Ambassador and his family, who happen to be on board the train. You take the role of Jack Morton, the only surviving member of the train&#39;s crew, as you attempt to protect the Ambassador from the terrorists. You&#39;ll have to travel through more than a dozen train cars, each with multiple levels as you hunt down the evil thugs. Along the way you will also have to solve a variety of puzzles and master three unique mini-games to succeed. When you encounter a terrorist, you can take them out with one of 10 military weapons. For double the terrorist-stopping power, you can also equip a gun in each hand and target two separate enemies at once. Only you can help Morton save Europe and the French Ambassador in COVERT OPS: Nuclear Dawn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d83/d83e61e6f08baeee0ad3c6056468a8ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Sugar & Rockets"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Activision Value Publishing"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
