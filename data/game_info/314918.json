You spend every day pulling in junk and selling it for cash. You have lived a good life, every aspect of which was dictated by the currents of the seas. And then it arrived. A creature the likes of which you had never seen before. You quickly decided to get out of town and never return, but the timing could not have been worse. With an empty bank account, there is no way you can afford to leave. Explore the nearby ocean and use your trusty winch to haul in enough to get out. But be careful, the monster will be here soon.</p>\n<ul><li>Remember, \"treasure\" found further out to sea or deep into the depths will be worth more, so don't play it too safe near the harbor.</li><li>You may spend your hard-earned cash on upgrades, but make sure you don't spend all of it. You need to deposit enough into the bank to get out safely.</li><li>Don't forget to update your light when given the option, it is dark down there.</li><li>Use the patented Claw Cam to grab items too deep for you to see otherwise.</li><li>Watch out for sharks!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f1699b23fec6ede9c9569e198ad920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["A-Flat Miner Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
