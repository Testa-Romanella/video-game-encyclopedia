Boxes that aren't completely in the score area won't count towards your score.\r\n</p>\n<p>You must be fast and efficient since boxes you miss will be deducted from your score! If you let too many boxes go you might be fired! </p>\n<p>When you're ready to finish press the button (using your character) in the top right just outside the score area. This will stop the conveyor belt and end your shift.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c1e63bd5cd5697029ab6a8344b6d8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Monstr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
