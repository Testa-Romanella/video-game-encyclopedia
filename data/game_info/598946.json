Configure your colony around the harsh landscape of Mars, construct your base, and use specialized tools to terraform the planet to your needs.<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Create a viable habitat for your settlers by building water pumps, establishing farms on fertile ground, harnessing the power of the sun, and mining for precious minerals. Don\u2019t forget to conserve your resources to create power cables and pipes that will connect the whole of your settlement!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Use a turn and select a terraforming kit to shape the landscape to your colony\u2019s advantage. Need a water source? Place a water drop tile into a canyon and watch the surrounding flat land become fertile. Need suitable terrain to build wind turbines? Use a terraforming kit to raise mountains that will help increase your energy production. <br/><br/>Terraforming tiles have preset shapes, so be careful when configuring where to place them! You may end up with ice if you place a water drop tile on flat ground instead of a canyon. Be wise in your choices and always plan two steps ahead!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>No two maps are ever the same when you select a new game. With procedural map generation, you will be challenged with every landscape as you navigate the canyons, mountains, and rough terrain of the Red Planet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T14:09:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/943688165074630ceac6a6890a536117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 173, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 453, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Andriy Bychkovskyi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crytivo"], "esrb_rating": null}
