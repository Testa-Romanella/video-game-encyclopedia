Once between people and Varls was hostility, but with the emergence of dredges, they were forced to unite forces, for not being killed by them. At the beginning of the game in the world reigns eternal winter; the gods left all races, and the sun stopped, it would seem, forever.</p>\n<p>The story begins with Ubin, who arrived in the port city Strand for an annual tribute. Upon arrival in the town, he learns that some bandits want to capture the authority. He&#39;s moving to the Town Tall to help the Governor deal with them. Soon, a squad of Prince Vognir and Prince Ludin arrive in the Strand. In the next morning, Ubin joins the team of Vognir, and they are all going in Grofheim</p>\n<p>The player controls a squad of soldiers under the leadership of the hero. In a single-player game, the hero has a story task, which usually requires getting to some point of the game world. On the way to the target, you can occur all sorts of events, and some of them will need the player to make decisions that affect future events.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2014-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T17:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fa3/fa3dd043cba3a9cbfe3085e75d92bf7e.jpg", "website": "http://thebannersaga.com", "rating": 4.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 242, "owned": 2649, "beaten": 483, "toplay": 146, "dropped": 199, "playing": 25}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 198, "ratings_count": 718, "suggestions_count": 514, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 725, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Versus Evil", "Stoic"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Versus Evil", "Stoic"], "esrb_rating": null}
