Mo (the cow) and Sheat (the lady-bug) meet our everyday absurd situations (such as \"pink\" glasses in facebook, traveling abroad and defecation in nature).\u00a0The game currently holds 3 levels. Each one follows a 1-minute-short-animation film telling the story of the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player is Mo and your goal is to get him to his destination. You can also collect objects and kill enemies (jump on their head) in order to get a bonus before proceeding to next level.\u00a0However, hoovering right above you is Sheat. Sheat isn't controlled by any player. He can hardly control himself over his curiosity. This sometimes results in helpful stuff, and sometimes results in another challenge for Mo.</p>\n<p>This was created as a course project. My first Platformer game. \u00a0The 3 levels currently differ in story, objects and destination. However, the level structure is pretty much the same minus some cosmetic changes. Still lots to be done...</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5db/5db3d460f81d97af19746ca6a33765fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mamaMoses"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
