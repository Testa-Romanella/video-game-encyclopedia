I tried to design most things along the theme of \"More is Less\":<br/><br/>For <strong>visuals/mechanics</strong>, the jellyfish is made of thousands of particles with twice as many bonds knitting them all together.\u00a0 However in chain reaction,\u00a0 the 4096 particles become something less, a single jellyfish creature.</p>\n<p>For<strong> sound design</strong>, the cutting sound effect is bubble wrap pops, scissors sliding through paper, water bottle sloshing and white noise all layered and sent through phasers, tape delays &amp; low pass filters. The sound is made of many parts but all together becomes something less.<br/></p>\r\nSee a playthrough\r\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Thanks to <strong>guillegoky13</strong> for testing on Windows</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0d4c960bbf2809f30c882aa5fd14d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AystarGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
