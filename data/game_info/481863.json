And you, the player, is tasked to take care of one witch and train her Magick so she can vanquish the hellish creatures that plague their land. But be careful, for if you do not manage to maintain her stats and you make her lose a battle, she will succumb to an untimely, and\u00a0<strong>permanent\u00a0</strong>death.<br/><br/>But fear not, for a new witch will take over her place, with some of the former witch's stats gained.<br/>===========================================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CORE FEATURES\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Witch Raising</strong>:\u00a0The\u00a0main objective of this game is to 1) take care of a witch, 2) increase her Magick stat while maintaining the other stats, and 3) defeat enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Interactions</strong>: Manage her stats using the following commands: Brew, Rest, Enchant, Cast, Bless, Stamina, Hex, and Talk.<br/><br/><strong>Battle</strong>: Fight other enemies without the use of any complicated battling system. All you have to do is to measure each other's Magick stat, and whoever has the higher stat percentage wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Permadeath</strong>: The witch will permanently die if you try to battle a boss when she\u2019s not 1) trained enough and/or 2) in a bad mood.<br/><br/><strong>Reincarnation</strong>: Don\u2019t fear though, because once the current witch dies, a new one takes her place.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Transfer</strong>: The stats of the departed witch will carry over to the new one, and depending on the level of Affection, can range from a miniscule 5% or a whopping 50%.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Time</strong>: The game is currently divided into 30 days, with each day ending if the witch's Stamina drops to 0 or you choose to Bless her. Make good use of your time. You can also only challenge a <strong>boss</strong> once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping</strong>: You can buy stuff for the witch to keep her entertained and well-fed from the shop. <strong>Currency</strong> will only drop from defeating enemies.</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T06:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc4ddbe61f59399592dc966c92d22fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avarisia", "chiecola", "JCNep", "alistairjunnich", "jaycastle", "ProdiG"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
