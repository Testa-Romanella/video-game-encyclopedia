This work is largely influenced by I WANT TO DIE SCREAMING UNCLEAR by Chang and Voge 2020. Main goal in this project was to perpetuate chaos and panic. This is achieved with both music and obviously also dialect. Additionally the bomb design is purposefully confusingly simple and weird.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/2802874ca3100875a4a58a36d649c38a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KonstantinLackner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
