Lost on an island, head out and uncover the mysterious infinity st.. erm, gems. Each contains a mysterious power lost to the world (seriously, I didnt get around to implementing the magical upgrades bit). Unlocking all of these gems is the endgame. But as with anything, time (ie your lifespan) is against you (a kind of currency?), so dont take forever!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:10:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0010407481f97ac12a5715bb7999bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex_ADEdge"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
