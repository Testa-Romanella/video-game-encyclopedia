{"id": 25544, "slug": "wordmaster", "name": "Wordmaster", "name_original": "Wordmaster", "description": "<strong>WordMaster</strong> is a simple word making game. A round lasts 1 minute with 7 randomly selected letters (with at least a single vowel among them). You score points by creating long words or by using letters that are used less frequently in English. You may repeat letters within a word. The trailer shows exactly what the game is and takes you through a full round, post game, and leaderboard update. <br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>Suppose our round letters are W I N E R S L. We could spell wines, winners, sewers, sinners etc. <br/><br/>Here is a breakdown of the scoring:<br/>Letter points:<br/>AEIOULNSTR = 1 pt<br/>DG = 2 pts<br/>BCMP = 3 pts<br/>FHVWY = 4 pts<br/>K = 5 pts<br/>JX = 8 pts<br/>QZ = 10 pts<br/><br/>Word length:<br/>3 letters = 1 pt<br/>4 letters = 2 pts<br/>5 letters = 3 pts<br/>6 letters = 5 pts<br/>7 letters = 8 pts<br/>8 or more letters = 10 pts<br/><br/>This is my first attempt at coding. I'm a teacher and wanted something my students could play that would be somewhat educational.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T04:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a52bd8f28a84b3570c6e136d8d34aa9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Joseph Hoff"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zoo Games", "Hoff Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
