Unfortunately, the crystal was stolen, so she has to venture out and retrieve it first. She will give it her all to get that crystal back and fulfill her duty. It was a promise, after all...</p>\n<p>Dragon Hearts: A Daughter's Promise is a short (1-2 hours) rpg featuring a linear story and turn based battles in which you use various skills to defeat your enemies. There is not much in the way of unique features, except for the minor wrinkle that you will be running with a party of one for the majority of the game.\u00a0The game is not intended to be difficult, but be careful: game overs <em>will </em>happen if you overextend and run out of MP at a bad time.</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\u00a0<br/><strong>Isacaiah</strong>\n<p>A 12 year old girl, and the protagonist of the story. Despite her age, she has an incredibly strong sense of responsibility, and is not very keen on asking others to help fix her own problems.</p>\n<br/><strong>Gondroch</strong><br/>\n<p>The antagonist who has stolen the crystal. He is a bit of a nut case and has illusions of grandeur, but his magic is the real deal and that makes him a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<br/><strong>Moonlight &amp; Infinity</strong><br/>\n<p>A pair of masked travellers that Isacaiah meets on her journey. Where they are from and what they are doing is a mystery, but they seem all to eager to involve themselves in Isacaiah's situation.</p>\r\nSome more words\r\n<p>This game was made in RPG Maker MV over the span of ~4 weeks\u00a0and released for the Release Something Event (RSE) that coincided with the 31st birthday of the RPG Maker series. I really enjoyed making (and actually completing!)\u00a0this game, so I hope that you guys will get some enjoyment out of playing my game as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The plan is that this will be the first in a series of games featuring characters and stories from all over the world of Aethera and beyond, but I admit that that is still very far away. For now, please enjoy this game!</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Flaming Chicken Sword Lord<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/18276fac7846b9bfc6bbcb3d12bd1177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flame Chicken Sword Lord"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
