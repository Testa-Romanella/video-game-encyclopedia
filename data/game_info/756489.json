As his pufferfish pal Dennis, you need to puff yourself up and stop the attackers.</p>\n<p>Each time you puff yourself up you can defeat one enemy by touching them.\u00a0\u00a0You can puff yourself up multiple times (up to 3 puff-charges), and each time you hit an enemy you lose one puff-charge.</p>\n<p>But watch out! If you touch an enemy without being puffed up you lose a life!</p>\n<p>Horace has a health meter at the bottom of the screen.\u00a0 Different types of enemy cause different amounts of damage and are worth different point values.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Horace's health reaches zero or you run out of lives, it's game over.<br/></p>\n<p>Remember: STAY PUFFED UP!</p>\n<p>Note: This game takes place in a universe where near-misses count as hits because I don't know how to do sprite collisions properly yet.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Coral by LiQWYD | https://soundcloud.com/liqwyd/</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>--------</p><p>Sprites:<br/></p><p>Puffer fish icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p><p>Shark icons created by Flat Icons - Flaticon</p><p>Coral icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p><p>Whale icons created by Good Ware - Flaticon</p><p>Jellyfish icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p><p>Harpoon icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:55:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13bf4177ce3f65fb0fcf14dbaa75a056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ajh1138"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
