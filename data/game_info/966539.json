During her search, she happens upon a magical portal that lures her into Everholm: a cute, cozy little island where everyone seems to recognize her. Gathering her wits, she sets out to uncover the mysteries of this little slice of heaven, with the help of a local witch...\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverholm is an open-ended role playing game, focusing less on punching your way through the island's wildlife, and more on interpersonal relationships.

Lilly will have to learn how to farm crops, forage for supplies, do some fishing, raise livestock, and more. Turn a little run-down homestead into a cozy and well-kept place to truly call home.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Everholm isn't all sunshine and flowers - the island has many secrets which need to be pried open by force or finesse accordingly. Delve into procedurally generated dungeons to fight monsters that lurk underground, requiring powerful weapons and spells to survive. Delve deep enough into the dangerous caverns, and Lilly might just be rewarded with rare materials to bring topside\u2026\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is always more to Everholm than meets the eye. As Lilly bonds with others, discover each of their hidden secrets. But before that, they need to trust Lilly, which may be more difficult for some over others. Help others or choose to ignore them and enjoy the cozy atmosphere and non-linear story as you prefer!
