It's a story about how he grew up with his grandparents due to unloving and distant parents. It's a story about how he grew up without meaning. It's a story about how he grew from his experiences and became a better man so that he could be the best father for his kids.</p>\n<p>It's a story about strength. A story about hope. A story about love.</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -</p>\n<p>This was a very emotional game for me. I've always loved my father and seen him as a jolly old man, but as I grew older and learned more about his past, I became aware that how he grew up was very different than how I grew up. He would tell me all these stories about how his parents abandoned him and treated him coldly, and yet not once did he ever lose confidence in himself. He stayed positive throughout his whole life, choosing to take his past experiences and use them to mold himself into who he wanted to be. My dad has always been my shining light when I face my darkest moments, so I wanted to dedicate this project to him.<br/></p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -<br/></p>\n<p>This was an assignment for UCSC's CRWN 86 Fall 2018 course.
