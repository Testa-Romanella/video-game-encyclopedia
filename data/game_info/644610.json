In the video, she showed this game she had invented, to quickly get rid of the unpleasant feelings that happen when she cannot stream.</p>\n<p>Do not confuse with a certain other game with falling blocks that also ends in \"tris\".<br/></p>\n<p>Developed in 2 days, so expect a bunch of funny bugs. :)</p>\n<p>The blocks will stop falling while rotated horizontally. That's not a bug, it's intended as it happened like that in the original video.<br/></p>\n<p>Try the Windows version if you have trouble running the Web version!<br/></p>\n\r\nOrigin video (Starts at 4:59:00)\r\n\r\n<p>Or watch the clip I made of the game part:<br/></p>\n<p>https://youtube.com/clip/Ugz63YwXhvPD3-vBkxx4AaABCQ</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This free game is a derivative work of Cover  Corp.'s Hololive property.
