It is to test a few ideas out, but is ultimately as an idea for an interactive feature. This app will take users through an interactive experience, where they have to follow a story and learn some facts about space and technology we have as a result of research and technology. This was just a concept, and therefore there may be some bugs or issues that will need ironing out, however this is only my second real project using Unity.</p>\n<p>Visuals were by Weronika Koscien</p>\n<p>Coding and building was by Bradley Edwards (myself)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e69d408bbb5773179a78fee9927126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bradderz15"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
