There is no doubt that you have been kidnapped. The speaker introduces himself as 'The Gamemaster', and you to play a game of wits. If you should make it out of the crypts within two hours, you will win a cash prize of $10 million. However, if you should fail, you will lose your life. You will need to solve puzzles and collect items before the time runs out in order to win. Perhaps you will also be able to figure out who 'The Gamemaster' really is, and why you of all people got chosen for the dubious honor of taking part in this game?<br/><br/><strong>Beware: </strong>Though this may all seem easy, you can never underestimate just how twisted 'The Gamemaster' can be.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li> Over 80 Rooms<br/></li><li> Engaging Interactive Fiction Story<br/></li><li> Lots of Inventive Puzzles<br/></li><li> Dark Atmosphere</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:32:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/438/438f93b28b60196bc6c8de2799e73953.jpg", "website": "https://www.shohogames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shoho Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Shoho Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
