In 2013 Bob Henderson (USA) uncovered some\u00a0fascinating\u00a0unique tours on small \u00a0grids. This game offers \u00a0a taster of these results. The three\u00a0tutorial levels will teach you everything you need to know, while the five main puzzles ramp up very quickly to a level of difficulty that may prove surprising. Do not feel compelled to finish them! Note: you may find the puzzles easier to solver as print-and-play puzzles.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Number of puzzles:\u00a0</strong>8\r\n</li><li><strong>Average play time:</strong>\u00a0longer than your patience</li><li><strong>First published:</strong>\u00a0 June 2022 (exclusive to itch.io)</li><li><strong>Keyboard controls:</strong>\u00a0arrow keys or WASD to move;\u00a0[Z] to undo; [R] for restart.</li><li><strong>Touchscreen controls:\u00a0</strong>tap at the main menu; swipe to move;\u00a0open the tab menu in the upper left to undo moves and restart.</li><li><strong>Hack:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0source-code</li></ul>\n<p><strong>SS-tour research\u00a0- </strong>Bob Henderson - 2013<br/><strong>Puzzlescript implementation\u00a0-</strong>\u00a0Andrea Gilbert - 2022<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57226181a7d1677c08f8563d7afeb17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clickmazes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
