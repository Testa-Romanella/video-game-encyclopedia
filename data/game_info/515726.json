If you see something that's wrong in this mod and you want me to fix it, I can fix anything (not referencing Fix-it-Felix Jr from Wreck\u00a0It Ralph)! If you're saying to yourself \"Why is the intro The Addams Family 1992 intro? That is not related to Animaniacs.\" Basically that was stuck in my head and I\u00a0needed to get it out of my head so I put it in just to catch you off guard (\u00a0I mean that metaphorically just to clarify). I promise in the next update for this mod I will include Yakko's\u00a0World because that's a song that fits Yakko and fits Baldi's original plan besides math.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/900c2934c68c625168dbe1179b5afe33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheMarioManGuy"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
