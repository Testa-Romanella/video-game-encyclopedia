Don't like your Blunks stolen? Create a Fenda to block and reflect shots back.

I wanted to attempt to make a different spin on the typical click and watch style of idle games. Once I got started I wondered how far I could actually take this concept. I'd love to spend more time on this, but I really would like feedback before I continue forward.</p><p>Notes<br/>Agro fires shots only if friendly units are not in front of, or directly behind.<br/></p><p>Fenda will reflect shots if the damage of the shot is less than the Fenda's defence</p><p>The Wizard appears every 60 seconds unless it has been in combat. It then has an unsaid resting period before it comes back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/5491a344faad989c6489ad41e0744256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrTroy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
