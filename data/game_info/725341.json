You can also regain ammo by killing enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enemies come in different sizes, big chunky bois are slow but tanky, smol speedy bois are fast and die easily.</p>\n<p>This is just the first release and I'm planning on adding more weapons, upgrades, different types of enemies, power ups and much more. <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and good luck!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c51e05f9709aab6bb0e3a770de53dc30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LOLYDERP"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
