You start each mission by piloting the brand new V-22 Osprey and picking locations to drop three ammo crates deep in enemy territory (Airborne Ranger was released in 1988, the Osprey first came into active service in 1989, so this is some real black ops business). Each supply crate contains ammunition, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on your briefing. Choose locations wisely: you can only carry so much ammo, so resupply is critical.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen parachute behind enemy lines and get to work. .. and this is no easy drop, you will need to steer your parafoil to a safe landing. Missions range from destroying military targets and  sabotaging installations, to rescuing POWs and stealing secrets. You\u2019ll need to navigate enemy troops and officers, minefields, foxholes and bunkers. Switch between stealth and surgically accurate combat to succeed. At times you might even need to steal an enemy uniform. And you better get back to the LZ for exfil in time, or you will get captured. If you get captured, welcome to your next mission \u2013 you are going to need to mount a rescue attempt before you can complete the primary objective. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnderstanding the environment is critical to success. In the arctic missions you can lure enemies onto unstable ice, in the jungles and forests you can hide under water. Do you use your knife? Your M4? Or a delayed time bomb? Sprint across the open field, or crawl in a trench to avoid detection? It is all up to you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPractice mode lets you try individual missions, and then step up to Veteran mode and you will have to complete all 12 missions as a campaign. You\u2019ll rank up with each successful mission, all the way to a full colonel in the U.S. Airborne Rangers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTwelve missions, winter, desert and jungle terrains, and four difficulty modes will keep you playing again and again. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA mix of strategy and arcade action <br/>\r\nAn accurate 80s menu of weapons<br/>\r\nChoose from your squadron of Rangers for every mission<br/>\r\n12 timed missions<br/>\r\nRandomly generated maps for endless replay<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAirborne Ranger was lauded upon release for a number of reasons. Compute Magazine called it \u201can  excellent game from beginning to end,\u201d and warned \"the violence and action are graphic and highly realistic.\u201d  Computer Gaming World praised the level of detail after they noticed that gunfire sounded differently if you are inside a building vs outside. Retro enthusiasts have called it a \u201cstealth shooter\u201d and a pioneer of the genre.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/4442541dd5060893102f0fbe4b7328d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Atari", "MicroProse"], "esrb_rating": null}
