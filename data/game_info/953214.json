In the game, players assume the role of an expert parkour runners who must make their way through a city area that is full of structures, alleyways, and other hazards.</p>\n<p>Players will need to execute a variety of parkour techniques, such as wall running, leaping, sliding, and vaulting, in order to advance through the game's stages. A strong physics engine will also be included in the game, simulating realistic movement and enabling players to chain together challenging actions to travel across the terrain.</p>\n<p>The overall objective of this project is to develop a parkour game that is gratifying and demanding, with rich and intuitive gameplay. I think that this kind of game has the ability to hold players' attention for lengthy periods of time, and I'm eager to realize my vision through this endeavor.</p>\n<p>How to Play\u00a0</p>\r\nActionControlRun\r\nHold W Key\r\nSlide\r\nPress LShift Key\r\nPerform Parkour\r\nPress SPACE Key\r\nLook Around\r\nMove Mouse\r\nFight\r\nLeft Mouse Button", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2f068fcd6397d7867f6d9561fa3391c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kshitij Srivastava"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
