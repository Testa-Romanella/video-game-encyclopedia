I utilized space throughout my Bisty game, connecting the environmental aspects with the plot, revealing thoughts or dialogue a child might have when going to school and forgetting a mask. There is the usage of shuffle and conditional dialog. Shuffle shows children's quick, random thoughts and conditional for different conversational aspects between parents, teachers, and siblings. The atmosphere helps a player transform into a child's perspective. I want to add a better, longer ending dialogue, but the rest of the rooms are coherent for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T17:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc088b82de56ad2489a2803b2cc57ad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pjmsmoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
