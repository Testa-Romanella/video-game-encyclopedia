Sorry about that. We'll update this after the #cgajam is over and get everything working again.</p>\n<p>More details soon. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1e17b46fe067f9de300a0d2c5da9f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prime Function: Holt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
