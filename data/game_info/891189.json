Videos too, intro video, and one other are not there, just black screen. Reason for this and few more things I missed is that I got married during this jam. And it wasn't planned. So I had jam to organize my wedding during this jam. It kind of\u00a0loops, and\u00a0it is kind of special jam for me, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0I lost 15 days for that, but somehow managed to deliver a \"game\". It has few cliches, and\u00a0it has many refferences to other games, so if you find some, please comment</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T17:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af9562f1c435657e5021eda3bebd9d6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["goks1986"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
