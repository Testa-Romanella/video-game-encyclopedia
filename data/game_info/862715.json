Then the stars were born with a new star emerging every cycle. The stars grow in energy every cycle until they move to destruction, returning to the darkness. When the stars grow out of control and the horrid starlight covers all, this universe itself will be destroyed and return to darkness.\r\n</p>\n<p>The galaxy ship Stardark is charged with draining energy from the stars to keep the universe in balance.
