I'm just thinking stuff up as I go along.</p>\n<p>Once I figure out a nice way of creating early access releases I might put some up for people to test and report bugs with. Once the game is completed and I'm happy with it I intend to put it on Steam (and Itch ofcourse) with a minor cost. I'm not hoping to get rich, I just want to make a game and publish it on known platforms so that I can have it in my resum\u00e9.</p>\n<p>The game will in paralell to the Steam release remain open source. So if you can and want to compile it yourself you are welcome to do that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97c/97ccf1e3d9e61649a9d4855546f8fc7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiquidityC"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
