This game is a top-down zombie survival game that incorporates a hard-hitting storyline, weapon crafting, resource management and scavenging. This short prototype was created within Clickteam Fusion and is an admirable outcome of my first attempt at using the software. The assets were taken and modified from The Spriters Resource.
