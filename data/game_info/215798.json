Get out! Deflector is a frantic, challenging, 8-bit retro style, ball bouncing,\u00a0arcade game full of sweet 80s music and explosions.<br/></p>\n<p>Deflector comes with the complete project setup and all source code for you to poke around in. Paying for the game is optional. Any money I make on Deflector goes towards further development. You can see what I plan to work on in the stretch goals below.</p>\n\n\n\r\nBe ready to:\r\n<ul><li>Create explosive chain reactions</li><li>Dodge burning table tennis balls</li><li>Score millions of points. Because millions are a thousand times better than thousands!</li><li>Play four different hand drawn levels</li><li>Explore four different game modes</li><li>Challenge yourself in a few levels of difficulty</li><li>Escape through doors</li></ul>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>Smash table tennis balls with the X key</li><li>Move around with the arrow keys</li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nStretch goals\r\n<p>If I make a few dollars on the game, I\u2019ll add new features and improve existing ones. Here\u2019s what I want to do when I reach\u2026</p>\r\n$10Replace the custom pixel art camera with Unity\u2019s new pixel art camera. Publish a WebGL build, here at itch$15Add local highscore list$20Add support for PS4 and XB1 game controllers<br/>$40Local multiplayer$80Rewrite the game loop to not rely on the ScriptableObject events. Make the event flow easier to understand, and use ScriptableObject events for non-critical events, like playing audio and such$100Rewrite collision handling and projectile movement to use the new job system for parallelization$125Rewrite the projectiles to use the new Entity Component System\r\n<p>The readme file will be kept updated to reflect the new improvements and features. I\u2019ll document as much as I think is necessary for you to read in order to understand the code. If something\u2019s unclear, let me know and I\u2019ll elaborate where necessary.</p>\n\r\nNewsletter\r\n<p>Sign up for my newsletter at\u00a0http://eepurl.com/dEmUin\u00a0to get occasional emails on subjects like:</p>\n<ul><li>Updates on Deflector.
