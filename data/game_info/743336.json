This is a partial conversion of the town mechanics from the PC-8801 game Nausicaa Adventure Game from N-88 BASIC to Twine language. It may be too wide for the itch window in some browsers, so be sure to full-screen it to play in that event. This will be re-incorporated into a larger project, but for now I figure it's a solid proof of concept of something I haven't seen pulled off in Twine language before. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T11:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc30dbff5e491eca7edb6cf742bf873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
