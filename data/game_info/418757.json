And on days like these, people like you should be cooming as well.<br/><br/>But when you think your safe, your butt is suddenly invaded by grey tentacles! Oh why did this happen today?!<br/><br/>Go out on an adventure and meet interesting characters whom you'll only pick based on sex appeal and not their stats. Collect valuable items to aid your quest. And discover over 300+ monster girls, monster-boys and inbetweens in combat! Mayhaps after all that hard fighting they'll want to blow off some steam with you in CG cut scenes.</p>\n<p> But beware, not everything the world of Restoration is all about sex. Fearsome monsters from the prequel METEORRPG will appear to ruin your day with their cunning tactics and sheer power. To complete your journey, you must master both your combat skills and charisma to defeat the monsters!<br/><br/>(game in development, not all features listed are included)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf44fe24b451fbd808a1d71df85f007e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Zyuese"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
