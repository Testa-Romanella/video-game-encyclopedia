We are a student project developed by a team of 4 game design students at UCF. Our main goal was to emulate the classic Atari experience of Commando while adding new twists on the bullet hell genre. I hope you enjoy our game and look forward to its full release. </p><p>As of December 6th, the game is currently released and right here on the page! It might be updated in the future to include any more ideas that might be better for it, but that all depends on if there's time and if people like it. How many hits can you get through the game with? </p><p>As one of the creators of the game my current record is only 1 hit. I challenge anyone to beat or match it. //AD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c3042b5e8c7e2b4119df67fdb5a0e728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GioStar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
