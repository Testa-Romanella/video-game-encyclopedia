Defeat enemy ships and collect scrap from them to upgrade your ship with more blasters, better armor, the ability to launch bombs, and more, but watch the temperature gauge on your weapons or it'll overheat on you. Fight your way through four sectors to face the evil lord himself, but even if you can defeat him, you might find things aren't quite what they seem before reaching one of three endings. Can you figure out how to get the secret one?<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck and thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or W/S: Move</p>\n<p>Space or Left Click: Fire</p>\n<p>B or Right Click: Launch Bomb</p>\n<p>P: Pause Game</p>\n<p>Some controllers should work as well.
