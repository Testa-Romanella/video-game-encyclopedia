It's a tiny world of two realms against each other for eternity. Creaea vs. Aillai. Aillai vs. Creaea. You can choose a realm to help win over the other. <br/><br/>In an amazingly tiny but detailed battlefield, you can not do so much control thingy so. Since your champion and his troopers have their own minds, they will do whatever they feel right to do like any child or pet. And their simple minds of not so much high standard from your point of view might make you feel some frustration at first.<br/><br/>BUT! at the moment of the frustration, Thank God!!! You will find your tiny mighty champion can feel the direct existence of you and interact. So from then, you can pick the champ with your fingers to hold high in the air safe from harm's way or to move into a different spot, activate his/ her skills.\u200b\u200b\u200b And also you can do mighty tiny miracles like creating a stairway out of thin air guiding your champ and troopers to overcome a high ground or obstacle, creating a wall to block opponents or your team with your own will and also giving opponents your pounding firm fist. And much more miracles to be with you.<br/>\u200b<br/>As for the troopers... well, never mind. You just need to assemble them well right before entering the brawl. They can only feel you in a veeerrryy distant way. So it's the only way that you pick them well that suit your champ and your miracles or the other way around. That's it.<br/><br/>And it's enough now.<br/><br/>So hurry to join and feel the tinyverse at your fingertips at a shop 'MINImax' that I feel pretty sure you are the curious kind of person into the tiny world.<br/><br/>The Realms of Tinyverse await you for such a long time.Tiny is Mighty!<br/>from the shopkeeper of MINImax<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u200b\u200b", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-10T08:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26a60ac50159473996bfff151a42ea42.jpg", "website": "https://minimax.game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 183, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 489, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["O'olBlue", "oolblue"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["O'olBlue"], "esrb_rating": null}
