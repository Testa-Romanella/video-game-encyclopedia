Utilizing VR would provide the ultimate player experience and create the level of awe and wonder we seek to instill in our players/users.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game may also serve as a host for a \u201cMetaverse\u201d in which we will facilitate the displaying, viewing and advertisement of NFT projects, with custom spaces provided and the ability for artist to share their work to be showcased in our various virtual Art Galleries.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The ultimate aim for this game is to achieve all fore mentioned aspects in a visually enthralling manner with support for multiplayer group experiences much like a group tour in real world.\r\n</p>\n<p>This prototype was created during a 48 hour Game Jam hosted by Animation SA and sponsored by Adanian Labs.<br/></p>\n<p>Developed by: Vedanth Panchoo, Jayaveer Harilal, Nkanyezi Thabethe, Thapelo Moima and Fuzo Magudulela.</p>\n<p>Music: Song for Denise (Maxi Version) - we do not own the song, just thought it would be fun track to use.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd47503b9f0384ce347c498000a2502.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["V Master", "thapelo", "ARTOFYEZ", "JayHarilal"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
