As you venture further and further down you sacrifice your blood to keep going. You regain your blood by slashing apart enemies, with your heart-stopper sword and your sharp blue disc projectile. The heart-stopper sword gets stronger, larger, and more devastating the more health you have. It only gets weirder the lower the depth, do you have what it takes to reach the bottom battling the abominations of the underground. <br/></p>\n<p>Abominations might include a 25-year-old man from Ohio suffering from pink eye.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b842ff8495cf6b993ab42f33d6b95e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrayonMelon", "BEEF(Jack)", "Oscail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
