In the default mode (Challenge), the number of lemurs will increase with each wave. Be sure to watch out for their variety of attacks and quick reflexes. After a wave is complete, choose a skill to add to your inventory. These skills change the properties of any attack and can stack endlessly. Make any attack as overpowered as you like and create your own playstyle from the skill you choose. The Test mode (available from the pause menu) gives you all of the skills from the first wave and only one lemur will spawn endlessly.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Currently only controller capable.\u00a0</strong></em>Only Xbox 360 controller tested.

It's obviously not finished but I feel it's at a point where feedback would be super helpful. The next update will prioritize sound effects, two-player co-op, more skills focused on the attack animation speed, and bug fixes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T11:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b82b56faf5e3096c817853825b247b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PechaLute"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
