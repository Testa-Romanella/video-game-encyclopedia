This lead to apathy, and apathy led to obedience. But what happens when the clues to truth begin arising on their own? What happens when the house of cards begins toppling down, drawing everyone along with it? It is upon you to decide whether you will go down the rabbit hole, and how deep you can push through.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nP9: The GateAway is a noir visual novel taking place in a dark world plagued by a mysterious mental disorder which had affected over 80% of the population. The disorder had caused bouts of erratic behaviour among the Citizens, including an increasing rate of strange, identical hallucinations. Its cause unknown, the City authorities had issued a special type of pills\u2014the P9\u2014designed to numb all primal instincts and urges.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe pills were a success, but that only led to new problems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThose who did not exhibit the symptoms found themselves living bland, pointless lives among a sea of mindless drones. As they sought to find the truth behind it all, they soon discovered that in this world even truth had layers. They were as much prisoners of the City as others were of their own minds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a Citizen thrust into this dark sprawl of intrigue, it is upon you to try and reveal the deepest truth of all\u2014the meaning of existence itself.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c59c3ce287231303635842d189f15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Killer Bees Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Killer Bees Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
