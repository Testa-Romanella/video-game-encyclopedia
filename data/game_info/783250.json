Open DOSBox\r\n</p>\n<p>2. type `mount c ./` to mount the current folder\r\n</p>\n<p>3. type `c:` to go to that folder\r\n</p>\n<p>4. type `slimer` to run the game\r\n</p>\n<p>If that doesn't work here are some\u00a0instructions about getting DOSBox working on Mac\r\n</p>\r\nOn other\u00a0Modern\u00a0Computers:\r\n<p>The process should be similar as on Mac but possibly\u00a0you can drag the game into the DOSBox window or onto the icon\u00a0and it will work right away. \u00a0That didnt work for me but if not\u00a0here\u00a0are some more\u00a0instructions about getting DOSBox working on Windows\r\n</p>\r\nOn Old Computers:\r\n<p>Or for the adventurous and enterprising MS-DOS users out there this should run in any version of DOS on ancient computers\u00a0even as far back as 286's and before. \u00a0 \u00a0I haven't and cant test it on an old machine but let me know what you find out. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T11:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe3a21db0fcdb6cf4339a841b836d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fab Dynamic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
