{"id": 537462, "slug": "not-another-kitty-platformer", "name": "Not Another Kitty Platformer", "name_original": "Not Another Kitty Platformer", "description": "<p>Set in an oversized bedroom, play a kitty trying to leave the bedroom. Toby the gluttonous cat has blocked the exit and will only let you leave for 3 of his favorite treats, fish biscuits. Collect the biscuits by exploring the bedroom, keep an eye out for hidden collectibles. Play for time and see how fast you can beat the level!</p>\n<p>Author's Note:<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first \"complete\" game I have made. It was fun to finally finish a game since I was notoriously stopping because of scope issues. A lot of future plans were cut to counter that issue. If you need some inspiration, take this game and make it better, I will be flattered I could inspire your next project. All feedback and criticism is welcomed and encouraged.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/451adc78747c462510b3bdb4eb7db12a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["benlloyd50"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
