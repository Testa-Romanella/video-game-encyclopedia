It was the first Jam ever I participated in, and this is what I came up with.</p><p>In Pewdie Mania, you will be faced with a random challange every turn. If you don't manage to complete the challange, you will lose 1/3 lives. If you are out of lives, you die. Pretty simple.</p><p>When you complete a challange, you will advance to the next stage. The game will get progressively harder as you climb up the levels. Try to reach level 100!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2d3114963a447eaa74187b731f6c16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wowelite"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
