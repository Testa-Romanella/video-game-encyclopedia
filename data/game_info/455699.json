I like to channel my irritation and eye rolling into parody content.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Deadpool used to love patrolling the streets with New York\u2019s friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, but lately things have been a little awkward between them. One day, Spider-Man finally talks to Deadpool about what\u2019s been bothering him.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Whiny Spidey (creative title, I know) is basically a visual novel based on an old story of mine. I like making parodies of stupid tropes and patterns that I observe in stories.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Original Story: https://archiveofourown.org/works/24671101\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game has a couple of different endings and one kind of easter egg thing. Each ending is sort of like its own parallel universe.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a full game, not a demo, alpha, beta etc...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T02:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/9433d1c3c052a8b5046384f95ab71863.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glitch--Gamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
