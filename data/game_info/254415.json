It mainly consists of free assets from a unity tutorial. Other teams have put far more creative effort into their projects.</strong><br/>At the moment the game is still almost identical to the one offered in the asset store for free by Unity to help follow along with their 2D Roguelike tutorial. I tried to use the remaining time to individualize the game assets and to make something more original and Rocketbeans-related out of it but didn't have enough time on my own.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>: You are a travelling\u00a0polka musician with a caravan of carnies. Your troupe arrives on the murky outskirts of New Orleans. Now you have to travel through the eerie swamps of the bayou\u00a0to reach your final destination, looming\u00a0gloomy in the distance. Can you escape the dangers of the swamp unscathed? Or will you\u00a0succumb to the blues?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>: Fight against the cruel RNG gods of yesteryear and survive Permadeaths constant\u00a0vicious attemts on claiming your hard-earned ever\u00a0waning stash of rare eternal soul-stuff... like... in <em>that</em><em> other game</em>. And all the stuff is randomly generated, for added replayability and\u00a0more fun, the same way\u00a0as in all those\u00a0oldschool rouge-likes you so much enjoyed\u00a0 when you were young. When playing as an @ was still hip and training your little <em>d</em> to steal precious loot from those greedy\u00a0shopkeepers for you was the bees knees\u00a0(<em>Who's a good boy? Yes, you are! Yes! You! Are! Have this newt corpse as a treat... Yes! You git gud, Boy</em>!).\u00a0Alas, nethack your way through hordes of bean-flavored foes and\u00a0discover the true meaning of\u00a0the blues.\u00a0Completely captivating and hightly\u00a0interactive, thanks to the innovative and\u00a0slick state-of-the-art touch controls that your android device provides these days. And the highly original and\u00a0captivating blues-and-polka-infused\u00a0soundtrack extravaganza produced exclusively for this game by the hottest and most bestest public domain musicians I could find... Will. Rock. Your. World.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overwiew</strong>: I will be\u00a0Following some simple\u00a0Unity tutorials, testing the 2D features of Unity (since I haven't been using Unity for some time) while working with the included\u00a0prototyping sprites from the tutorial available from the\u00a0Unity asset store.\u00a0Then I will try to switch them out\u00a0along the way\u00a0with some handmade\u00a0pixel\u00a0art and\u00a0sprites inspired by\u00a0the\u00a0Rocketbeans TV guys in Aseprite. I'll add some story screens\u00a0working in\u00a0the two required themes selected for this game: <strong>Blues and\u00a0</strong><strong>Jahrmarkt</strong><strong>.</strong>\u00a0Then I'll add some custom sound effects and try to\u00a0find a few polka-and-blues-inspired\u00a0songs to complement the atmosphere of the story. In the end this will\u00a0hopefully produce a 2D android rogue-like gane apk before the 48 hour\u00a0timer hits zero. Finally, I'll try to document the necessary steps and all the\u00a0progress done.\u00a0Hopefully this'll show others how\u00a0making games is fun and how this all\u00a0can easily\u00a0be be done\u00a0by anyone if they just try.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>polkamundo! by a.gorilly (c) copyright 2010 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license.\u00a0http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/lillygorilly/29027\u00a0Ft: herkko, pingnews, Bitcrusher, illusivemind</li><li>The Zombie Sings composed by C.P.Bryan provided by freesoundtrackmusic.com</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Scripts</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>ViewportHandler.cs, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2014, Marcel C\u0103\u015fvan</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools and\u00a0Ressources</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Title and initial\u00a0idea\u00a0created using the awesome video game name generator:\u00a0https://videogamena.me/.</li><li>Pixel art will be done using the fantastic pixel art graphic editor Aseprite:\u00a0https://www.aseprite.org/\u00a0*</li><li>Some of the graphics (like the screenshots for this page) will be done using the free paint tool\u00a0paint.NET:\u00a0https://www.getpaint.net/</li><li>Prototyping, game development and the final programming\u00a0will be done using the free personal edition of\u00a0Unity 3D:\u00a0https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal</li><li>The code for the game\u00a0in C# will be written using the fast, lightweight and versatile editor Sublime Text 3:\u00a0https://www.sublimetext.com/3\u00a0*\u00b2</li><li>The basics for the game are outlined in the\u00a0following tutorial:\u00a0https://unity3d.com/de/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial</li><li>The prototyping assets for this tutorial are taken from the tutorials accompanying free asset pack\u00a0in the unity asset store:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/2d-roguelike-29825<br/>(these will later be replaced by my own handmade sprites)</li><li>Mobile touch input implemented following the basic instructions\u00a0in these unity mobile\u00a0tutorials:\u00a0https://unity3d.com/de/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/multi-touch-input?pla...</li><li>Testing the game on android and building the final\u00a0apk was done following the\u00a0instructions in\u00a0this unity tutorial:\u00a0https://unity3d.com/de/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-g...</li><li>Version control, all the used assets of the game,\u00a0the complete project code and all the unity project files are available for download in this public github repository of the project: https://github.com/ndbiller/beansjam_mobile\u00a0*\u00b3</li></ul>\n<p>*\u00a0Aseprite\u00a0is not for free but you can always download the source code directly from their github repository and compile it on your computer for free, if you know how to do that.</p>\n<p>*\u00b2 Sublime Text 3 isn't\u00a0free, but you can use this text editor without limitations.\u00a0It will occasionally remind you while saving\u00a0that you should buy a licence if you enjoy working with it.</p>\n<p>*\u00b3 You really should be using some kind of version control system like github.</p>\n<p><strong>TODO</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>set up android debugging</li><li>fix android game resolution<br/>(should at least work for nokia 7 plus (in landscape mode) or similar devices\u00a0with a resolution of\u00a0<strong>1080 by 2160 pixels</strong>\u00a0at a PPI of\u00a0<strong>403 pixels per inch</strong>)</li><li>title screen</li><li>story screen / instructions</li><li>credits screen</li><li>create custom sprites</li><li>return to title screen from game over state</li><li>add more music and fade between tracks - <em>nice to have</em></li><li>make enemies mortal - <em>nice to have</em></li><li>more enemy variety and weapon pickups\u00a0- <em>nice to have</em></li><li>different level biome tiles - <em>nice to have</em></li><li>implement different level biomes - <em>nice to have</em></li><li>story progression on biome change\u00a0- <em>nice to have</em></li><li>add an awesome boss battle\u00a0- <em>nice to have</em></li><li>have a win state\u00a0- <em>nice to have</em></li><li>ASCII level sprites (player as @, Zombies as Z, etc.) as easteregg - <em>nice to have</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p>\n<p>Set up your development environment before the game jam starts.
