So I decided to attempt to code the entire thing on a plane flight, and I managed to get the basic framework of it done, and I had to finish all of the other features, and complete it later.</p>\n<p>The premise of the game is to unblock the toilets before they are broken, more toilets are constantly added (until the maximum 144 toilets is reached), and a random amount of toilets are blocked every few seconds. You have a limited supply of \u201cgolden plungers\u201d which can fix toilets, and when all of the toilets are broken, you lose.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T04:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aab2b9aece62d451e6bf5819f714eb77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["VONSANDWICHFACE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
