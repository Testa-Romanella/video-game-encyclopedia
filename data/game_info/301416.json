Stories that can be utterly gut-wrenching or panic ridden and yet operators keep calm and professional, all for the sake of helping the person on the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to test out the core\u00a0experience of being on the receiving end of an emergency call and the search engine mechanic, where you need to listen closely for clues on what questions to ask the caller to best assist them.</p>\n<p>If you like what you played or have any feedback at all, please reach out!
