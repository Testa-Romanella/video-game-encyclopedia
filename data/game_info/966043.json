Using carefully crafted camera systems, The Inner Demons allows players to watch the character through a perspective that cuts and seamlessly transitions between cinematic camera angles and movement while still allowing the player to retain full control. The game uses an unusual room-relative movement system, so travel is not interrupted when the camera cuts. In The Inner Demons, players control Ilia, a girl who wakes up to find that her house is not as she remembers. To survive, she must traverse shadow-filled rooms and escape the watch of powerful shadow-makers. Explore a unique horror game through a cinematic lens in this innovative interactive experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T04:40:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b59a2174b6987125f6077f63e2f1708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Batyaggy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BatYaggy"], "esrb_rating": null}
