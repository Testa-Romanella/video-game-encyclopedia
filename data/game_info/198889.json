I made this (probably a game) with my friends, did lots of mistakes and had lots of fun in progress. I used not very appropriate technology for my game, I used CraftyJS for canvas stuff (learned in the process) and Semantic UI for UI. I think its much easier to use Unity, UE or any feature-rich editor not just a little js-lib. Anyway, what do we have here:\r\n- Theme \"The more you have, the worse it is\"\r\n- Game about NOT picking up bad habits\r\n- Strange rock/metal music (checkout grindcore stuff in dying screen)\r\n- Strange sprites and color scheme\r\n- Strange embedding on itchio (my mistake)\r\n- Strange spaghetti code made by myself, you can check it out too.\r\n- Strange item spawn system (just random), so there are lots of situation where you can't avoid a \"bonus\".\r\n- There are some bugs tho, probably will fix them and probably will fix the whole game (:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1eb387dee5d384911cf4b41b57c41c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["w96k"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
