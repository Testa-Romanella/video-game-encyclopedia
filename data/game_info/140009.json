A WIP but it's playable now, and feedback is greatly appreciated.</p><p>My first game shared with the world, too, which is a big deal. Go easy on it!<br/></p><p><strong>Why?<br/></strong></p><p>I was sad to see the state of cross-stitching apps and games: every one seems to be an over-monetised colour-in-the-pixels game that tells you when you're wrong and gives you bonus coins once a week. This game aims to be closer to the actual, slow act of stitching and to be decidedly noncompetitive.<br/></p>\n<p>Saying that, if you think it could do with some more gameification then ideas are very welcome.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>There's a basic tutorial in-game (click the ? button). Space zooms the camera, WASD pan it. You can finish a thread and choose a new colour by clicking the tick or pressing F / middle mouse button. Undo a stitch with the undo button, U key or right mouse button. There isn't much more to it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06ea9a9911f99fff18e9dbd54ba902e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["unwttng"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
