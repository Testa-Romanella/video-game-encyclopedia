Your own clan occupies the northeast part of the forest.</p>\n<p>Your clan enjoys peaceful relations with the Clodhops and the Celtannachs but the Turdrocks have become antagonistic towards all the other clans in recent years, as they want more land to expand into.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, a warband of Turdish dwarves were repulsed after they encroached into your lands, but they captured some of your warriors. Your clan has tried to rescue them on two occasions but failed each time with many casualties.</p>\n<p>You suggest to your clanchief that one dwarf might succeed where many have failed and bravely volunteer to attempt a rescue of your clanmates.</p>\n<p>So you leave Wild Otter village next morning and head south towards the lands of the Turdrock clan, the shouts of encouragement from your clan echoing in your ears.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992176b7f4aa8f96370d2ebce7cf26be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazzah"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
