Traverse forests, deserts, and the Halls of Illusion; jump over hedgehogs, hitch a ride on a turtle, and evade vicious snakes - all for the reward of more cheese than you could ever eat, and what more could a mouse want?</p><p>The game was made for a charity fundraiser that raised over $4000. It won two OROW awards and was runner-up for four AGS awards. As befits a platformer, it has hidden objects to collect, unlockable game modes, and the vicious Moby Duck as boss monster!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362fd11f3321ee8c52dfcb03450421d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
