But with a \"twist\" - the gamefield could be extended in the 3rd dimension by the depth slider on startup. With a wider field the flip (F) control is used to \"more easily see the field\"(2 units depth is the recommended for enjoyable play).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T12:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d46f4d2618d7e7d334bbe0da4cf1a834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kexana"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
