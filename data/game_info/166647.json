Finally they can exterminate much of the preys and thus damage their own food base. The process can finally come to some steady balance, or to convergent or divergent fluctuations, depending on different parameters.</p>\n<p>Grazing of herbivores is another\u00a0essential process in our wildlife modeling. \u00a0As the density of animals increased, vegetation begins to dwindle. Finally, it becomes impossible to feed the population, which leads to its reduction.<br/></p>\n<p>Work is in progress, we need your feedback about the concept and any ideas!</p>\n<p>Feel free to visit our facebook page:<br/>https://www.facebook.com/Wildl...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8aba0ba1888bf92834ab1622716d9ed1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GTS"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
