Besides what better way to get your mind of something\u00a0then a little bit of comedy, right?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Behold! Community Infection which is a single player based simulation chaos game. The goal is to limit/eradicate the disease of this community town square, and all the people that live there just do <strong>NOT</strong> take care of themselves. New members get welcomed to the community, so priorities might change over time. A lot of people, and a lot of disease do not mix well together wouldn't you say?\u00a0\u00a0You as the player,\u00a0 you need to help them by cleaning and sanitizing infected areas, give medication to help save lives, and give face masks out to those who are infected to stop the spread of the symptoms. Where would we be without the comedy, so you use a bottle of \"Germ Away\" and a Mop (On Grass and Brick!) to clean the infected areas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The simulation AI actually can heal themselves over time, however there is a minimal chance they can do it alone with the increasing disease rate. What are you waiting for?? Jump in and help that poor community and laugh at the hilarious AI, animations, and by products from the viruses!</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy your experience, there are things we wish we could have added, but we both work 8am - 5pm jobs (So Monday is a no go).\u00a0 So we had to work with the time we had.\u00a0I look forward to hearing what you all think of our crazy, comedy twist on this jam theme!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:55:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9cf2a699d8e24cb8d838454da4e7f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LongBrotherStudios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
