He could throw arrows. Why didn't he use a bow? That is lost to legend.\u00a0 Nonetheless, one day the village got invaded by goblins! They built many Lairs inside the village limits. They needed a hero, and Arrow Knight stepped up.\u00a0Can you save the community?</p>\n<p>Move with Wasd or Arrow Keys. Click in a location to throw an arrow in that direction.\u00a0There are 25 lairs and one stronghold. The stronghold is invincible until you destroy all the lairs.\u00a0 Lairs have 10 health each! If you get hit by a goblin, you retreat to the community center and lose a live. As you defeat goblins and plow your way to the stronghold, people will gradually come back to the community. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Coding: Me</p>\n<p>Music: Me</p>\n<p>Art: Me\u00a0</p>\n<p>Concept: Me</p>\n\n<p>Made for the Design Buddies Community GameJam!</p>\n<p>This was my very first game ever!</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/2805ce077e19ccf4f5b6293752b1c125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Da Great Mup"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
