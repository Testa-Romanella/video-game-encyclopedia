It features 36 unique elements, including water, slime, quicksand, and more!</p>\n<p>I made this project so I could get accustomed to the LOVE2D framework. Admittedly, many parts of the game are not well programmed, but hopefully this shouldn't impact performance too much. I plan on making a sequel in the future with better optimization and organization, so suggestions would be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>LMB - Place particle<br/>MMB - Copy particle<br/>RMB - Delete particle<br/>SPACE - Pause<br/>R - Reset Playfield<br/>Q - Layer View (Debug)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Socials:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Website:<br/>https://sites.google.com/view/retrocitycenter/home</p>\n<p>YouTube Channel:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/kingtut-101</p>\n\n<p><strong>Licenses:</strong></p>\n<p>LOVE2D:<br/>https://love2d.org/wiki/License</p>\n<p>Classic Module:<br/>https://github.com/rxi/classic/blob/master/LICENSE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed90beed0ff1947b7550b1b89d82663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KINGTUT 10101"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
