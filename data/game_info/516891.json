My solution was to create an infinite runner game about driving a car across country with the radio on. The radio plays music with a continuity announcer and between songs, the ads on the radio station are real ads.</p>\n\n<p>The game will later be expanded to include phone calls from various family members, allowing a branching narrative to be told through the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/696b8ae0ec4607d24dbbdbe7d56e86bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["igd"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
