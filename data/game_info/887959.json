This idea evolved a little bit beyond that, and we have given each character more than just being a gamer. That said, <strong>THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED</strong>. \u00a0If you played the demo you may have noticed its in black and white. This wasn't a stylistic choice, I merely don't have enough pocket change to pay artists. I got the artwork we currently have from a friend who gave an enormous discount.\u00a0<br/><br/>Trailer:<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:40:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435b3646b6adf000f5b841918863f20b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cool kyle888"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
