You have to run around collecting 8 yellow balls (click them) that can only be seen when you are close enough to them. There are lots of red dots that can't normally be seen. You can press e to see them for a short amount of time, but this has a cooldown. Please tell me honestly if this would fit into a horror game. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c94cbb14fe79234458bcc5a12f7865c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mr_strange_man"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
