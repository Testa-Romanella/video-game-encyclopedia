{"id": 710810, "slug": "death-life", "name": "Death & Life", "name_original": "Death & Life", "description": "<p>Death &amp; Life is a\u00a0short, philosophical exploration game (mix between walking sim and visual novel) that rewards exploration (with funny comments and story bits) but does not require it to grasp the main story. You incarnate Tommy, a person who's found himself lost in a familiar place, under extreme circumstances. Join him on the path towards reconnecting with himself and moving on.</p>\n<p>Submission for the Senscape Adventurous Jam 2021, I made this project in little over a week. This was my first experience making any game, and in particular, my first experience with Unreal Engine 4. I've really put my heart into it, and I will continue to develop it in the near future, to try to get it a little closer to my original vision (and learn a little bit more of UE4).</p>\n<p>Planned stuff I will add in the future:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Voice acting\u00a0</p>\n<p>- More sound effects</p>\n<p>- Various cutscenes to enhance certain moments in the game.</p>\n<p>- Some secrets, and perhaps an alternate ending</p>\n<p>- Correct some interactions that can become overwhelming in certain places.</p>\n<p>I welcome and am really grateful for any and all criticisms and comments that can help me on the way to becoming a great developer someday.\u00a0 Please, bear in mind, this is a rough first attempt :).</p>\n<p>A bit about me: I'm from Argentina, I love adventure, exploration and puzzles games; I play piano a bit (and hope to be able to add my own score to this game someday), and also sing a little. I work\u00a0as a physicist, currently in the process of completing my PhD in cognitive neuroscience. I'm also into Kung Fu (Northern Shaolin and Tai Chi). I (clearly) believe having diverse interests and hobbies is a great way to stay balanced and enjoy life :P.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing! I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dda25af5a4ad1efbf06e55a5a0205c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fredling"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
