The intense immersive coaster ride feels so real you may feel dizzy or nauseous, Enjoy! <br/><br/>Hints from testers:<br/><br/>- Try putting the screen right next to your nose, and cross your eyes a little until you see one blurry display, then while retaining focus on that image, slowly move the display away until you reach about 12 inches. The optimal distance is dependent on you eyes and ability to focus. When correct, the center display should be clear. <br/><br/>- Another method is to hold the display about 12 inches from your eyes, and hold your hand perpendicular to your display about half way between your eyes and the display. Move your hand closer or farther from the display until with each eye closed you only see one of the images. Then when both eyes are open, you should find it easier to focus within the display. Once you have focused on the display, you should be able to remove your hand. <br/><br/>- In general, you need to relax your eyes and focus within the display in order to see the effects.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T05:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e69a4a2400238563a6eabc709a946f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Snow Storm Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["SLY Industries"], "esrb_rating": null}
