It has automatically spawned enemies and you control FOUR mushrooms that shoot the closest enemy to them. You can click on them with the centre of your screen and then move the shroom you clicked with WASD. Correctly positioning them to reduce enemy damage is the challenge of the game. I also made a tutorial for it, but it does not seem to work very well. You're welcome to try it though.</p>\n<p>This was made in Unity 3D and I took some models from TF3DM. If you think I took your model and you would like me to either change it or give credit, e-mail me on asado@me.com.</p>\n<p>Source code for sale.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79f9077845cdd34292ae9bc49846604f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Asado"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
