{"id": 482364, "slug": "a-city-at-dusk", "name": "A City at Dusk", "name_original": "A City at Dusk", "description": "<p><strong>A City at Dusk</strong> is a game of searching, history and wonder. Become a travelling seeker of the arcane: walk the halls of a fallen kingdom; commune with spirits in secret groves; hold a lantern to the faded stone, and piece together the tale of a lightless land forgotten by time.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay is split between the Map screen and text-based story events. As you travel the game world and resolve events you\u2019ll acquire items, artefacts, stories and knowledge; all of which can be used to unlock further events and opportunities. Other factors such as the passage of time and choices made previously will also affect options available to you.</p>\n<p>The game's systems are largely complete; my focus is now on writing and implementing content, and adding polish such as audio and visual scripting. God only knows when I'll be done.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bdab4afea02815186f5c4b7dffbf0975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lain White"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
