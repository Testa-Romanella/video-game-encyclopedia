Puzzle and item placement dynamically shift, so each playthrough is slightly different. The game's event system randomly places jump scares based on the player's progression. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game has been built with as little menu interaction as possible.  All inventory items are stored directly on the player's item belt, or held in the player character's hand. There are no in-game menu interactions (except for the map menu for player convenience). All discoverable notes are held directly in the player character's hand. While exploring environments and inspecting items, the player character will vocalize a description.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Experience many evolving enemy varieties:</strong><br/><br/>The \"Stigmatized\" are zombie-like enemies. Damaging \"Stigmatized\" with conventional weaponry can put them in a temporary dormant state, but eventually, they will reactive and mutate depending on the damage dealt to them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The hive of \"Fractal\" enemies are a constantly evolving chain of worm-like organisms. If not dealt with properly, these enemies can spread, transform, and multiply.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The mysterious entity some have referred to in folklore as the \"Fleshgait\". This unpredictable enemy cannot be killed and contains many surprises for players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Evolving pathlines:</strong><br/><br/>Depending on the player's story pathline many different side characters can be encountered. These character interactions can completely alter the potential endings of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The fate of NPC encounters is decided by the player's decisions and actions.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T07:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7cac866419f9267e5d2e62f906c657f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["So It Appears"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["So It Appears"], "esrb_rating": null}
