Once you have found all memory shards you are free to leave the world again and search for the next mind you want to explore.<br />\nTherefore every single imagination world acts as its own small story with its very own theme, design elements, and obstacles.<br />\nExperience the feeling of flying, immerse into beautiful and atmospheric landscapes and enjoy the unique storytelling of the game while getting to know a lot of interesting people on the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T02:50:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60ac36ca1b95bb3c550742009e668d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 475, "game_series_count": 15, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
