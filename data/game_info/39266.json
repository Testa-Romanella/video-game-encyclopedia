But there is still one among the citizenry who is determined to exorcise the evil that has robbed the town of its former glory. He has pledged to both take back the streets from the gangs, as well as dole out equal justice of his own design upon the white-collar criminals who continue to bleed the city dry. He is vice cop Jack Slate. Betrayed and hunted by the organization he once served, he wages war on a daily basis, armed only with a gun, his bare hands and his intimidating canine, Shadow. Together the two of them make their way through the underbelly of the city, only to uncover a shocking conspiracy that threatens to shake the world to its core.</p>", "metacritic": 60, "released": "2010-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-07T22:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b8/0b87551cc63524ca971a131578acb31e.jpg", "website": "http://www.deadtorights.com", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 50, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Volatile Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
