It's got a few bugs and pieces of text missing, but that won't be seen in my future games, or at least not if I can help it. It was my first game and I kinda rushed it, so it's not as polished as it should be. The story's okay, but I could've done better by extending the game and making the story longer, or by adding no additional story.</p>\n\n<p>[Easter Eggs]</p>\n<p>[Another Creepypasta]: When you encounter the lone gravestone, hit the \"yes\" option to see a guest appearance by another creepypasta. It will give you a game over, but the reference is still nice.</p>\n\n<p>[Bugs/Glitches]</p>\n<p>[Ghost Tiles]: Though it's more of a mistake than a glitch, there is one room with tiles that can be walked through.</p>\n<p>[Petrified By A Puzzle]: This one is the bane of my existence. If you push a block all the way to a hole, wall, or the edge of the screen and push it again, the block won't be able to go any further and you'll end up getting stuck in the process. I won't let that happen in any of my future projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f0677fa89eb18477ff03bca8d7ab7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devilion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
