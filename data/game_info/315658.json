This depends on who ultimately ends up doing the art and whether the 2D art works to clearly convey the game.<br/></p>\n<p>The narrative content\u00a0is a small part of what will be a much larger story, so it is naturally\u00a0missing some of the context. Basically, there's some major stage setting before you even get to the Western Wood, like what the mechanism is and why you need it. All of that will, of course, be in the full game.<br/><br/>You can read more about the missing context in the dev log, if you're curious. My aim was\u00a0that the prototype should be\u00a0fun and representative of the game's mechanics, but not requiring a huge amount of exposition. However much you decide to read up in the dev logs\u00a0or just play the prototype, thanks for checking it out!</p>\r\nPrototype Controls\r\n<ul><li>Left and right arrows/A and D:\u00a0move the player</li><li>Up arrow/W:\u00a0look up</li><li>Spacebar: interact\u00a0(talk, search, etc.)</li><li>Escape: open or close the letter (basically pause the game)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba8/ba83bb94a02736096e6f1c0cb12fc800.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["epiblitikos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
