You can follow the directions of the narrator, and get a proper story... or, you can throw it completely off track and change the nature of the narrative entirely. Our team recreated two of the mod's six endings, re-recorded the dialogue,\u00a0and made simplistic versions of various Source engine objects in Autodesk Maya. We hope that you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Created by Adam Goren, Lianna Pang, and James Yuan.</p>\n<p>For Robert Yang's Intermediate Game Development class, fall 2019.</p>\n<p>Music used with permission from Immediate Music.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Yoav Goren.
