It is the year 1452 and a city under siege is desperate.  You receive a letter, bearing the king\u2019s seal, begging for your help.  A once beautiful, peaceful place is now a tormentor\u2019s paradise; dark, bleak and heavy with fear.  <br/><br/>You venture along the road to your destination, determined to solve the mystery terrorizing the citizens of Istanbul.  Thousands of bodies line the roads, impaled on bloody poles, ravaged &amp; torn, lying limp; faces contorted in anguish.  If this is just the path to the city, what lies within its walls?  <br/><br/>A gruesome scene welcomes you; hollow sockets live where eyes once saw their murderer coming for them.  Torsos of young children ripped open, their bodies hung like criminals; blood filled pools in the Cistern house rotting bodies, throats cut, fingers missing.  Dank Catacombs lined with broken bones containing new members, heads daggered, burn marks over eyes.  Blood streaked Basilica walls, disembowelments and beheadings.  The brutality is too much to bear. What \u2013 or who -is murdering the innocent lives of these people!?  You hunt through the night, intent on finding your foe, bringing an end to the grisly massacre. <br/><br/>As the Explorer, you have knowledge of the land; you are fast, on target and adventurous.  You leave no stone unturned in your pursuit. Will you be the enemy Spy or will you be the Emissary?  <br/><br/>The Mage is skilled, wise and supernatural.  Become the the high Priest who can be counted on to cast spells to protect the people of Istanbul or choose to be the Sorcerer and release your inner demon fueling your thirst for destruction.<br/><br/>The Soldier; fierce, strong, and none better with a blade.  Protecting people is your Knightly duty, with your feminine intuition &amp; compassionate heart leading you to do the right thing for the kingdom.  But perhaps you would rather seek to unlock the dark side and become the Assassin.  The choice is yours; will you seek justice or wickedness?<br/><br/>Each character unlocks unique levels and secret weapons.  Feel the weight of your decisions and change the story of your game with each turn.  Your actions will determine the future of your people, saving their souls or surrendering them to evil.About the Developers<br/>Section Studios brings you this action packed adventure, where your wits are just as important as your strength.
