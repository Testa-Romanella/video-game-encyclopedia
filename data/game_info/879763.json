This project could become a possible future game and is also the first game I have ever released. I was expiramenting with a new way to make art but since I did not have an actual style, it was hard to make art assets for the game (ie the supply boxes and UI do not match the rest of the game).\u00a0I got bored of working on this project but if people actually find this itch.io page and want me to continue working on this game, I think that my interest will be restored. Thank you to anybody who downloaded this game, ily &lt;3</p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD - move</p><p>Left Mouse Button - shoot</p><p>Switch Gun - 1 is pistol, 2 is uzi</p><p>Reload - r</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T05:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bb3a247317050bf6945bcd2fdb7e527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZAG"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
