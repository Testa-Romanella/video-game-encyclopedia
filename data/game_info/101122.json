In FEED, swimming together means winning together. </p>\n<p>The game is best enjoyed with six players and six controllers. Each team takes control of an amoeba-like aquatic organism made of three characters in a race to out-feed their respective FISH ELDERS. Players can choose from one of three characters: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The STUNNER, whose ability can knock out friends and foes. </p></li>\n<li><p>The DASHER, who can get a burst of speed in any direction.</p></li>\n<li><p>The ANCHOR, who can become invulnerable and immovable. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three ways to feed the Elders:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bring the Urchin (the big ball) back to your Elder\u2019s mouth. Make sure to bring the Urchin back to the Elder of your team\u2019s color.</li>\n<li>Point the Clam at your base for a steady stream of points.</li>\n<li>Collect the fish using the center of your team\u2019s three-limbed creature and bring the fish back to your base. Your center can hold a maximum of 10 fish.</li>\n</ol>\r\nPlatform\r\n<p>PC, Mac</p>\r\nDeveloper/Company Name\r\n<p>Fish Elders</p>\r\nTeam Credits\r\n<p>Paolo Salcedo<br/>\r\nTimothy Sun<br/>\r\nHang Ruan<br/>\r\nVivi Yu<br/>\r\nHosni Auji<br/>\r\nLaurenz Riklin</p>\r\nSocial Media\r\n<p>https://twitter.com/fishelders</p>\r\nCountry\r\n<p>United States</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/528/52849a8a5e65c514df2759f316ea4839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fishelders", "tim", "paosalcedo", "hosoji", "turist", "RuanHang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
