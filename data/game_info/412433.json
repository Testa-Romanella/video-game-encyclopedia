Your duties are to go to meetings, replying to emails, not punching Bob from hitting \u201cReply All\u201d, you know, the usual office stuff. The job is not perfect, but you have to pay the bills, if only your boss would give you a bit more space.

New challenges come up every day, can you manage to finish your 2 day trial and earn enough money to pay rent?</p>\n<p>This was my first ever Ludum Dare game jam\u00a0and I really enjoyed it.
