Instead of killing all monsters, you had to find the exit to the next section.</p>\n<p><strong>Diabolical Nightmare 3</strong>\u00a0started back in 2011, right after I had released the second game. However, due to a hard drive failure, the game was lost. A year later I decided to start the game again using GZDoom, but hadn't really touched until 2017.</p>\n<p>DN3 is currently a demo that lasts around 15 minutes, at some point you'll run into a dead end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93b9e017e13e4ace56086f73ee4f8880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logic Obscure Productions"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
