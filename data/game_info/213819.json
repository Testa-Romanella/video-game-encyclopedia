My work-in-progress SVG-importing library\u00a0FaXe\u00a0came to rescue in the last minute, so I could put together quite fancy GUI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f81b6550a82923157806c59d8b0371f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarnik"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
