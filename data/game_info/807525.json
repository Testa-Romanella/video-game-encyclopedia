As the experience evolves, your actions start merging with the virtual surroundings, making the interaction more challenging.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A project about Daydreaming</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is based on research about Daydreaming. Daydreaming is a state of the mind that immerses the daydreamer into fictional scenarios.\u00a0 Daydreamers achieve this state by repeating daily tasks that do not ask too much of their attention.\u00a0 The daydreams are replayed over and over as the time passes by (sometimes even for years) by the daydreamer.\u00a0 They often put themselves into these states to experience situations that are unlikely to happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Will your attention follow?</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T11:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5ab7330a8ebdd527ee414b0de1c133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ohhh_Alex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
