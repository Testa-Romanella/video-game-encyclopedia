This is a 2 player multiplayer game.\u00a0The game is divided into three phases.</p>\n<p>Phase 1: You go around the map and place clones. In this phase, you spawn on the opponent's side of the map.\u00a0The game also tracks and records your movements in this phase and your movements become a clone itself in the later phases</p>\n<p>Phase 2: You get to go around the map and look for your opponent's clones which you have to defend. In this phase, you spawn on your side of the map.</p>\n<p>Phase 3: You get to go around the map and kill your own clones and defend your opponent's clones.\u00a0In this phase, you spawn on your side of the map.</p><p>You get a point whenever you kill your own clown and when you kill the opponent. Each player takes 5 shots to kill. When you die, you respawn back at your original spawn location.</p>\r\nGame setup:\r\n<p>If you have two players, great! There are <strong>two\u00a0</strong>ways to play.\u00a0<strong>For both ways to play the game, you should be on the same network.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A) </strong><strong>Manually connecting between server and clients (probably have to do for CMU network)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Note: Anything that is \u201c.exe\u201d could be different for Mac. Substitute \"server.exe\" and \"client.exe\" with whatever\u00a0is called \u201cserver\u201d and \u201cclient\u201d in the downloaded zip.</p>\n<ol><li>Have one player run the server with \"server.exe &lt;host ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;\" where &lt;port&gt; is a custom port number\u00a0\r\n</li><li>You can find your host ip by typing command ifconfig and using the ip in en0, or through other ways\r\n</li><li>Have both players connect by running \"client.exe &lt;host ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;\" where &lt;port&gt; is the same custom port number used in step 1 and &lt;host&gt; is the IP address found in step 2\r\n</li><li>For an external client to connect, the client may need to turn off his/her firewall \u00a0(If you see something like trying\u2026 but it does not fail, you should try this)</li></ol>\n<p><strong>B) </strong><strong>Using LAN connect. </strong>(If you are the only two people on the same network playing the game) (Buggy)\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Start up the server on one person with \"server.exe\"\r\n</li><li>Have both players connect by running \"client.exe\"\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Both players should automatically find the server, connect and start playing!\r\n</li><li>Automatically display the client\u2019s ip address\r\n</li></ol>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong>: WASD</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Shoot/Place clones:</strong>\u00a0left click</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/203ab1f4d62a1f3995009a02fb03f893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["patrickhuang112"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
