This will cost energy. But if the dolphin finds some fish to eat, she will replenish. Be careful not to get stuck between a rock and the left screenbound for this will cost a life. The same happens, if the dolphin gets stranded on a garbagepatch.</p>\n<p>The pufferfish will sting and the jellyfish will shock. But drifting ghostnets and radioactive particles cause way more damage.</p>\n<p>As dolphins are extremely intelligent mammals, the player is able to catch keys with her nose and open up chests that were lost by animal traffickers. This will free little turtles that seem defenceless but might prove otherwise in the final battle. This also applies to the octopus entangled in plastic bags.</p>\n<p>At the end of your journey, you will face a natural enemy who will try to eat you. Try to evade or hurt the enemy by jumping him. But ration your attacks wisely for they will damage you as well.</p>\n<p>Good Luck! And let me know if you find any bugs, enjoyed playing it or have an idea how to improve the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The game contains many assets that were created by various artists.
