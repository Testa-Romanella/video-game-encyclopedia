{"id": 376564, "slug": "escape-from-the-wolf-castle", "name": "Escape from the Wolf Castle", "name_original": "Escape from the Wolf Castle", "description": "<p>Escape from the Wolf Castle was created for Ludum Dare 21. </p>\n<p><strong>Original description for Ludum Dare 21:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>My game is about a rabbit trapped in a sort of castle full of wolves. I originally planned it to be more complex, with having the wolves chase you around, finding other rabbits and some other things. If it weren't for the 12-hour extension, this game would have a really small test room instead of a proper level and no sounds, so THANK YOU WEBSITE CRASH!</p>\n<p>The game is sort of a dungeon crawler. It should really have more levels, but it was hard enough to make a single one and I don't have any more time. You run through a maze, find things blocking your path, and find things to unblock your path. The game's biggest feature is the turn-based fighting system I managed to put together, which I think is pretty cool for a 48-hour game. It's also pretty fun. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>\n<p>In response to the comments, the game did always feature a rabbit. I didn't really think about it, the only time it seemed weird was when I was making the bow-holding sprite, but even then it still seemed strangely natural.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/20056a3321ac7b6b5b3e1a646803ada6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petzi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
