Unlike any other existing VR girls on Steam, she is totally customizable and has an AI soul: 1) Players can customize actions for Miss Sakura. We have a library of more than 200 daily actions and 60 sets of dance actions for Players to set combinations; 2) Players can customize the clothes for Miss Sakura; 3) Players can customize own voice dialogues/interactions for Miss Sakura, for example, if you say 'I love you' to her through a microphone, she will blow kisses excitedly and express her joy; and players can make own interactions too. 4) Miss Sakura can understand some of the player's voice, and respond accordingly. During the game, Miss Sakura's favorability of the player will change, and she will have different behavior according to her favorability; 5) Players can choose a video from their computer (a single dance is recommended), then our AI will extract the action and give it to Miss Sakura.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, we are constantly improving the demand functions for Miss Sakura. Miss Sakura now can drink water when she is thirsty, in certain scenes (not all), and could be excited to play with dinosaurs on the Dinosaur Island scene. There will be more demand functions in future of course.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the current version, there are 5 interactive scenes to play. They are: 1. DIY ROOM, which is the main scene; 2. A pretty club, dancing and carnival scenes; 3. Dinosaur Island, the world of beauty and dinosaurs; 4. A sakura park; 5. A luxury villa for two people.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T02:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91121979edc8a75455ab4bd6b637d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William at Oxford"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["William at Oxford"], "esrb_rating": null}
