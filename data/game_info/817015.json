I developed it in a little under three weeks with no prior experience so it's pretty bare bones. Feel free to play and let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>Sidequest Link: https://sidequestvr.com/app/9756/rhythm-fire</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T10:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2c0e508f5062cd0b88a8e0f42cb370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kehtehsky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
