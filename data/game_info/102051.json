Maybe a problem, but hey, the other guys here are hot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Resort des Monstres is a resort-themed gay monster dating sim, with a cast of 4 monster boys to choose from. It's a simple visual novel format made with Ren'py, created by two gays\u00a0who find the lack of good gay visual novels disappointing.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is in demo, and we hope to have the game finished and up by the end of the summer. Keep updated, find out more about the boys, and ask questions at our tumblr, @resortdesmonstres, or at our twitter, @gaygentstudios ! If you like what you see, consider\u00a0giving us a ko-fi?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d109c734483f69707a737cba0d64de68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GAYGENT STUDIOS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
