At its core, the game was derived from a simulator where everything is interactively tied together. You will have to setup and maintain the equipment that supplies pressure and a breathable atmosphere to the base. You are also tasked with growing food, setting up communications and extracting resources in order to make the base self-sufficient. The game offers three zones, each with their unique challenges. There are 7 phases to each mission. Each of the phases expands the base and offers a new set of orders for you to complete. You advance through the ranks as you score points for your performance.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/76048723a18510c2cca6092b8713441c.jpg", "website": "http://www.hyperkat.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 11}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HyperKat Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HyperKat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
