I originally released it on the Google Play Store, where it went completely unnoticed....</p>\n<p>DUNGEON is built around one concept: Choices. During a run, you will encounter enemies, traps, wizards, and treasure, at which point you will have a single choice: Do you fight, or do you run? You'll have to decide which encounters to engage, where you can fight and level up your stats, or escape from, to recharge your health, in a careful balancing act of HP vs XP. After 30 floors, you'll encounter the boss, who can't be beaten by mere cowards! Your actions in a run will determine which ending you will receive, and each ending will reveal a new page in the story of DUNGEON!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you just want to play, without all that careful balance and story, try out Endless mode, where you must climb the Infinite Tower and defeat the Dark Lord on every 20 floors!</p>\n<p>With 4 character classes and over 15 endings to discover, I hope DUNGEON will provide some entertainment to you all!</p><p>******Keyboard Controls*******</p><p>Escape - Exit Game</p><p>1-5 - Change screen size</p><p>0 - Toggle fullscreen</p><p>Everything else is done through the mouse!<br/></p>\n<p> <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d77efae2cf4db9cbcbee12c2360efd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["The Dopplegamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
