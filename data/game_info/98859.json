Their mission is quite simple: <em>they have to walk all the way through point B and finish the game.</em> This is all they need to know.</p>\n<p>Outside of the game context, The Linear Game is a fun little practice project I developed while working on my other bigger project, <strong>.defrag</strong>. The bulk of the game can be finished in <em>less than 10 minutes</em>, if you exclude any potential side activities.</p>\n<p>The available build does not contain RPG Maker's trademark Runtime Package (RTP) and the good news is you won't need it. :D\r\n<strong>Just extract the archive, click on the executable and have fun!</strong></p>\n<p>Special thanks to:<br/><strong>Pancaek</strong>, <em>for drawing the backgrounds, sharing feedback and playtesting</em><br/><strong>Uorriz, Geo, Nothy, Joke, psy_wombats, RaithSeinar, Allen, Dario Zubovi</strong><strong>\u0107</strong>, <em>for playtesting and QA'ing<br/><br/></em><strong>SPOILER:</strong> <em>This game also contains a deliberate hidden tribute/reference to Mortis Ghost's <strong>OFF</strong>.
