The basic idea is a survival game where you have to hunt for food, in the future\u00a0build a base where you can garden, keep animals, etc. Additionally, you will need to arm yourself because various creatures will attack your base.</p>\n<p>I am very grateful for any suggestions you share in the comment section.<br/><br/><strong>Some systems are already complete that are not included in the currently published demo version, but I need to do some optimization before new version. So I would be grateful if you could describe the specifications you used to try it out.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T07:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f826f717b6ee0850bd0e0ea419c318f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kamucifer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
