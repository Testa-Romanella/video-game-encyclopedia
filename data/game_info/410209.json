Theme was \"Death is good\".</p>\n<p>This is a short puzzle game where dying is required to advance to the next level. When you die a grave spawns in that location. The grave can then be used to jump over obstacles or press buttons. If you managed to get yourself stuck, no worries. All levels in which it is very likely that you can get stuck have a little trash can that you can touch to remove all your graves.</p>\n<p>You can use the on screen buttons if you're on a mobile device or you can use the following buttons on your keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>W: Jump</li><li>A: Move left</li><li>D: Move right</li></ul>\n<p>It's made using the Scrapy game engine that I created myself. If anyone is interested it's open source on GitHub and available on npm:<br/>https://github.com/Kam1ni/scrapy-engine<br/>https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrapy-engine<br/></p>\n<p>The source code of the game itself will also be available here once the submission period for the jam ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f735c3484983aa7c09ca5df841ecf5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kamil Kulach"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
