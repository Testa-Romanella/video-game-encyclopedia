{"id": 54286, "slug": "nba-jam-1994", "name": "NBA Jam (1994)", "name_original": "NBA Jam (1994)", "description": "<p>NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game published and developed by Midway in 1993. It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The project leader for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.<br />\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.<br />\nThe release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge) and baseball (MLB Slugfest).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/133e3095f02c80776aba906b0efc7460.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 24, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Game Gear", "SNES", "SEGA CD", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Midway Games", "Iguana"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Midway Games", "Midway", "Acclaim"], "esrb_rating": null}
