Yes you heard me right, this time I spent more than 2 days on the game and it actually works properly. WDM2 like it's older version turns your Desktop into a\u00a0battlefield of cursors! Slash and blast your enemies away and achieve victory!</p>\n<br/>\n\r\nBattles\r\n\n\n<p>As soon as the game finds you a\u00a0match, your desktop wallpaper will change to a randomly selected arena, a music will accompany, your opponents cursor will appear on your screen\u00a0and the battle will begin. The goal is simple get your opponents health to 0.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>To do this you can use a slash attack using the \"Q\" &amp; \"E\" keys. Which key you use determines the direction of this attack.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Another way of inflicting damage is using the blast attack.\u00a0 The closer the enemy is to the center of this blast the more damage they will take. However if you take any damage, your blast will be locked for the next 3 seconds.</p>\n\n\r\nAI Battles\r\n<p>Upon feedback and request\u00a0I added AI Battles.\u00a0\u00a0More than a dozen unique AI's all with different gameplay styles and difficulties! I\u00a0dare you to beat all of them!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Fun Fact:\u00a0Nearly all the AI's were named after my friends' usernames<br/></p>\n\n\r\nPrivate Battles &amp; Tournaments\r\n\r\n<p>Once again upon feedback and request, private battles are here! Using invite codes you can play against your friends!</p>\n\n\n<p>But what are tournaments? Good question. You get into a lobby with friends, the game randomly matches you for 4 rounds and the player with the most points by the end wins!<br/></p>\n\n\r\nDiscord Integration\r\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>From rich presence to game invites to username syncing everything you can want is here!</p>\n\n\r\nCustomization\r\n\n<p>PC is all about customization and WDM2 wants to continue this trend. You can use all your cool music and wallpapers to create yourself a custom arena! Now you can listen to your favorite tunes and look at your favorite scenery while destroying your opponents. Upon gathering enough XP and reaching level thresholds you can customize your opponents mouse from a separate menu.\u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nChat\r\n\n<p>Probably the most used feature of the first game returns once again! It's better,\u00a0 faster and actually displays your Discord username!</p>\n\n\r\nExtra Credits:\r\n<p>Music: HaronTe, Tuna Mert Iyiari</p>\n<p>That Amazing Wallpaper I Use (Not In The Game):\u00a0TsaoShin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4a64d9854b5cdba2b2340be5fcb98aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DHMelon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
