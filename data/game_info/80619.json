Your mission is to put lines (vertical or horizontal) on the board which consist either of the same color or the same number. An additional rule is that each color in a number line must be different and vice versa: Each number in a color line must be different. Therefore, it is not possible to put 2 tiles with the same color and number side by side, and the maximum length of a line is limited to 6.<br/>You play until no more tiles are left and the player with the highest final score wins.<br/><br/>You can also change the numbers into different symbols.
