You, the player, are there by total accident. The adventurer is meant to rescue his Princess, not you. Can you escape, back to your own world? If so, not easily and certainly not without leaving an indelible mark on the history of Kerovina and its somewhat unusual inhabitants.<br/><br/>Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audio-visually elaborate text adventure games, it was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The original game has been remastered and improved by Stand Games (with <br/>permission) and adapted for modern PCs and mobiles, with a vastly improved UI.</p>\n<p>Features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Touch-Text Commands</li>Tap \"links\" in the text to perform commands without typing.</ul>\n<ul><li>Sidebar Inventory</li>All your things are conveniently listed in a sidebar. Drag and drop to use them or to apply them to things in the main text.</ul>\n<ul><li>Dynamic Map</li>No need to draw out the map, we do it for you. As you explore the game, the map page will expand. Tap any previous room on the map to \"fast-goto\" that location.</ul>\n<ul><li>Compass Rose</li>Quickly navigate with a handy compass gadget. It shows the available exits at all\u00a0 times, simply tap to move.</ul>\n<p>The new facilities make the original game fun and entertaining to play on modern devices. No more dead ends; the remaster has multi-level undo, save/load game and automatic undo from dying!<br/><br/>There's also the original artwork and newly remastered music from the original arist John Malloy\u00a0 (thanks John!).<br/><br/>Find out more at Strand Games<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...<br/>http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?...<br/>http://msmemorial.if-legends.o...</p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<ul><li>Windows Vista or later.</li><li>Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) or later.</li><li>Recent 64bit Linux desktop (Ubuntu 16.04+, Fedora 25+, Debian 8+, Suse Leap 42.2, CentOS7, MiNT 18.1, ElementaryOS 0.41 and similiar)</li></ul>\r\nSupport the Remastering Project\r\n<p>After fees, we get only about \u00a31 from each sale.
