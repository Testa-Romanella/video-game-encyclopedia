I would have started with the first game but its just to far gone so I decided to just rewrite the second game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb22244776bdc228fc9ed91f5ec2460.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Mcgurrin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
