This year I challenged myself to make a game in a month, hence the choice made was obvious to Me, this was 4 months ago (This game was posted in\u00a0August/2020 if you are seeing it past this).</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Soon after the beginning, I\u00a0knew this one month project would take longer, many mistakes were made when making the models of the spaceships would appear, many times redoing the same export process to correct my mistakes. Then came the bugs while coding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0With every error, I became more and more frustrated, at some point the thoughts about cancelling the project and delete it from existence filled my mind, I got burnout. But kept going, was halfway through it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0I tried my best to deliver a good polished experience. It's not my first project, but the first one released to the public in what I see as a complete game. It is a short experience, but I\u00a0hope it will be a good one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Everything about how to play is in the Help menu in the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Feedback is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>LeonM\u00b2(Leonardo Silveira) : Game design, Code, 3d Models, UI, Sound Effects.</li><li>MedicineStorm, bart, Joth and kindland from OpenGameArt: Sound\u00a0 Effects.\u00a0</li><li>Yd and CodeManu from OpenGameArt :\u00a0Music.</li><li>GameSupply.store : Music and Sound Effects.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c7b774626b292e59aef3b35643f4ede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeonM\u00b2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
