{"id": 54307, "slug": "sewer-shark", "name": "Sewer Shark", "name_original": "Sewer Shark", "description": "<p>Sewer Shark is a first-person rail shooter video game, and is the first on a home console to use full-motion video for its primary gameplay. It was originally slated to be the flagship product in Hasbro's Control-Vision video game system, which would use VHS tapes as its medium. However, Hasbro cancelled the Control-Vision platform, and Digital Pictures later developed the game for the Sega CD expansion unit. Sewer Shark is one of the first titles for the Sega CD and one of its best-selling games, leading Sega to eventually bundle it with Sega CD units. It was later ported and released for the 3DO in 1994. A port was also planned for the SNES-CD, but that system was cancelled.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T19:34:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f08/f0821ef4af5142bae01672b2fcd5d01e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "3DO"], "developers": ["Digital Pictures"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
