It gives you a reasonably playable version of breakout! If you are going to fiddle with it, be aware to add some safety to where the computer can POKE to, because the variables area follows the screen and you might crash or freeze the Speccy. I used mostly Marvin and Fuse to write it. Enjoy it !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/644a4992ccbc0bca2cbaf594d3d538e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ivanb303"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
