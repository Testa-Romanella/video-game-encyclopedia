Throughout the dungeon, they will find monsters that they can defeat to gain gold which can then be used to upgrade their spells or stats when they go into the shop which will be accessible in a specific room that spawns in a random position, the player can also buy new spells at the shop but they\u2019ll cost more compared to finding spell scrolls in chests hidden throughout the dungeon.\r\nThe player will need to choose the best combination of spells since they\u2019ll only have 4 spell slots, so there needs to be a good strategy to get to and defeat the boss.\r\nIn order to challenge the boss the player must find the hidden key in a random chest and unlock the boss's room.\r\nThe player will start with 3 MP so in the beginning they won\u2019t be able to do bigger spells, this can be upgraded at the shop. MP can be recovered at the shop or from mana shards dropped by enemies.<br/>\r\nNote: most of these features have not been implemented yet, may be implemented in the future depending on if this project continues.\r\n</p>\n<br/>\r\nTheme Interpretation\r\n<p>In this game the player will only obtain spells that are considered unusual, to say the least, these spells can consist from being annoying to overpowered or just useless most of the time, there are also spells that can summon projectiles that deal more or less damage and also deal additional effects depending on the projectile.</p>\n<br/>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nKeyboard\r\nGamepad\r\n\r\n\r\nMovement\r\nArrow keys/WASD\r\nD-pad/Left joystick\r\n\r\n\r\nAim\r\nMouse movement\r\nRight joystick (Not working properly at the moment)\r\n\r\n\r\nChange spell (Not implemented yet)\r\nQ &amp; E\r\nLB &amp; RB(Xbox) | L1 &amp; R1(PS)\r\n\r\n\r\nCast Spell (Not implemented yet)\r\nLeft mouse click\r\nLT/RT(Xbox) | L2/R2(PS)\r\n\r\n\r\nPause Menu (Not implemented yet)\r\nESC/Enter\r\nMenu button\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSpell List\r\n\r\n\r\nSpell Name\r\nDescription\r\nCost(MP)\r\nMockup\r\nImplemented?\r\n\r\n\r\nEat this!\r\nRandomly throws a food item in the pointed direction - the bigger the item the more the damage, certain items may cause a sticky effect that slows down or stuns, a small percentage of an item actually restoring health to an enemy.
