But damn he knows how to make a good T-shirt.</p>\n<p>Go out there, and give them what they want. An awesome t-shirt. You are the one and only:\u00a0 T-Shirt Man</p>\n<p>Made with Raycasting Game Engine for the E1M1 Jam.</p>\n<p>HOW TO RUN THE GAME:<br/>Extract it and run Tshirtman.exe. If you are having mouse troubles, see NOTE. If you want to use keyboard only, download TshirtmanCtrl.zip instead.</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0If you\u2019re having mouse issues when running your game, right-click the game application in your file explorer, navigate to compatibility and select Change High DPI Settings. Once here, you\u2019ll need to override the high DPI scaling behaviour caused by the application. (explanation from E1M1 Jam)</p>\n<p>NOTE 2: If you prefer using the arrow keys to aim, then download the TshirtmanCtrl so the fire is mapped to ctrl instead of the mouse, so you can play with keyboard only like in the 90s.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD to move, <br/>mouse to look, <br/>left click to shoot (ctrl in TshirtmanCtrl),<br/>space bar to open doors</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>- jabsatz (Art / \u00a0Sounds /\u00a0Music):\u00a0github\u00a0/\u00a0twitter<br/>- GGGelo (Art /\u00a0\u00a0Sounds /\u00a0Musics):\u00a0github\u00a0/\u00a0twitter<br/>- narmuzz (Art /\u00a0\u00a0Sounds):\u00a0\u00a0github<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd961c9b1d45b7b19acad382d1617de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GGGelo", "jabsatz", "narmuzz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
