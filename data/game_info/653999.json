There are some toxic dark matter that will kill you instantly when in contact. So you must avoid them at all cost. The only way to survive or win is to collect the gems and activate all the corresponding pillars\u00a0 with those gems. Once you activate all the pillars, you'll win the game. Of you're not quick enough, you'll eventually be swallowed by the growing dark matter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a very small game but I had a lot of fun making it. It's not perfect, it also didn't meet my initial expectations. But I'm happy about it,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bdca1ae580981345f52089cb520f6ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ix_dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
