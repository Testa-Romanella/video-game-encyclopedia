{"id": 543371, "slug": "dreamcatcher-demo", "name": "Dreamcatcher [DEMO]", "name_original": "Dreamcatcher [DEMO]", "description": "<p>DreamCatcher is the first serious game title I've created by myself, as part of my final college project. It is an experience focused heavily on atmosphere and mood, and has very much been a passion project so far.</p>\n<p>You take the role of a character who was once an antagonist in another story, and who still struggles with the weight of their own guilt from the terrible things they've done. They are plagued by a mysterious magical blight which threatens to take control of them once more the worse their guilt becomes.</p>\n<p>The character has been sent back into their own memories, and is forced to face the things they've done to uncover the fate of the one who has the potential to be the hero of this story, despite the evidence that she's no longer alive.</p>\n<p>Almost everything in this project was made by me, save the ambient sound and music, and some of the fx sprites, though I owe credit to everyone who helped me cope with the stress of the project during the last weeks of the assignment. If you enjoy what I've created so far, let me know! Leave a comment, and share the game with someone!</p>\n<p>* Development for Dreamcatcher is currently not ongoing and donations are currently disabled due to external factors, but I hope to continue work soon and open up donations in future to help fund my work on this and other projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:59:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e81/e814b6dcb7e86aa945cb3e7a93ab9e9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SilenceArts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
