While in the second world, you need to use sugar-coated shells to buy those passers-by who do not know the truth.</p>\n<p>Just as people wreak havoc in war, and use bribes and lies to build damage in intimate relationships.</p>\n<p>And as a rhythm game, you can't shoot through actions, but can only shoot automatically when the music reaches a certain rhythm. In other words, the music actually manipulates the flow of the game. Just as violence is often done not by instinct, but by some broader ideological manipulation.</p>\n<p>The game is very short, about ten or twenty minutes to get through, so I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>:\uff09</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b1d325b6347eef2cdaf3e9cbd888f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GouHong"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
