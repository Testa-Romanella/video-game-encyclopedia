{"id": 496249, "slug": "tristam-island", "name": "Tristam Island", "name_original": "Tristam Island", "description": "<p>After crashing your plane at sea, you end up drifting to a small island, with not much to survive. You explore, and find out the island was inhabited, years ago. But why did the people leave? And why is there a fence around that big building at the top of the hill?</p>\n\n<p>The game will be released in a few weeks; consider this a \"pre-order page\"! (You should pre-order, you'll get exclusive digital feelies!)<br/></p>\n<p>Free demo available on September 25th at this page: hlabrande.itch.io/tristam-island-demo<br/></p>\n\n<p>TRISTAM ISLAND is a text adventure made from the mold of Infocom; expect a large geography to explore, lots of prose, a rich parser, diverse puzzles, some humor and some darkness. To use Infocom's classification, I'd rate the game's difficulty as \"Standard\"; however, the game's design is modern and eschews all the frustrations commonly associated with 1980s text adventures. No hunger timers, no frustrating mazes, no blocking situations that force you to restart!</p>\n\n<p>By buying this game, you get disk images for 31 different platforms:<br/>- Commodore 64, VIC-20, PET, Plus/4, and also a MEGA65 version;<br/>- Atari 8-bit (400, 800, XL, XE), and the Atari ST;<br/>- Amiga (all the way back to the 500);<br/>- Spectrum +3;<br/>- Amstrad CPC;<br/>- BBC Model B, BBC Master 128, and Acorn Electron;<br/>- Apple II, Macintosh, and OS X;<br/>- DOS, Windows (32 and 64 bit);<br/>- Linux (32 and 64 bit);<br/>- TI-99/4A, and also a port for the TI-84+CE and TI-83+ calculators;<br/>- Oric Atmos;<br/>- TRS CoCo;<br/>- Nintendo GameBoy, GameBoy Advance, and Nintendo DS;<br/>- Dreamcast.<br/>You also get the naked \".z3\" file to run in your favourite interpreter, allowing you to play on any platform with a Z-Machine interpreter, including the Spectrum Next, the Raspberry Pi, the Palm Pilot, etc. You won't find many games that can be played on that many platforms!</p>\n\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the game, please leave a comment if you did! You can support my work by paying more than the displayed price, or buying one of the physical versions for retro computers, edited by PolyPlay.
