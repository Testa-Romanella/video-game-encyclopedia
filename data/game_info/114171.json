I can not go on because I still have to learn unity. It should become a survival game with animals that can kill you. I would like your opinion on this game. At the moment you can only run around on the map. It still lacks a craft menu and an inventory menu. does anyone know how to program this? It should also come to a construction menu. At the day / night change, I'm already working and it will come soon for an update.<br/>I'm working on this game by myself and that's not easy. Unity 3d is English, and my English is not good. That's why it's hard for me to develop this game.<br/>Greetings from Germany</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1df/1df129596136c2cbe424267f749b7973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["malon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
