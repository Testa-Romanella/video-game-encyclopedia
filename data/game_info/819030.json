I reccommend you go in blind, but if you want the full ruleset, here it is:</p>\n\n<p>Click the heart for a white die.</p>\n<p>You can only get 1 white die at a time.</p>\n<p>Click and drag dice to deal damage to oncoming enemies.</p>\n<p>If match the number of the your die and the enemy, and the enemy hasn't been damaged yet, you will get a Perfect Kill.</p>\n<p>Perfect Kills will create 1 black die that is yours to use. Black die can also get Perfect Kills.</p>\n<p>A black die that has the number six will become a Crit Die. It will blow up a large area, destroying enemies surrounding it.</p>\n<p>If you get a Perfect Kill with a Crit Die (explosion kills don't count), then 3 extra black die will be created.</p>\n<p>As an added bonus (and something that would be more code just to remove), you can place your die over multiple nearby enemies, dealing the same amount of damage to each. Try and go for the double Perfect Kill!</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347e0161315f55b8476dd770e5cac85b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Malix"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
