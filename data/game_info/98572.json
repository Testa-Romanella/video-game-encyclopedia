Though the crime is considered punishable by death, both police and citizens have come to accept them as part of \"normal\" life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0That is, until one day, a new chief inspector is put into position, who\u2019s determined to rid the streets of intimus once and for all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Now Jericho, deprived of clients, is starving. And the decisions he will make will determine if he dies by the end of the day, continue being a survivor...\r\n</p>\n<p>Or maybe, show him something that's thought impossible in Neo-Manila :\u00a0<strong>love</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>***</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This current build is currently at it's Alpha Stage.
