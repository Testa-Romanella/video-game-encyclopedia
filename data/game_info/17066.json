{"id": 17066, "slug": "consortium", "name": "CONSORTIUM", "name_original": "CONSORTIUM", "description": "<p>The Consortium is the first person shooter RPG, which takes place on the futuristic ship Zenlil. The period for the world of the game is the middle of the 21st century, the time in which all the armed forces were dissolved, and the law-enforcement function was assigned to the police under the name Consortium. The hierarchy on the ship is similar to chess. The player takes control over one of the crew members - Bishop 6, an elite soldier. This is the first part of the trilogy.</p>\n<p>The structure of the plot of the game is often compared with Mass Effect Trilogy - because of the story branches, each playthrough differs from the previous one. A detailed background - the developers claim about 150 000 words in the script - only enhances the effect. Also note the unusual implementation of the dialogue tree: the developers sought to recreate lifelike conversations, each response changes the attitude of the NPCs to the main character. In total, more than 20 characters are available for communication, and the soundtrack of the game was written by the famous composer Jeremy Soule, who worked on such games as The Elder Scrolls V, Company of Heroes and Guild Wars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c717d1808ea116b8c938189432a7c4c.jpg", "website": "http://corporate.interdimensionalgames.com/consortium/", "rating": 2.74, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 97, "owned": 1477, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 35}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 86, "suggestions_count": 554, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 86, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interdimensional Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Interdimensional Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
