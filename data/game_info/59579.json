It is up to players to choose an allegiance with one of the three factions, then progress through offline questing and intense 30-hour online skirmishes, all making use of deep, strategic RPG combat and expansive customization. Race, sex, appearance, job class, sub-class and weapon type are all freely alterable for every team member, so no two knights are ever the same; and unique massively-multiplayer online functionality allows players to test their knights against others from all corners of North America, without even requiring a constant internet connection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/30c/30ce4b7a285f782e555a7442e13e8a34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["VanillaWare"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Marvelous"], "esrb_rating": null}
