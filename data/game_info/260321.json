It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie. The game was invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as \"Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b4a843042d49aad19ce5d308e51d3e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["AppVentures-LLC"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Family"], "publishers": ["AppVentures"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
