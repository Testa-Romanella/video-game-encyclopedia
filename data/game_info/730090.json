That was a computer costing the equivalent of ~US$6,000.00, several times the price of your typical Amiga\u00a0back then. **\u00a0 The point is to show what we could have if we embrace slightly higher minimal\u00a0specs\u00a0\u00a0rather than demanding everything to be OCS/512KB Chip.\u00a0 Could it be done to run on stock A500? Perhaps, but that will demand a near full time ASM programmer + artist +\u00a0musician\u00a0over the span of 1+ year.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>**Bear in mind that just a couple of years ago, games done with AUTHORING ENGINES required 68030+FastRAM to achieve this performance.**\u00a0 To have unaccelerated machines (A1200 here, and A500 for Green Beret) running it, is a big victory for Scorpion Engine.</strong></p>\n<p>What is in this demo?\u00a0The whole level one, with its sections (1-1, 1-2 etc) right up to the boss, which can be destroyed and drops an orb.\u00a0 The basic \"framework\" for the game is set:\u00a0 main character has whip and secondary weapon picked along the way (knife in this prototype), gets 'hearts' for mana by destroying candles, I\u00a0think that I've included all level 1 enemies (except that huge floating eye), enemies have functions (red ones can jump out of the water and shoot at you) etc.<br/></p>\n<p>THINGS THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE:\u00a0 the soundtrack obviously isn't correct, the bgm is \"Bloody Tears\" which is from\u00a0Castlevania II: Simon's Quest and not \"Vampire Killer\"\u00a0from Castlevania 1 like it should be. But this will be rectified as soon as a musician offers help (credits to\u00a0Drillimation for original arrangement, that I\u00a0used for this Protracker 4 channels conversion).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ladders may feel odd, they don't work like in typical Castlevania games, they work more like the ladder in the Mega Drive game \"El Viento\".\u00a0 Summing up, it lacks the other levels and bosses, the other weapons and stuff you pick, and so on, but I'm pleased with the results so far. It plays well. Worth saying that doing AGA game (2MB Chip) is infinitely faster and easier to do than squeezing a game like Green Beret (which may look simple at first glance) on the 512KB ChipRAM OCS A500.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/0495c159b141779542e84b3d28001bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dante Retro Dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
