It takes place in a near-future, where a new VR-based social media network is taking over. People are migrating their online collection of family and friends to homeroom and quickly establishing their identities with the service's built-in tools. As a user, you are exploring a new friend's personal homeroom in order to quickly get to know them through what they publicly present, as well as what you can uncover for yourself.</p>\n<p>In general, most of the technical production aspects of making homeroom were pretty straightforward. We ran into the expected amount of troubles, but not usually through anything systemic. The most difficult parts of production were definitely designing and implementing a content delivery system that made sense with the theme of the game and effectively communicated key information and individually manipulating scene files and having to duplicate them and manually merge them as development went on. Within Unity, we made especially heavy usage of the canvas and UI elements, as well as the built in raycasting in order to have the first-person interactions and physics feel good.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a7c4f97ccc176cc42d33df5a44656df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["katesmith"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
