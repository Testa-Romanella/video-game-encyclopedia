Like any monkey, Coco likes to romp around the jungle near the cove to find adventures to fill its days.</p><p>You can help Coco fuel these adventures by stretching her tail back then releasing. That action flings Coco through the air to collect yummy food. Bananas are a definite favorite, but Coco also likes salmon, cake, and even french fries! Delicious!</p><p>We all have our challenges in life, and Coco is no different. Though you can't tell by looking, Coco happens to have type 2 diabetes. Eating the wrong foods (like too many carbs) or not eating at the right times can affect blood sugar. But, hey, no worries. That can be a bummer sometimes, but with practice, you can help Coco move along to the next world.</p><p>Coco lives a great life in the jungle. Help Coco explore the jungle, overcome many challenges, and\u2026well\u2026live that carefree jungle life that makes Coco happy!</p>5 Worlds<p>From Jolly Jungle to Rowdy Rapids, from Wacky Winds to Fauna Falls...and let's not forget Rocky Ruins. A monkey like Coco needs lots of space to roam.</p>Handcrafted Levels<p>All 100 levels are carefully crafted and made with our love for Coco--and to keep Coco's antics flying high!</p>Fun for All<p>This puzzle platformer was designed with a healthy dose of fun. Why? Because Coco insisted. And we aim to make Coco happy.</p>Beautiful Art<p>On top of fun, we piled on a ton of beautiful art (well, maybe a little less than an actual ton!) to make sure Coco lives in a home worthy of an energetic little monkey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7b0bc67afc0010b7dd2be3b7541ad8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["mariaty"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
