Well, I wanted to do it, and I wanted to code it. I figured out that a ragdoll physic based game was the most satisfying and funny way to do it, so that's what I did using Love2D \"realistic\" physic system. I quickly realised that characters with legs in ragdolls game are a pain to control, that's why I gave him wheels. At the end of the day, I had a bunch of capability which were funny to use, but I had no real idea of level design or of challenges to use these idea, which is why I stopped development. <br/>You can look at the controls menu to see all of the ability of Spider-Wheel,\u00a0 and test them out in my test level.<br/><br/>Credits: The Spider-Wheels scream's sound effect come from this video, sounds for webbing comes from the \"Spider-Man 2\" for the PS2, and the various graphical elements comes from Marvel comicbooks or from free stock photo/drawings websites.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e42a63e7bd566c83fa0b5a794f144e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pordrack"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
