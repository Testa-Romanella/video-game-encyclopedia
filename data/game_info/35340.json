You are a soldier of Tech Com--a ragged team of human-resistance fighters intent upon stopping the cybernetic onslaught in postapocalyptic Los Angeles. The prequel to The Terminator film lets you play as three characters--each with specialized skills and abilities. Your ultimate goal is to travel back in time to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor--mother of resistance leader John Connor. Armies of cyborgs stand in your way, but you&#39;ll have plenty of new weapons and melee moves to clear the path.</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2002-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T11:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3e0/3e0e272fb3d721a200b350eaa2e28441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Paradigm Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Infogrames"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
