The rules of the game are very simple. You play as a Tyrannosaurus Rex that runs through the desert. Cacti will come across on your way, which you need to jump over in time. If you couldn't react - you lost. This is the whole gameplay. If you jump well enough, you can play as much as you want. The desert is looped, and you can run through it endlessly.<h3>Enjoy the Tyrannosaurus Rex game with beautiful 3D graphics and in high resolution.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T04:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02ceede23800b2ecd773fafa1ca4b411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 410, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Performance Artist"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Performance Artist"], "esrb_rating": null}
