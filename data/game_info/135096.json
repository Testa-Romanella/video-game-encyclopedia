It was made for My First Game Jam: Winter 2017. Some quirks persist, and the prototype is a little rough around the edges. If you encounter anything game breaking, you can press the \"r\" key to return to the title screen. You will maintain any progress you have made. Also, Mari's red spell can destroy targets with one hit. Target behavior can be a bit weird at times; I would just leave the room and come back later.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong> Arrow keys to move, \"z\" to jump, \"x\" to cast magic, and \"c\" to select your spell.<br/></p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong> to Jyzavi, who made the shoe; Liam, who made most of the music (the title screen song is borrowed from Link's Awakening); and BMJ from Stencyl's discord server, who helped me out more than once and let me use a behavior he had developed. You guys rock.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c448ad2ad2c0cd6a9b68eae75e79a348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hardheadjed"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
