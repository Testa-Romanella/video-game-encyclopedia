This time it's NOT all about speed, but rather pure skill, concentration, and a little luck. The goal is to get as many of the 4 crates you start with to the finish 'zone'. Each crate counts as a 1000 point bonus to an otherwise falling score. Each time you pass a level you unlock the next level, and possibly a new vehicle! Compete locally and globally to gain the highest score on each of the 40 levels! Then take your unlocked vehicles and hone your skills in the free ride arena!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>-Extremely realistic vehicle physics with accurate suspension, mass, torque, friction, .etc<br/><br/>-Each vehicle feels very different with unique weight, speed, torque, suspension, etc.<br/><br/>-8 Vehicles (1 to start with, 7 unlocked throughout the game)<br/><br/>-40 increasingly Challenging levels with physics based puzzles and challenges (from teeter totters and moving platforms to pressure pad enabled events causing you to be launched into the air!)<br/><br/>-Local leaderboards (top 5 scores for each level)<br/><br/>-Global leaderboards (top 100 scores for each level, includes username, total score, number of crates, overall time, and which truck was used)<br/><br/>-Free ride arena with various obstacles<br/><br/>-5 level skips for when you get stuck and just can't seam to move on!<br/><br/>-Intuitive camera controls let you move the camera to any angle you need!<br/><br/>**THIS APP WILL RUN ON THE IPHONE 3GS, HOWEVER IT WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT FOR 4TH GEN AND ABOVE/I PADS.
