You have to manage the Dragon's energy, hunger and joy. To make the dragon happy you'll have to play a 3D platformer mini-game, where you have to collect items giving different score to reach 50 points before the time limit.</p>\n<p>I hope you will like the game and do not hesitate to tell me what you think of it !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T08:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c327b8cb92c145f066e9e6956ffb28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arnaud VELIA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
