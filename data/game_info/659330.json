You have the option to shoot at moving or stationary targets.</p>\n\n<p>Sniper Targets:</p>\n<p>Shoot at far range targets with a sniper.\u00a0You are able to use the scope or hip fire. Just like the pistol targets game mode, you are also able to specify if you want the targets moving or stationary.</p>\n\n<p>Recoil Targets:</p>\n<p>Shoot at targets with five different fully automatic guns to choose from, each having different recoil patterns. If you play the game Rust, there are 4 guns with identical recoil to help you improve your spray. There is also a general purpose recoil intended for everyone. Just like the two game modes stated above, you can also specify if you want the targets moving or stationary.</p>\n\n<p>1v5 Against Bots:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my favorite game mode. Face off against 5 bots with 4 different difficulty levels for all types of players. You can choose which guns you want to use from the pistol to any of the recoil weapons. Tell me if you can beat the realistic mode as it is quite a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Settings:\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can customize your crosshair type, size, and color. You can also change your volume settings, and mouse sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>High scores:</p>\n<p>If you improve on your best high score, it will notify you on the overview screen. You will also be able to see what your best score is when entering that game mode.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who plays my game.\u00a0This is my first decent sized game that I have finished, so any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c51fd6007e59d6c4107234c5c4c55674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OctaDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
