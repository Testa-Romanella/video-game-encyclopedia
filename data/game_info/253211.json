Nothing to be done about it now. This is going to happen whether you like it or not. But maybe you can learn to like it. You feel your fiance's hand on yours, and realize that maybe, just maybe, you don't even need to learn.</em></p>\n<p><em>Two Months Engaged</em> is a tabletop role-playing game by C. Leary about marriage (and possibly love) for two players. Each person plays one half of a couple set to marry, and together, you describe the last two months before the wedding. It's lightweight and easy to adapt to any type of setting or relationship.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/088a74926d761ed7e990c4ae5f8f0c78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["corvidcall"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
