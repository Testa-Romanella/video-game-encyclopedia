The community contributes greatly to the game, giving it a vast selection of vehicles and terrains from which you can choose. Rigs of Rods is mostly used for simulating vehicles, but it is flexible enough to be suited for other tasks as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T09:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f53104c816f3ee5bb8b9635d5d09de3.jpg", "website": "https://www.rigsofrods.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pierre-Michel Ricordel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
