Double-click the JAR to run the game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Coin Rush is a fast-paced arcade game with 48-hours worth of gameplay! (may require some effort).\u00a0The idea is simple: Collect as many coins as you can before you die!<br/></p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds, a random event happens, be it an increase in enemy speed, or more coins!\u00a0 \u00a0Enemies fall from the holes above. Jump on their\u00a0 heads to defeat them, Mario-style.</p>\n<p>Enemies collect fallen coins. When you kill them, DOUBLE the coin amount is released, making for some interesting combos!</p>\n<p>There is a shop at the bottom, with 4 items you can buy (one after the other).</p>\n\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0 \u00a0The high score database no longer exists. Unfortunately, this means the game will crash after every play...\u00a0 Present me is not proud of past me's failure to compensate for that.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\ud83d\ude12</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrows: Move/Move around the Menu</li><li>W/Z/Up/Space: Jump</li><li>S/Down: Select/Buy item from shop</li><li>Esc: Quit</li></ul>\n<p>Tech used:</p>\n<ul><li>Java</li><li>LWJGL library</li><li>The Slick library, for loading resources</li><li>MySQL Connector, for server connection</li><li>Paint.NET / GraphicsGale for sprite creation</li><li>SFXR for sound effects</li><li>GarageBand for music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T08:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee9c5a264d2301985f4558b7f39fc946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lectvs"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
