Made in Unity.</p>\n<p>There's a ghost in your room! And the only way you can see it is by shining light on it. Pick up your dusty, old flashlight and try to track the ghost down. There will be powerups that spawn occasionally, and you're probably gonna need it because the flashlight's battery is also pretty old and it dies out FAST. Run around and try to shine the light on the ghost before it gets to you!</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment any bugs or suggestions you see down below :)</p>\n<p>WARNING:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights.
