Using a retro-style computer, you'll create color patterns to control elements such as doors, platforms and lasers. Each mechanism is carefully introduced to make the game accessible to everyone.<br/><br/><h3>Think outside the box</h3><br/>In addition to familiar puzzle elements, the centerpiece of the game is the retro computer that generates color patterns. While in the beginning you only create simple patterns to open a door for example, in the later game you automate many elements at the same time to make your way through the levels.<br/><br/><h3>Lets go on an adventure</h3><br/>Explore the abandoned Luoni Energy Competence Center through environmental story telling between each of the puzzles and uncover the history of Luoni Energy and their motivations.<br/><br/><h3>Accessibility</h3><br/>In addition to different color palettes for visual impairments and closed captions that describe audio, there is also a hint system that gives clues to the current puzzle or can solve it completely.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T03:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b5b557912af59327dfbfc93383fc59.jpg", "website": "https://re-touring.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Malte Wei\u00df"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Malte Wei\u00df"], "esrb_rating": null}
