But beware, because time is\u00a0not on your side.\u00a0And the devil is literally evil, so he'll try\u00a0to make this harder after you reach a\u00a0certain score.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0A gamer dies suddenly and\u00a0is meant to go to hell. But since\u00a0the devil is bored, he gives the man\u00a0an option to play a game of numbers\u00a0and win his ticket out of hell.\u00a0The gamer chooses the game without\u00a0any hesitation. But little does he know,\u00a0the devil never planned to give\u00a0him a way out. The devil slowly\u00a0makes the game harder, making it\u00a0almost impossible to win.\u00a0So now he is stuck in an endless loop\u00a0of\u00a0 playing the same game again and again\u00a0while giving the devil some entertainment. Are you smart enough to outwit\u00a0the devil?</p>\n<p><strong>A Game By:</strong> Muhaiminul Yeamin</p>\n<p><strong>Background Music:</strong>\u00a0Myuu - It's Playtime!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0Since webgl builds can't access local files and accessing a file is one of the core components of the game,\u00a0I couldn't do a webgl build.
