The game is very simple, as it is created for your rest and does not require special attention. There are 10 levels in the game, where each level consists of 16 elements that need to be rotated in the right direction and dragged into place. At the beginning of the level, you see the image for 5 seconds, and then it disappears. In this version of the game, the help button has been removed, as it was in previous games, since the levels are very simple. The game will help you relax and have fun. There is a choice of levels and you can start playing from the level you have chosen. The game has built-in voice prompts on the buttons. The game will delight you with pleasant graphics and calm music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:00:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/862f8f381354ce4a39db159b9cf98760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameREA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
