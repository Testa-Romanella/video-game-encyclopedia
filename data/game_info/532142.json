{"id": 532142, "slug": "in-the-stars", "name": "In the Stars", "name_original": "In the Stars", "description": "<p>In the Stars is a turn-based strategy game where the players are trying to predict the future and align their cards into a winning Star Map. Players will have to draft cards onto their Star Map carefully and thoughtfully as the condition to win changes every round. Each player also gets a chance to alter the future as the Oracle, which allows players to use special Boon cards to change and swap cards from each player's Star Map. Hopefully the stars, in this ever-changing universe, will align for one player and grant them the favor of the 12 Zodiacs. This game is for 3-6 players and takes around 30-45 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>https://playingcards.io/je58jn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T09:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e5967099750b623f27a4dcd5a7e66a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ianrlarson"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
