In 1989 ports were released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.</p>\n<p>The arcade version of this game comes in both upright and sit-down models, both of which feature shutter-type 3D glasses hanging above the player's head. According to Computer and Video Games in 1988, it was \"the world's first three dimensional racing simulation.\" The home conversions of Continental Circus lack the full-on 3D and special glasses of the arcade version.</p>\n<p>Circus is a common term for racing in France and Japan, likely stemming from the Latin term for chariot racing. An unrelated 1972 French film about motor racing was also called Continental Circus.</p>\n<p>In 2005 the game was made available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC as part of Taito Legends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f951b53e6b027cc4cef443e26a98f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
