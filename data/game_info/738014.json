{"id": 738014, "slug": "the-outfoxies", "name": "The Outfoxies", "name_original": "The Outfoxies", "description": "<p>The Outfoxies is a 1995 weapon-based fighting arcade game developed and published in Japan by Namco. Controlling one of seven assassins, players are tasked with defeating opponents with different types of weapons, while also avoiding different obstacles brought on by various stage gimmicks. Weapons consist of firearms such as pistols, machine guns and rocket launchers, to more outlandish items such as pie and bowls of hot soup. It runs on the Namco NB-2 arcade system.</p>\n<p>The game was designed by Masateru Umeda, who later created the arcade game Dancing Eyes a year later. It was largely ignored upon release, due to 3D fighting games overshadowing 2D ones and the market being dominated by both Capcom and SNK. In retrospect, the game has garnered critical acclaim for its outlandish and bizarre action themes, often being compared to action films and games developed by Goichi Suda. Several have recognized it for pioneering gameplay elements found in later arena-based fighting games, particularly the Super Smash Bros. series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T18:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a1f0538c28ea7f3a01081ea039d318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
