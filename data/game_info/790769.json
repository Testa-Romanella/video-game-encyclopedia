This world is your own secret garden, and allows you to refocus on yourself. It proposes <strong>positive </strong>messages, incitements to <strong>sport </strong>or <strong>meditation</strong>, in a fairy world.</em></p>\n<p>It is more of an experience than a video game, using no negative feedback, scores or defeat situations.</p>\n<p>My secret place offers for the moment 6 places, each dedicated to an activity:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Meditation</strong>: a guided body scan meditation</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Sport </strong>: Exercise on the beach with a coach</li><li><strong>Nightclub </strong>: Dancing to let off steam and forget your problems</li><li><strong>My confidant</strong> : to confide your problems</li><li><strong>Hide and seek</strong> : Find the rabbits hidden in the forest</li><li><strong>Library\u00a0</strong>: Positive and invigorating quotes</li></ul>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>The game is made to be played in VR.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>If you have a OpenVR compatible equipment :\u00a0</strong><em>(HTC Vive, Valve Index, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest with Airlink)</em></li></ul>\n<ol><li><em>\u00a0Download MySecretPlace_OpenVR and\u00a0Unzip it</em></li><li><em>Launch SteamVR or Oculus application on your desktop</em></li><li><em>Launch MySecretPlace.exe</em></li></ol>\n<ul><li><strong>If you want to install it on Oculus Quest</strong></li></ul>\n<ol><li><em>Download MySecretPlace.apk</em></li><li><em>Use SideQuest to install it on Oculus Quest</em></li><li><em>You can launch it in your app under the category \"Unknown source\"</em></li></ol>\n<ul><li><strong>If you don't have VR equipment</strong></li></ul>\n<p><em>I added a non-VR version just for testing purposes for those who are not equipped. The game being made for VR, this is a very degraded experience : Download MySecretPlace_WithoutVR, Unzip and launch MySecretPlace.exe</em></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The game is made to be as simple as possible :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just look at things you want to interact with (door, rabbit, etc) and press trigger on the controller</p>\n\r\nContext\r\n<p>Game made alone in\u00a0approximately\u00a08 days.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I had planned to put more mini-games and more player interaction, but I didn't have as much time as I wanted to make progress on the jam.\u00a0For example, a diary with the possibility to write down some of his thoughts, audio dialogue interactions, and mini games to relax in a kind of carnival.\r\n</p>\n\r\nWhy VR ?\r\n<p>The ease with which the user can be immersed in a world thanks to virtual reality is a major asset for offering a complete and controlled support, allowing a real break with reality.</p>\n<p>Numerous researches show the interest of virtual reality in certain types of treatment, notably anxiety and depression.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>[Nan Zeng and al., 2018] Virtual Reality Exercise for Anxiety and Depression: A Preliminary Review of Current Research in an Emerging Field\u00a0</li><li>[A.
