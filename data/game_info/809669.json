With new virtual reality tech and user-created worlds, you and your friends\u00a0used to spend hours exploring, dressing up your avatars,\u00a0and meeting new people in the strange digital environment. But that was years ago: even though the servers are still running,\u00a0Any.One Online is practically a virtual ghost town. For nostalgia's sake, however, you decide to log back in.</em><em>\u00a0What you find is a surreal landscape only barely related to what you remember, a decade\u2019s worth of unsupported code, scattered costumes,\u00a0and the looming feeling that something's not right\u2026</em><br/></p>\n<p>Made for the sixth Dream Diary Jam using RPG Maker 2003, Pixaki, and the\u00a0YNFG template\u00a0provided by the incredibly talented\u00a0Clockwork Prince. Music by the equally talented\u00a0Enonigmus, with a bonus track by\u00a0voxelectrica.\u00a0More detailed credits can be found in both the game proper and the readme.txt file.</p>\n<p><strong>-- WARNING: Game contains flashing lights and rapidly changing colors.
