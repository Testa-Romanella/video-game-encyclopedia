The difficulty is based on how many tiles are removed from the grid, and an algorithm will be added later to ensure the easy, medium and hard puzzles can be solved using normal strategies versus some puzzles being solvable only using a computerized brute force strategy.</p>\n<p>The over all goal for this is to allow others to test the project and leave feedback. This is planned to be a part of a larger project, in which a collection of logic puzzles and AI competitive board games are playable. Potential multiplayer as well for the board games - but multiplayer can be very programming intense.</p>\n<p><strong>How to download:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1) Download the zip file - Feel free to use a virus scan for your protection!</p>\n<p>2) Create a new folder and unzip the contents into the new folder. This folder can be anywhere, such as Program Files or on your desktop.</p>\n<p>3) (Optional) Create a shortcut by right-clicking on the \"Neo's Sudoku\" application, and clicking on the \"Create Shortcut\" in the menu that appears.</p>\n<p>4) Open the application and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T07:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73e1f6a86b75c361bb15d062b9f48811.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neohanja"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
