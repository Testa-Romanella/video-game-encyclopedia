I have from Monday to Sunday each week to work on a new game (or prototype, really, given the time constraint) and release it to the public. At the end of the project, if any of the prototypes show promise, I hope to return to at least one of them to flesh it out into a full game.</p>\n<p>My main goal is to learn game development skills and experiment with different genres and game making engines. Jump Space is a GameMaker Studio 2 project.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. I'd love constructive criticism and any bugs you encounter (there will be many).\u00a0Also, let me know if Jump\u00a0Space is a concept that you would like to see me return to in the future after the game-a-week project is complete. You can follow me here on itch.io to be notified as my weekly games are released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f141df2d4941569decd3166dcc192d6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Foutz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
