Stan! what are you doing, get those souls back here!</p>\n<p>well... Stan just stole a bunch of souls which means the\u00a0 hounds will be after him, Thankfully he has that candle to help guide him, but of course theirs always the possibility that the candle goes out, or he could get lost or the hounds get him... oh! maybe you could help him? but how would you do that?... ooh I know! you could use\u00a0 the WASD keys, or those arrow keys,\u00a0 or a controller,\u00a0 even the\u00a0 ZQSD keys if you have an azerty keyboard! you can also drop a soul as a distraction\u00a0with the space bar or the A button or the whatever the equivalent of that is for your particular controller. anyway thanks for taking care of Stan for me, remember to keep him and the candle alive, bye!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f542acf8aa6abd4e3e90d5f83103e78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Spoonizee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
