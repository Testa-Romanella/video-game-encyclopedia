What started out as a meme of an idea, has turned into an experiment that I think is worth trying. Instead of guessing what the people want, spending months or even years developing a game that I only\u00a0<strong><em>think\u00a0</em></strong>the public would want to play, why not let the people shape the game?</p>\n<p>No, I am not talking about letting the community\u00a0<strong><em>REFINE</em></strong> a game, which is what happens 99.99999999% of the time. No, no this is different. From day one, all y'all are gonna play this pile of pointless poop and start suggesting ideas for features and mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My hope is that eventually this game will turn into a sandbox full of random, useless mechanics that serve no purpose other than to see what happens.</p>\r\nThe rules are: there are no rules\r\n<p>The way this works is you, the user, will be given one feature/mechanic suggestion per week. Each weekly suggestion period will begin on <strong>Mondays at 12:00AM PST</strong> and end on <strong>Sundays at 11:59PM PST</strong>. At the start of each week\u00a0the coolest/funniest/most random\u00a0suggestion will be selected and implemented during that week.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order for this experiment to work, the features and mechanics need to be something that a solo developer (<em>i.e. moi</em>) can implement within that timeframe. Delays are bound to happen, and if a suggestion is good enough, development on that feature will continue until it's been fully implemented.</p>How to participate<p>To take an active role in the development process, please join the\u00a0official discord\u00a0where you will find a link to the submissions form in the #<strong><em>announcements</em></strong>\u00a0channel and be able to discuss the project with other community members.\u00a0</p><p>There are also some gaming channels and some off topic discussion areas for you to en joy whilst not discussing EAS.\u00a0Links to both discord and twitter can also be found under\u00a0<strong>Community Links</strong>\u00a0at the bottom of this page.</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>Obviously the experiment will be available free of charge, however if you're feeling super generous, I will gladly accept any old, sticky loose change you find between your couch cushions. All donations would be put towards the development of the game and definitely not used for buying inflatable dinosaur costumes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually if the project garners enough interest, I may even throw the project source up on github and see what else the community can come up with and implement on their own.</p>\r\nThank you\r\n<p>If you've made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to see what this is about. I think it's going to be really fun and I can't wait to see where it goes. Have fun, and don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n<p>This is not a completed project! In it's current state, there is almost nothing to this game! The idea is for users like you to suggest features and mechanics that will shape what is possible in the game and what you will be able to do.</p>\r\n\r\nCommunity Links\r\n<p><strong><em>DISCORD:</em><em>\u00a0https://discord.gg/hHgprKn</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>TWITTER:\u00a0</em></strong><strong><em>https://twitter.com/earlyaccesssim</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94ce630e0361fdfe1f672ca4315751d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BBrown4"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
