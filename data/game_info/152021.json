{"id": 152021, "slug": "outbreak-itch-rich-court", "name": "Outbreak (itch) (Rich Court)", "name_original": "Outbreak (itch) (Rich Court)", "description": "<p>In Outbreak, you will guide the spread of an aggressive virus, which attacks the host's cells, and turns them into copies of itself. Those copies then aid the spread, until all the host cells are gone. However, the hosts immune system will present you with many problems, like forcefields which kill off all but the pure original virus cell, and fighter cells, which will patrol and kill virus cells on sight. You must use all your cunning and skill if you are to win.</p><p>Thanks for checking out the Outbreak early access beta - please have a play and give any feedback that comes to mind - it will shape how the rest of the game is made. Note that the game of course is not yet finished, and that there are currently only 8 levels available, with a <em>fairly </em>steep learning curve. That will of course change in the final version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/1756e8a56b7d1d891f05a6e874257198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rich Court"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
