While showering, I came up with this idea of a puzzle game involving lights, and switches. It turns out this game idea\u00a0already existed haha:\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)</p>\n<p>This is just a prototype, and a test build.\u00a0I would love suggestions on how to change the game mechanics a bit to make it more original.\u00a0Let me know in the comments if you have any ideas. I will probably open source the game as well.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, I found the higher levels\u00a0a bit challenging. I hope you enjoy playing it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e30f2717030fb3822f56cfa018da2bdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Diogo Vernier"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
