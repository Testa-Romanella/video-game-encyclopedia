{"id": 970333, "slug": "alchemelee", "name": "Alchemelee", "name_original": "Alchemelee", "description": "Alchemelee is a potion-brewing party game, where you\u2019re a potion brewer with pedestals to fill and neighbors to compete against. Set up your garden, grow ingredients, then get to brewing some potions! From there, it\u2019s up to you whether you want to use them to be the first to meet your goals and win the game, or throw them into other players\u2019 gardens (or back into your own) and see what happens!<h3>Features:</h3> <strong>Controller support.</strong> You can use either controllers or the keyboard to play. <br/><strong>Play with up to four players.</strong> Compete against other players to cause chaos and try to be the first to complete all three potions that you need to win. <br/><strong>Catapults!</strong> Self-explanatory. Use them to throw things at other players or to affect your own space. <br/><strong>Choose how you want to approach the game.</strong> Start the game by planting things in your garden and setting yourself up for the rest of the game with automatically regenerating bunches of ingredients, or choose to spend time just rummaging for individual ingredients as you need them. Do you brew just the potions you need to win, or will you make something that can cause chaos for other players and might buy you more time? Up to you! Pick a game plan that works for you or switch it up with every game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T07:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daea358a33c63a3783b04bbac0833c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Skyglow Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skyglow Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
