Players take control of Delsin Rowe from the third-person perspective in the open-world environment. The story takes place in Seattle 7 years after Cole McGrath\u2019s sacrifice and the annihilation of The Beast (the ending of inFAMOUS 2). The protagonist is a 24-year-old local from the Akomish reservation. He has a Conduit\u2019s superpower that gives him the control of different materials. Delsin also has an extraordinary parkour skill that allows him to climb vertical surfaces. Having supernatural power, Delsin is set up against mutant hunters from Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) As the story progresses, Delsin comes across new Conduits and acquire new special abilities spending Blast Shards scattered throughout the map of Seattle. While completing Delsin\u2019s story players are able to choose whether they want to follow the good branch (healing civilians and stopping unnecessary violence) or the evil branch (murdering innocents and redundant enemies).</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2014-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T05:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/be2/be239d5eb4d0bf02bf722aff51e694ad.jpg", "website": "https://www.suckerpunch.com/category/games/second-son/", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 208, "owned": 3768, "beaten": 1469, "toplay": 176, "dropped": 239, "playing": 58}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 228, "ratings_count": 1599, "suggestions_count": 647, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1613, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Sucker Punch Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
