The road Leon finds himself on seems to be a rift between Earth and the place where monsters come out to play. On this road, Leon is confronted by differing horrors including zombies, skeletons, and ghosts.\u00a0You play as Leon and must CRUSH enemies and SURVIVE another\u00a0day!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Features:</strong><br/>Three Game Modes: <strong>Campaign Mode</strong> (manmade), <strong>Infinite Mode</strong> (endless gameplay), and <strong>Crush Mode</strong> (objective-based):</p>\n<ul><li>Campaign Mode - The main game mode is defined by designated levels. There is an end to this mode and progress through each level is tracked by a fill bar.\r\n</li><li>Infinite Mode -\u00a0This is an endless level tracked by checkpoints. At each checkpoint, a boss fight will occur and the speed of the level increases. Points determine success in this mode allowing for highest scores to be recorded.\r\n</li><li>Crush Mode -\u00a0An additional mode to the game is Crush Mode. The player must complete the objectives listed in order to complete the level. There are 3 levels to Crush Mode currently.</li></ul>\n<p>Health -\u00a0Player damage to health is visually represented by speed decreases. Getting hit by enemies or obstacles will result in a decrease in speed. The player can only afford a few speed decreases (hits) without dying. Upon too many hits within a 5 second time span, the player dies. As the player\u2019s health regenerates following each hit, the car\u2019s speed increases back to normal.</p>\n<p>Score -\u00a0The player can earn points by crushing enemies and/or completing levels. Points in Campaign Mode are earned by crushing enemies and points in Crush Mode are earned by completing the objective in each level. Points are not gained in Infinite Mode.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Boss Sequences:<br/></strong></strong>Boss sequences occur as Leon nears his exit.\u00a0There is one boss encounter in each Chapter of Campaign Mode.\u00a0The sequences have a focus on allowing the player to learn the boss\u2019s patterns and emphasize movement.\u00a0The player is able to attack and defeat the boss by using crush.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Cosmetic Shop:<br/></strong></strong>The player can spend points in the Shop to customize their looks.
