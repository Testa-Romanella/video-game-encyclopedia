{"id": 561526, "slug": "potion-quest", "name": "Potion Quest", "name_original": "Potion Quest", "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>You play as a traveling <strong>potion </strong>master and you <strong>fight </strong>against monsters you meet along the way in<strong> turn-based</strong> combat. Use your potions against your enemies, and after battle,<strong> collect their remains</strong> to brew new, more powerful potions. Can you make it through the <strong>enchanted </strong><strong>forest </strong>and the <strong>haunted </strong><strong>graveyard</strong>?</p>\n<p>Use your potions <strong>wisely </strong>and make sure to head into combat with a stockpile, lest you <strong>run </strong><strong>out </strong>and get <strong>overwhelmed</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Potion Quest is just played with a mouse. In battle, open up your potion inventory and click on the potions you have to read what they do and use them.</p>\n<p>Outside of battle, brew potions with the cauldron in the top right. Click on the potions to see their recipes and brew them. You can only brew potions you have the ingredients for.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made independently by SquidGodDev (@SquidGodDev1). Music is made by Bertsz.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks (If stuck):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- You can go back to previous battles to farm more ingredients. However, encounters you have already beat won't drop health fragments, the main ingredient for health potions.</p>\n<p>- You can go to an easy fight, like the first one, to use your healing potions and not lose as much health when you're using them.</p>\n<p>- Sludge potions are very powerful as they hit all enemies at once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a3a7f04b940e11277940394390dfe3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquidGod"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
