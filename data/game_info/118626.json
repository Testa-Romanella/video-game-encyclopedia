{"id": 118626, "slug": "flint", "name": "Flint (itch)", "name_original": "Flint (itch)", "description": "<p>Platformer, developed for the 2017 GMTK jam.</p>\n<p>Hold space to propel yourself forward, release to shoot. Left and right arrow keys to change direction. Collect the coins.\r\n</p>\n<p>The dual purpose mechanic in this game is merging movement and attack\r\n into one action. More often than not, this is a disadvantage to the \r\nplayer. It can prevent them from attacking an enemy, because they have \r\nto stop (and fall down) to do so, or it can prevent them from moving in a\r\n certain way, because it would result in an attack that destroys one of \r\nthe coins.</p>\n<p>The game runs on Windows 7, not sure about later versions. I wrote the code and drew the sprites by myself using Game Maker 8 and Paint.NET 4.0.16 respectively. No sound or music.<br/><br/>POST-JAM UPDATE: Remade the game in Unity with some level and physics adjustments. Added sound and music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf8d4c787d1def72ad50fa09e9c0def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nyuu3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
