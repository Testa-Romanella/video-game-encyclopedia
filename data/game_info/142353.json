It's a short, audio-only, stupid adventure, where you use your phone's touch-tone dialpad to navigate a cave in search of a dragon. IVRs are those pre-recorded voice menus that you have to navigate when calling a business -- <em>press one for this, press two for that, </em>etc.<br/></p>\n<p>There are two versions of the game. The original was written as an Asterisk dialplan script, and could be played over a VoIP connection. The second version was hastily ported over to the Kivy Python framework.<br/></p>\n<p>Source code for both versions is terrible is available. A 64-bit Windows build of the Kivy version is included in the downloads section.<br/></p>\n<p>I am setting this project's Release Status to 'On Hold' as I have not been able to test the dialplan version on a recent version of Asterisk, nor have I gotten packaging of the Kivy version for Linux / Mac to work. I successfully tested the Windows version on WIndows 10 64-bit, though it failed on a virtual machine that didn't support OpenGL 2.0. I hope to tie up these loose ends someday when I have more free time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd2c58eb19d257988e5cfffa42c24f07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rabbitboots"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
