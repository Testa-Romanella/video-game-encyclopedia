This allows the player to progress through the game and find the keycode to escape the house before the\u00a0timer hits 0. Locate items by uncovering clues and exploring the game world; certain items are necessary for progressing in\u00a0the game and revealing more aspects of the narrative. By piecing together bits of dialogue and game imagery, the player will be\u00a0able to find the code to escape. A keypad by the living room door will enable the player to escape the house and end the game loop\u00a0if the proper code is inputted.</p><p>\n</p>by <strong>Untitled No. 5</strong><br/>\n<p><strong>Game\u00a0 Director:</strong>\u00a0Maurice Hendricks<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Art &amp; Music Director:</strong> Ian King\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Animation:</strong> Isaiah Saunders\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Design:</strong> Miles Every</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a55e5c4975cefe56e53acc6a2102f6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maurice Hendricks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
