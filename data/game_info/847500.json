I also made some custom \"music\" which is honestly pretty bad but I'm not a musician. Hopefully your ears can forgive me. I decided to add power ups as well, which will help you in different ways.<br/><br/></p><p>One thing I should add is I completed this project maybe 1 and a half to 2 years ago, so this has been finished for some time, but I never really thought of uploading it until now. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f084a04813b4997854850489287c2eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VinnyBot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
