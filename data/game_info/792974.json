The goal for this internal game jam was to make a proof of concept for our third game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Emily pitched to Tom and Sam the idea of a gullible archaeologist being convinced by his evil boss to go through ancient ruins with his\u00a0magical lantern to remove artifacts for \"safe keeping\". The level that you play through here is a very simple version of that idea.</p>\n<p>Since it was made in such a short period of time, please expect bugs and things to be a little bit jank in some places.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sam Barham, programming and game design</li><li>Tom Garden, art and game design</li><li>Emily Latta, game design and sound design</li></ul>\n<p><strong>MUSIC:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Ossuary 4 - Animate\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T17:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e795d19b888f8e61184c84aec2f6433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balancing Monkey Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
