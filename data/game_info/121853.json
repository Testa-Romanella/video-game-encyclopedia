Made for the 2015 Write A Game jam. Thanks to my wife Sarah for providing the scenario and writing.</p><p>You play the game as James, an ordinary boy who must battle unusual foes. But there's a catch to them... This is a short game, easily finished in 10 minutes or so, as per the contest's rules. The game deals with issues like emotional abuse, fear of abandonment, and living with mental illness.</p><p>In addition, there are two difficulties: Normal, and Difficult. It's recommended to play through the game on both difficulties at least once.</p><p>Also, feel free to leave me feedback on what you think. </p><p>This was my very first game ever completed, I had a lot of fun making it. :)</p><p>Changelog</p><p>V1.2 - Minor gameplay tweaks, eliminated the installation step, and fixed an error preventing the game from playing. If you've received the error \"RPG Maker 2003 RTP is not found\", try this version.</p><p>V1.1 - Fixed some bugs, reduced the filesize, and changed some text for examined items.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd0c989dfb4d8033a56d9d4c7f8ead64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cadwyn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
