That's.. it's a.. you gotta make it to the fridge factory to sleep in a fridge, it's too hot to be outside the fridge. Don't be that dog. The dog that is not in the fridge on a day like this. Just don't become a pile of ash on your way home. That would be boring for everyone, don't waste your time cooling down though. Being as warm as you are, you're bound to piss off everyone around you with your steaming heat, or something. You can use all arrow keys to control your dog (you are the dog).</p>\n<p>If you came here for colors, you are in the right place, this game has vivid colors. Expect the dog to be upside down randomly every few frames. It is literally playable, it's not a feature. You make your own music to this game, it's slow instrumental reggae. You have to hum it yourself when playing. The rest must be left to your imagination.</p>\n<p>This game is not designed to be played by dogs, it's for humans and monkeys, but you are free to regard it as dog and animal friendly, safe for use. It contains no loot crates, or gambling of any kind. The game is however illegal in nine countries - obtain at own risk. Made in Godot.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Rune Wangen - code, animation, shader</li><li>Enou - All 2D art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3abb01732e83cc05728ee0a7ebe66644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Runetass"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
