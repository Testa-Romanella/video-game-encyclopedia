Everything is going great until multiple portals leading to unknown places open up and start sucking everyone into them. In the confusion I get knocked out. I wake up after having a weird dream and that's where the demo starts off at. Hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e84/e84642d805b201e2d32764906dd47163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBlackBlur23"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
