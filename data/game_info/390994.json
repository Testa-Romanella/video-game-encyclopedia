The power balance of the world is forever altered by the discovery of the destructive A-bomb. From former British colonies in the South East Asia, US spies came back with the disturbing news of communist insurgents creating nuclear weapons. Nobody knows how they got their hands on uranium to fuel such a weapon and the required knowledge to make it. Faced with the dangers that communist terrorists could pose to the US and it's allies, the CIA Directors have decided to send their top man, Jack MacArthur to investigate the rumors and if they are proven true, to sabotage the nuclear capabilities of the terrorists. Still haunted by the horrors of the Korean War, Jack sets forth to eliminate the threat not only to the US, but to the whole world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:27:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2ee0971cbce4c299b0a86e007fe53b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amaterasusoftware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
