They are many and you are one. Defend your Island as long as you can.</p>\n<p>The more drills alive, life drain will be faster.<br/></p>\n<p>Drills will spawn randomly across the map and each drill has some enemys that protect him. Kill them to deactivate the drill's shield.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W / A / S / D</strong> : \u00a0Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> : \u00a0Attack</p>\n<p><strong>Space :</strong>\u00a0 Dash</p>\n<p>There is also controller support that works like a charm and quite a bit better that Mouse+Keyboard but sadly WebGL has quite the problem to detect controllers.</p>\n<p><strong>Contoller controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left stick :</strong>\u00a0 Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Left shoulder button :</strong>\u00a0 Dash</p>\n<p><strong>Right shoulder button :</strong>\u00a0 Attack<br/></p>\n\n<p>I played CrossCode lately and liked the combat quite much, so my goal was to create something similar.<br/></p>\n<p>I overscoped again so i had to cut many features i had in mind like combos , \u00a0different enemys and a better AI. the groundwork is lied to also implement\u00a0 more interesting enemy behavior and attacks but i dont have the time to implement them. But the system i build is pretty solid and will definitly get used in other projects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T18:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29a26cff8dc14ff0f7acea329f5a93bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cubzer"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
