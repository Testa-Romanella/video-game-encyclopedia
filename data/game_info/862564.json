The Theme was \"Every 10 Seconds\".</p><p>- \"What if instead of changing rules of a game every 10 seconds we will just switch the game every time?\"<br/></p>\n<p>- \"...\"</p>\n<p>- \"Will you program it for me? &lt;3\"</p>\n<p>- \"...\"</p>\n<p>A short game of 6 even shorter games which switch every 10 seconds raising difficulty each time.</p>\n<p>NB! Fullscreen on monitor of not 16:9 will have edges of game cut out.</p>\n<p>Controlled with Mouse only!</p><p>------</p><p>As some commenters pointed out:\u00a0</p>\n<p>In case you get confused on Card game - you're supposed to beat cards from hand (bottom of screen) to the cards on the table (middle of screen). You can do this by grabbing a card from hand, hovering it over on-table card and then release. In order to beat cards they have to be of same suit and your card needs to be higher value. Also there is master suit (shown in top-right corner, under the pack) which will beat any other suit not matter the value. You can grab new cards from pack on the right.</p><p>------</p>\n<p>P.S. The latest version (30 min late to LD submission deadline)\u00a0has fixed aspect ration which took time to figure out how to fix. Aspect ratio still breaks in fullscreen, but at least it's not always broken... First submission is available for download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6abb8ef9f6d632d5ef935e5ee5b209ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vidim888"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
