{"id": 975534, "slug": "ditherdream", "name": "DitherDream", "name_original": "DitherDream", "description": "<h3>The Archipelago</h3>DitherDream is a trippy little exploration game set across an archipelago of strange islands. In each island, you must attune to the world to reach your next destination. This can mean attuning to specific objects to open the portal to the next island in the primary cycle, or activating other means of going to other places in The Archipelago. Each island is a unique, hand crafted experience, some with unique mechanics, and all beautiful in their own way.<h3>How to Play</h3>DitherDream controls like a typical first person game, and is generally enjoyable by those of all skill levels. There is no danger, and no time pressure when traversing the primary cycle. However, accessing the many hidden areas of The Archipelago will require taking time to fully understand the islands that you traverse, and most of the world is hidden.<h3>Exploring The Archipelago</h3>You have access to a diagram of The Archipelago that will gradually fill in as you visit more and more islands. Every session begins at the center, but from there you can navigate your way across the primary cycle, a circular network of small islands known to you as Ways. Many of the Ways will have a little stub next to them on your diagram, indicating that attuning to that island more deeply will allow you to travel deeper into that region, instead of continuing to traverse around the primary cycle. Successfully doing so is one key to unlocking the secrets of DitherDream.<h3>The World Breathes</h3>Every pixel of The Archipelago is alive with bits of motion and flow, and learning to interpret that motion will serve you well. With a careful eye you can learn to understand the intent of the world, and let it guide you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T07:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df5/df530b87504f47e27db8e3936f348861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DitherDream"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DitherDream"], "esrb_rating": null}
