Theme: Joined Together<br/>Submission for MiniJam 82: Theme: Doodle, Limitation: Only one room<br/></p>\n<p>Content: Do you despise playing scrabble with others? The feeling that everyone knows more words than you? Well, now this time is over. Obgoose is a singleplayer non-competitive scrabble-like game where no one will ever know when you are obtuse.</p>\n<p>Explanation:<strong><br/>1. Why am I a goose? Honk!</strong> Move by using the arrow keys.<strong><br/>2. My goal?</strong> Join letter tiles and form words.<strong><br/>3. What about the points?</strong> You score a point, if you are using all letters and build a connected crossword of valid words.<strong><br/>4. The letter tile is in an unreachable position?</strong> Push it out of the screen. It will reappear.<strong><br/>5. I got too many bad letters? </strong>Push one letter tile into the well. It will punish you by giving two letter tiles back.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Arrows and Mouse<br/></p>\n<p>Idea, art and programming: dunkelgrau<br/>Music: azix<br/>Sound: CC0 assets from https://opengameart.org/<br/>Fonts: DigitalDisco (https://www.dafont.com/digital-disco.font)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:07:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672d279be3ee8f63788ceee080bfa607.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["dunkelgrau"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
