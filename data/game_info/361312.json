In order to adhere with the theme, I\u00a0decided to try a game where multiple characters respond to the same, single command. Now it is just 4 levels, so to make it harder I\u00a0also added a single life. Once you die, you start back at the beginning. But don't worry, you can always reload with the R button before losing all your stupid single minds!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:06:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49f8bafa10fa73db9961d7af5efa73cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["albebrando"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
