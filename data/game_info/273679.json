{"id": 273679, "slug": "champion-of-survival", "name": "Champion of Survival", "name_original": "Champion of Survival", "description": "<p>A 2.5-D survival-type game created for the Ludum Dare 43 jam. Since this is the first time I've done a real game jam it's probably a little rough around the edges, but hey, it sorta works. Everything was created in 72 hours except the Unity engine and its default post-processing effects. The biggest sacrifice in order to fit the time limit was the ability to come up with a good title.</p>\n<p>The game itself is quite short, consisting of 7 stages of (hopefully) increasing chaos and difficulty, and features a combined 3-D and pixel art style. Each stage the maximum weight you're allowed to carry decreases, so you may have to sacrifice items as the game goes on. Eventually, there are magic attacks which don't weight a lot, but instead drain your health! I haven't tested it enough to know how hard it really is, but it is possible to beat. I think.</p>\n<p>Created primarily with Unity 2018.2.8, Blender 2.79, Krita 4, Audacity, and Visual Studio. Everything that you see was made specifically for this jam with the exception of the fonts, which I made for another project a few years ago.</p>\n<p>The game \"window\" can be resized using the plus and minus keys any time when the game is open. All other controls are viewable in-game (or check the screenshots).</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/60255a0958d7a67a2ab8e08c8b428823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["noitatropsnart"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
