The catch is that all the art had to be done in one pass - each main screen had to be drawn within a 2 minute time limit (the basic story had to be worked out during this time too). Room content sections (a drawer, cupboard etc.) had a 1 minute time limit. No going back to fix things!<br/></p>\n<p>This was a personal exercise to make me take an alternative approach to making a game, and to push past \"trying to make it perfect\" causing small projects to never get released.</p>\n<p>Although many corners were cut and the art is a bit of a mess, I hope it still fulfills the purpose of being an enjoyable experience!</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>:<br/>You wake up in the middle of the night craving a snack.
