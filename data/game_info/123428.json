I did it at the 2015 GaymerX Dev Game Jam. I used the Unreal Engine 4 including art and audio assets. I based it off the provided tower defense demo and modified it heavily for fast addicting gameplay inspired by one of my favorite tower defense games - Bloons Tower Defense 3. I tried adding support for the Tobii EyeX Eye tracker device but couldn't get it working in time. I was intending to have the gold drops be picked up with your eyes. I am continuing to work on it in my spare time to add eye tracking support and polish it more!</p><p>To play:</p><p>You start off with 500 gold that lets you buy towers. Click on one of the blocks in the center of the map to buy one.</p><p>There are three types of towers:<br/>a cannon that tracks and shoots a single enemy<br/>a flamethrower (will eventually be a goo thrower) that slows down enemies but doesn't damage them<br/>an arrow launcher that shoots straight and pierces through enemies, destroying any enemy it touches.</p><p>You win the game if you survive through all the waves.<br/>You lose the game if three spheres make it to your base.<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/>Epic: Unreal 4 Engine,<br/>Tower Defense Demo,<br/>Art Assets (UI, gold coins, sounds.)<br/><br/>Tobii for their awesome EyeX controller<br/>Bloons Tower Defense for the inspiration</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17d9db02a6af38bb8ad8ee22805c26e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Randy Martinez"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
