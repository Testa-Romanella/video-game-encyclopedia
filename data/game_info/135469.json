You are a vampire who have been overthrown by a rival and left for dead. You need to find a victim to feed off, then use your time-stopping powers to get revenge.</p><p>Unusual commands: DRAIN, STOP TIME, START TIME (note: the last two can only be used after you have drunk blood).</p><p>Still a bit rough around the edges, but it's a functional game. I may polish and expand it sometime in the future.</p><p>A walkthrough can be found here</p><p>The game can also be played online here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d57/d573ad8a8b4b6afa0445569e5ae91511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christina Nordlander"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
