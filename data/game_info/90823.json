Watch as space empires endure epic struggles for power. You decide if you want to:<br/>\n</p>\n<li> Watch in <strong>Observer</strong> mode</li><li> Play around freely in <strong>Sandbox</strong> mode</li><li> Take control in <strong>Emperor</strong> mode</li><p>Compared to the Android version, this version has <strong>No ads</strong>, <strong>Timelapse</strong> (just press the number keys) variable screen size. But sadly no Leaderboards. And of course performance should be much better.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Empires will:</strong>\n</p>\n<li> Wage war to conquer more stars</li><li> Build ships to fight and do other strange things</li><li> Encounter strange space monsters</li><li> Venture out on intergalactic quests</li><li> Research new technology</li><li> Switch politics between expansion, fortification and more</li><li> Build powerful (or useless) artifacts in space</li><li> Transcend to unimaginable hyperbliss</li><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUltimately they will go away, crushed by a stronger race, victims of internal strife, eaten by space monsters, or some other fate. But new ones will take their place. It's the hypercircle of interstellar life in space.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Emperor mode, you can control your own empire by using your Flagship to boost expansion and defense, build and control your ships, and manage your Spy network.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn Sandbox mode, you have full freedom to do pretty much what you want. Make empires degenerate, throw meteors at them, etc.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOr you can just observe, like an aquarium, except with interstellar space empires instead of fish.\r\n</p>\n<p>Do you want to join<strong> beta testing</strong> for the PC version?
