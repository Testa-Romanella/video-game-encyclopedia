Hoping to change the whole system, he wants to meet Jonas. Jonas travels forward in time while MIRAI #167 takes the opposite route - they want to meet in 2055. Their route will not be as easy as they thought when they both discover they are fighting with forces greater than themselves.<h3>AN INNOVATIVE AND CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY</h3><br/><br/><br/>Much more than just a runner (or endless runner) game - control two characters on one screen, swapping them and using each character's unique characteristics to overtake and defeat enemies.
