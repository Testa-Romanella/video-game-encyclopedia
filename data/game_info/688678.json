Now I'm submitting it for the 5 years of Bitsy jam! It's still unfinished* but I'm publishing it anyway. This also fills the themes of: ghosts, tea, flowers, apple, vanilla bitsy, and probably some other more abstract themes. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>*There's a dialogue bug and it makes it really hard to get the best ending but every time I figure out what the problem is exactly, I run out of spoons to actually fix the problem, and by the time I get the spoons back, I've forgotten what the problem is. The game is still fully playable, but if you don't get a great ending, it's not your fault it's mine &lt;3</p>\n<p>If you want to definitely avoid the dialogue glitch, make sure you put a flower on a grave <em>before</em> you talk to a sad ghost! (You also must do this\u00a0to get the best ending, in addition to some other things such as giving an apple to some squirrels and not to the shopkeeper, petting the dog, and taking an egg)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/093e77ff54d685e1a9215c95f29f47f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fortwas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
