Help him on his quest by making him make as many monetary mistakes as possible!</p>\n<p>Started and completed during Trijam 117, with the theme of \"don't learn from your mistakes. repeat!\" In this game, the goal is to make \"mistakes\" in order to lose money. Optimally, this would be better shown if there were mechanics like a boss that gets mad for making the \"mistakes,\" demonstrating how the guy is really making the wrong choices. But I am happy with how it turned out, even though it's pretty simple at the moment.</p>\n<p>Will likely work on this in the future!<br/></p>\n<p>[Also, stocks don't really work like this, but that's okay!]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e0264848cc5382031837329cedebd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rodulane"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
