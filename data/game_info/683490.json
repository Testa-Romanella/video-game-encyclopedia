As soon as anyone uses the wolf, he or she has exactly 200 days left to live.\r\n</p>\n<p>The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look zombified. A marked person feels like a cat badger to touch.\r\n</p>\n<p>Cuthbert gets hold of the wolf, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into his mind: a dog lizard balancing on a wolf fishmonger, an old newspaper headline about a motor accident, a hooded horse ranting about eyelashes and a drinking well located in a hilly place.\r\n</p>\n<p>When Cuthbert notices his thighs have badger-like properties, he realizes that the curse of the zombie wolf is true and calls in his lover, a fishmonger called Ruth Williams, to help.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ruth examines the wolf and willingly submits herself to the curse. She finds that the same visions flash before his eyes. She finds the dog lizard balancing on a wolf fishmonger particularly chilling. She joins the queue for a supernatural death.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Art :\u00a0Ansimuz\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Szadi Art.\u00a0&amp;\u00a0PimenArt\r\n</li><li>Music :\u00a0Retro Indie Josh\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T04:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f22019539e7b6af0305f4ea2208ce49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScheeliteStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
