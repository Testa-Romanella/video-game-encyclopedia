Space to break apart and to pull back together. Q to toggle perspctive, R to restart, and esc to go back to the main menu.\u00a0You are trapped in purgatory.

Of course, it's an uneasy alliance, and if I had more time I'd make that influence anything but I don't.</p>\n<p>Pretty happy with this game,. I wish I had more time for the sound effects, and maybeee a cutscene or an ending. I'm also not too happy with the art, and did rush the level design. But it's a game jam. And I learned alot.
