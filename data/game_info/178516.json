The objective was to make a game small enough to fit on a floppy disk.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You control four paddles, all of which move together as one. Balls will bounce around the room. They're white in the middle of the room but become either green or red once they leave the middle. The idea is to let the green balls leave and keep the red balls in so that they can become green balls. Let enough green balls out to win.</p>\n\n<p>All music/sound files are licensed from SoundSnap.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/003b1de8f11b6f626c3c7d5ac5d8f32a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theta and Pi Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
