Anna \u201cThirteen\u201d Charlotte, to identify the source of the signal and find out what happened to the Colony.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Inspired by the great hallmarks of the Metroidvania subgenre (such as Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Guacamelee!), players make use of their enhanced abilities to traverse the large interconnected world of the Colony while fighting fierce enemies and challenging bosses with both melee and long-range combat techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Explore MARS:</strong> Explore the different scenarios like the Surface of Mars, Caves, Offices, Quarters, Labs and a lot more.
