It was coded in C\u00a0using the Sega Genesis Development Kit (SGDK).</p>\n<p>The game is free to download and play, but\u00a0a small donation of\u00a0$1 will get you the <strong>fully commented source code</strong>! I've deliberately kept the game simple, so that it can serve as an entry project for anyone interested in coding a game for the Mega Drive.</p>\n<p>It shows how to:</p>\n<ul><li>Place tiles</li><li>Move and animate sprites</li><li>Collide sprites</li><li>Add sound effects</li></ul>\n<p>And more!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have also written a full step-by-step tutorial teaching you how to create the basic version of the game. You can find it here on my website, along with other tutorials on Mega Drive programming!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and if you end up using the code to create something cool, make sure to let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c62869e51343faa3c59fae43fb7495d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["and0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
