You play with a Ronin (a chess queen) and you <br/>need to eliminate the other pieces in order to get close to the Shogun and kill it. Pieces move like in chess, but push each other like in sokoban.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In <strong>Soccer Chess</strong> you will play a soccer match using chess pieces.
