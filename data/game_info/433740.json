That was extremely stressful, but overall I'm fairly content with what I've made in 3 days... or technically 1 Day 1 Hour 47 Minutes. The mini-games functionally I'm happy with, but graphically (as some I had to do the art myself) not so much. Well... all bar frogger and snake. I wanted to get the snake to move smoothly, but after many failed attempts, I gave up... it's a jam game after all. Frogger I didn't have time to look for sprites that I could use, and would they fit in the game even if I found some... probably not. Overall, however, I like the aesthetic of the game. Special thanks to Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl) for almost all of the graphics. The audio (all done by myself) I'm extremely happy with; the main song turned out really great and the sound effects fit well with the nature of the game.</p>\n\n<p>If you participated in the Jam, please feel free to give this game a rating here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fca161f952598bdcf46c58cc19a9d072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Primed_Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
