The current problem with typing games is that they either have compelling gameplay but are too static and short, or they are infinitely replayable, but have very boring gameplay. Scribe wants to bridge that gap and build a typing game that has a layer of customization, strategy, and depth that keeps people coming back and improving their typing skills.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T12:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4f6b626f58755167806fa0fa7e281ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["josfeld"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
