Slay zombies to earn experience. When you level up, use the skill points you've earned to purchase new skills! Get as far as you can before the zombies can kill you!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing everyone! There are some known bugs (like the fact that you cant unspec a skill point if it has a node after it, even if that node is supported by a different skill). Please tell me if you find more. It does have a habit of crashing due to a problem with ram security, but im not sure how to fix it, or if its even a bug on my end. The game is very in progress, but will be updated a lot I hope, as I have a very easy system for adding more skills. Things to expect in the future are varied waves and enemies, items and equipment, and more skills. If you have any other suggestions, let me know in the comments or message me on discord @\u00a0Oktopuss#7756!</p>\n\n<p>Also, i know there is no sound. I dont like writing music or creating shitty sounds, but im also to poor to buy any sound assets. so yeah.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:59:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oktopussss"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
