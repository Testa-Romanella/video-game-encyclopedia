Score to expand your terrain until you control the entire board and win, using zany power-ups to help you along the way.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>PADDLE FORCE is best enjoyed with a friend and two gamepads. You can also play with the keyboard.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul>\n<li>You can only move within your side of the board</li><li>Score on the opposing goal\u00a0to expand your terrain.</li>\n<li>When you capture the whole board, you win!</li><li>Hit <strong>Powerups</strong> into the opposing goal to activate them.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSay hi!\r\n<p>PADDLE FORCE is brought to you by the following fine folks. We'd love to hear from you.</p>\n<ul><li>@flukeout\u00a0did some code and pixels.</li><li>@secretrobotron\u00a0did even more code.</li><li>Devon handled the sound design and music.</li></ul>\r\nFound a bug? Have feedback?\r\n<p>Let us know in the comments section\u00a0below, and we'll do our best to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>When a\u00a0 gamepad is connected via USB and Bluetooth simultaneously (e.g. a PS4 controller), it will act as two distinct gamepads. If this happens to you, choose one or the other: disconnect from bluetooth or unplug from USB.</li><li>PADDLE FORCE runs best in Chrome and support for other browsers is highly experimental for now.</li><li>Sometimes, you're unable to select gamepads for both players\u00a0on the splash page. However, this does not affect your ability to use them in-game. Choose gamepad for one player and keyboard for the other, and you will be able to use both gamepads when the game starts.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T20:37:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/864c0b1081ab27b1a8265c3e5268777a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["flobotron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
