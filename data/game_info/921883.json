Its idea came from younger siblings fighting over leftover soda</p>\n<p>This had a very slow start as figuring out how to get glasses to fill up and then check if they were even by a certain amount was definitely the most annoying part once I got it done and got to work on the other stuff though? it went a lot more smooth, a chill dev time making a simple pouring game</p>\n<p>Sound Design was a fun part of it, recorded the pouring sound myself, straight out of the bathroom faucet, compressed, equalized, given backing from other water samples (SGM soundfont), and mixed for you pleasure. Also wanna mention the meow sounds from after pouring, those were done with the meowsynth vst and I'm really happy with how they turned out</p>\n<p>Big Thanks once again to Bridgette for the music track, I asked for something bar-sounding that was silly and lighthearted (with a required xylophone), what she gave me made for something really filling, puts a lot of personality in the game\u00a0</p>\n<p>For once in a game jam, I'm submitting a game completely satisfied with the end result, if there's any major issues then that's on me entirely, otherwise, I don't think there will be a post jam update this time</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>liluo link:\u00a0https://liluo.io/bowties8glasses/sorting-sweets</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16c/16cfa85eddd9c54ed0a9025a39ad4dde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Bowties8Glasses"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
