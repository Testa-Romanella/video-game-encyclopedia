Xalimi was defeated, but the artifacts remain and, over the years, have gained minds of their own and still harbor the desire to see their master's dark plans fulfilled. <br/><br/><strong>Remie</strong> and <strong>Alana</strong> are magical girl trainees tasked with hunting down one of these artifacts that is hiding in an abandoned mall. As they make their way, they'll discover not only their own magical powers but also their blossoming feelings for each other. </p>\n<p>This release is a demo version that lasts for about thirty minutes to an hour. The full version is in progress and will be released in the future.</p>\n<p>A game made for the 2016 Yuri Jam, by unity, Ocean and Kloe!
