That week, we had\u00a0to pick a game made by a classmate during the semester, take\u00a0the central idea from it, and try to execute that central idea better than original game did.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0picked a game where the player had to navigate an obscured maze, using only sound to figure out their position and environment. For the central idea, I\u00a0wanted my game to be about players struggling for information that\u00a0they could easily gather if they had a clear visual.</p>\n<p>After free-writing some things for inspiration, I got the idea of using sonar to see the environment. That train of thought eventually led to this game.</p>\r\nLicenses for the Fonts Used in the Game\r\n<p>(These are also included in the downloads as .txt files)</p>\n<p><em>https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/carrois-gothic</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/poly</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/2211c99e790260d97f0972cf186ccb07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["RahulJoshi"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
