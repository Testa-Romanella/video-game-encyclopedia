Especially, when annoying players destroy your map and you have to watch the coastlines to orientate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pro tip: Guess - you won't know every capital.</p>\n<p>Erasterra is a game designed for learning geography. It teaches how our earth looks without stretching and where the cities, rivers, mountains and countries are on the globe. Furthermore, it lets you compare your knowledge with your friends and other people by competing against each other.</p>\r\nPre-release\r\n<p>The builds are pre-release. Be aware that not all bugs are fixed and important features might be missing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also: We as a team mostly meet for development parties and therefore are not the fastest in throwing new builds in virtual space.</p>\r\nPlay\r\n<p>When pressing on \"Play\" you get into the matchmaker which automatically starts, if ten people are available. If at least two players are in the matchmaker, it starts after 120 seconds with the players in the queue.</p>\r\nSingleplayer\r\n<p>If you like to\u00a0play in singleplayer mode, you can do so by holding ctrl and pressing the \"Play\" button. After the loading screen, you can then start the game manually by pressing \"Start!\" at the top of the screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1b241b6e41455fb4b2bc7315f341b84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coff\u00e9 Junk Studio"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
