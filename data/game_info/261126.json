Made by\u00a0 2 game designers and 4 artists. It was for the most of us our first game jam and the total building time ended up on around 17h.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our theme was Halloween. Fitting for the time it was made. When we started the project we asked ourselves, What is Halloween for us? And then we put all our ideas together and made this 2D side-scroller platformer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is to help our ghost to get to his grave so he can rest in peace. With the heavy weapon you must swing and smash your way forward. Trick or treat on you and good luck. Hope you enjoy our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5401d913178f1804cc9fde8ca04c4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["lukasax", "Pandrew"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
