The story mode, which is exclusively single player, has ten minigames, including cockroach stomping, arm-wrestling, slide puzzles, shooting contests and the classic car bash. Players earn money through pit fights and side missions, upgrading Kyle&#39;s moveset by training in various gyms in Metro City while progressing through the game. An &#39;instinct&#39; system allows you to counter opponents&#39; attacks, as well as make your attacks more powerful.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>The arcade mode is a no-frills 3D brawler for 1 or 2 players. It does not have upgradable movesets, counters or instinct abilities. Kyle, Cody, Guy and Haggar are all playable characters in arcade mode. However, the game is over when the life bar is empty.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s save system can only be used once the player decides to quit the game. Progress will resume at the last checkpoint rather than the character&#39;s last position.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-26T03:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c4/3c4a2257072d306aa8ab8bf2e04b14ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Capcom Production Studio 6"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
