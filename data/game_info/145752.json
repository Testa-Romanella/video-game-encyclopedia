Ace Messenger is a 2D, flying action shooter taking place in a steampunk-themed world where you control an airplane and must fight to survive from one airport to the next. Use your machine gun and other items to destroy Empire enemies trying to stop you from getting word out about their super weapon. Destroying enemies will give you score which can be used to buy upgrades and consumables in-between levels at the airport shops. When you have advanced enough, you will come across the super weapon ship itself and must destroy it before it reaches the end of the level!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/995a21c8129cb6f9e0c4c4026402049d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silverknight01"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
