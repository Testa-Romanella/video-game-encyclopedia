In this game, more than 15k particles of three types wander around the screen, each controlled by eight different parameters, together forming a complex and interesting bionic system.<br/><br/>You will get a glimpse of many interesting laws of nature in the work, which are simple rules for individuals that evolve into complex group behaviors. From the smallest cell division and ant pathfinding to the largest crowd gathering and dispersing and bird migration. Players can twist knobs and adjust parameters to explore the metaphor of life and explore biodiversity in advanced parallel algorithms.<h3>Core Features and Gameplay</h3><ul><li> Each particle can observe a certain range of neighbors and react<br/></li><li> Drag the knob with the mouse to change the genome of the particle swarm, creating countless different combinations<br/></li><li> Swipe the screen to move the position of the particles to create the particle shape you expect<br/></li><li> Browse several exquisite presets, render high-definition pictures, save and share<br/></li><li> Import and export parameters through the clipboard and share with others</li></ul><br/>Parametric Life is an exploratory project based on the study of complex systems, and we hope you can create your favorite parameters in it, release stress and have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T02:54:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1acfed75298ae1574ac49b40dfd0cc.jpg", "website": "https://parametric.creature.plus/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ni Hao"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ni Hao"], "esrb_rating": null}
