You can solve for repXace and dispXace where they intersect in a puzzle. <br/>You can test your favorite quotes as cryptograms simply by typing them in converting to ALL CAPS and solving. The program treats anything in all caps as a cryptogram.<br/>Although the solutions are limited by a time out and character limit (to prevent huge solutions from tying up your device) you can cut cryptograms down and solve for small sections.  <br/><br/>In this Pro version you can set your limits.  Up to 240 x 5,000 word solutions and 6000 seconds ( 10 hours).  But BE WARNED \u2013 if you do a deep search you will have to use FORCE QUIT to end the program early.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d61/d61118e5b33a2667ccc0d2f2a2365636.jpg", "website": "http://www.geniusat.work", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["David Curran"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["David Curran"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
