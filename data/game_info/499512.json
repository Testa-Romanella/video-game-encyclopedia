The university is S.A.E. London and a prototype was made to gather data for the project. <br/></p>\n<p>Would be great you could help, it takes at most five minutes to go through the game, you always re spawn once the you die, but nothing is reset for research reasons. This is a basic prototype, it is not per say a game so there is not many mechanics.<br/></p><p>Excuse me for the bad U.I. and menus, I\u00a0 just threw something fast together.<br/></p>\r\nThe controls:\r\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\r\nResearch:\r\n<p>At the end of the play through there's a questionnaire that needs answering, please do it.<br/></p>\n<p>This tutorial will gather two files, they can be found inside \"DungeonBalancer_Data\" folder once completed the play through , the files should be of type \".csv\" (Which is basically text files or Excel files). At the end please send those files to my email to help out with this research:</p>\n<p><em>pedro.rainha.dev@gmail.com</em><br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834d4000cccbfdece079a1437fa62f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedro Rainha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
