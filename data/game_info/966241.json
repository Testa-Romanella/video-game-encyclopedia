A few months back as a break from our main project we created a little free game - Hank: Straightjacket. The experience was so invigorating that we decided to repeat this exercise whenever we get burned out. In the weeks before this year\u2019s Summer Steam Next Fest once more we felt exhausted\u2026 And so\u2026 we took a breather and made Starship Murder. This game is an experiment in creating tension. We\u2019re not exactly sure how people will interact with it :D If you\u2019d like to share your playthrough we would be very happy to watch or read or hear about your experiences in any way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T03:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/832cb3142e79fc4805870d10af8b05f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["My Next Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["My Next Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
