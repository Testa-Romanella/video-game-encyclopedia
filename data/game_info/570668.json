We made all the assets ourself in both Maya and Blender.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our aim for the graphics was to make a low-poly office environment with a feeling of abandonment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How the theme is incorporated: You are \"Linked Together\" with a power cord. Your goal is to cut the link. The Game starts out in a small room as a tutorial room to get familiar with the mechanics. You're even introduced to a tutorial on what the colors have for meaning in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your aim is to solve each puzzle for each level to find a way to cut the cord that is linked to you. The puzzles can vary from linking together cables to putting boxes on pressure plates, but it is\u00a0your mission to solve these puzzles for yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy our game and thanks to the Game Jam administrators for hosting this wonderful event! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T06:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e722f440f74d781e24005ea09c02279d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel", "Nicks", "StunkyBoi", "Sanni", "PercyWithoutMercy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
