The Field changes according to the music, with enemies and obstacles appearing to make things more difficult.</p>\n<p>Also to note, since this is still in development, even though all of the game is played with controllers, the menus (in the lobby and the pause menu in the upcoming version) works with the mouse currently! I am also planning on adding keyboard support to playing the game itself.</p>\n<p>This game is still early in the development progress, but I\u00a0wanted to put it out to see if there is any interest in it, or just to have something more in my portfolio. I'll keep updating this for sometime at least, so if you like it but think its too early, come and check it again later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e8761548ba4bda36a4ec7d5552b1c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steelfraud"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
