Amerzone was originally released for Windows, the classic Mac OS and PlayStation in 1999, and re-released for iOS and Android in 2014 by Anuman Interactive, whom had bought out Micro\u00efds in 2009.</p>\n<p>Like the comic, the game tells the story of a French explorer, Alexandre Valembois, who goes on an expedition to the mysterious South American country of Amerzone. There, he discovers many fantastical animals including a species of magical White Birds, who require human intervention for their survival. These become threatened when a friend of Valembois turns Amerzone into a brutal dictatorship, and Valembois endeavors to rescue the endangered species. The game adds a journalist as the player character, who continues Valembois's quest as the man nears death.</p>\n<p>Amerzone received generally positive reception. It was praised for its atmosphere and visuals, with critics claiming that it lent it a poetic and dreamlike quality; while criticism targeted the sound, controls, and difficulty. It was a great commercial success, with over 1 million copies sold in its original release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4144a384cfee45578efcc6ad9dbd4d91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "PC"], "developers": ["Microids", "Anuman Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Casterman"], "esrb_rating": null}
