{"id": 935128, "slug": "neptunes-daughter", "name": "Neptune's Daughter", "name_original": "Neptune's Daughter", "description": "Story\u00a0\r\n<p>Deep under the ocean's waves, not far from Neptune's Palace lives the evil sea snake, whose only pastime seems to be the kidnapping of the Neptune's daughters.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was originally developed by Mark J. Taylor in 1983 for the C64. Although it is not the best game released for the C64, I loved it at the time and spent many hours with it.\r\n</p>\n<p>With this demake I want to bring Neptune's Daugthers back to memory so that this beautiful game is not completely forgotten.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0Only the directional pad and the X button are needed to play. With the control pad you move the diver and with the X button the diver can fire shots with his harpoon.</p>\n<p>At the lower part of the screen there is a display which shows the oxygen that is left. If the diver runs out of oxygen you leave a life.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nLevel 1-3\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0In the first three levels, the diver moves through a cave passage. In the process, he is pursued by an octopus, which can be kept at a distance by well-aimed shots.</p>\n<p>But be careful - only one shot can be fired at a time. As long as this shot does not reach its target, it is not possible to shoot again. In part, areas of the cave passage are obscured by water plants. They need to get destroyed to be able to pass.</p>\n\r\nLevel 4\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0In the fourth level you will enter a larger room of the cave. There are piles of amoebas hiding there, which you have to destroy with well-aimed shots. If an amoeba is hit, it releases oxygen that can be collected. Please note that only one shot can be fired at a time. You will not be able to complete the level without using these extra oxygen supplies.</p>\n\r\nLevel 5\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0The fifth level takes place outside the cave in the area of an old ruin. In the crumbled structure on the right side there is a sea snake that holds Neptune's daughter captive. You can free her by feeding the snake. When it has received five giant crabs, it will release the daughter of Neptune.</p>\n<p>Crabs can be killed by shooting. Once you have killed and caught a crab, you can use it to get to the snake through the window of the ruin. Drop the crab by pressing the X button in the tongue area and the snake will eat the crab.\u00a0When shooting and catching the crabs, you have to be careful not to touch the moving crabs and the falling columns. The seahorses next to the snake do not pose any threat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T11:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f223d14e39cd38f87853e01e86e2855d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Moggi-Synth"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
