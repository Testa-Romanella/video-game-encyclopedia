Player movement has been shifted to physics based model to allow more fine tuned control. A collision tileset has been created to also allow for level design that increases difficulty as the game goes on. There are currently 3 levels to play through, each progressively harder than the last. I will probably add more in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Font Used:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/alagard.font</p>\n<p>Music Used: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Rolemusic/The_Pirate_And_The_Dancer/04_rolemu...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29a07fe57fec79994e7988c7a20ded70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alytalante"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
