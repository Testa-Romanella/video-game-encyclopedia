Developed from January to June of the 2021-2022 school year.</p>\n<p>You will find yourself boxed into two rooms, connected by a catwalk, each with an arcade cabinet. One will expend coins while the other gives you coins with every victory. But you will find the gameplay more intertwined than at first glance. Plus, you need to buy time at the arcade game that eat coins because you'll survive longer with the shield generator powered. If not, well you won't have to worry about playing them anymore.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T10:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9ea50d344210c245be4f48a792bb6a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dyllistan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
