Which Came First brings together flappy bird mechanics and interesting puzzles.\u00a0 The controls are intentionally clunky and frustrating that the game is somehow fun.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The shift keys flap the wings. Yes, that is how you fly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has no other controls other than clicking the buttons with your mouse.\u00a0</p>\r\nGeneral Mechanics\r\nFlying\r\n<p>When the wings flap, as it would work in the real world, the chicken will move in the opposite direction and rotate away from the side you clicked the button causing the balance between the two buttons to be essential to moving around.\u00a0</p>\r\nShrinking\r\n<p>This game is a race to the finish as you age backwards constantly.\u00a0 This backwards aging is the key to the game. As most chickens start as eggs, the de-aging process ends with the transformation into an egg. This egg is the ONLY thing that can activate buttons to open doors.</p>\r\nButtons\r\n<p>Every single level (except for the first one) has buttons that can only be pressed by the egg. Each button opens a door (and sometimes shuts another one) and most are a part of the puzzle.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhen in Doubt, Drop an Egg on It", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0fa1cb860ae553faa6dadac756e568f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["goatloard999"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
