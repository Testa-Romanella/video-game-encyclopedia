The slowest being the green ones and the fastest being the red ones.</p>\n<p>Your main tool will be your Comm-0-do-re 64 sprayer, which will\u00a0eliminate each of them effectively. If you press its button several times, the\u00a0shooting cloud will rise, making it a more deadly insecticide, as well as reach\u00a0places that previously seemed inaccessible. For better control of your\u00a0movements, plug your joystick into port 2 of the device.</p>\n<p>Your modern device will detect in the upper part of your display the\u00a0number of eggs left for each of the separate insect variants by its pigmentation.</p>\n<p>Armed with his sprayer, you must make each and every one of the pests disappear\u00a0from the 5 greenhouses where rare plant species is being grown.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p><em>Music:</em> <strong>Narcisound</strong></p>\n<p><em>Graphics:</em> <strong>Lobo</strong></p>\n<p><em>Programming and idea:</em> <strong>Darro99</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:07:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e7e973f4b2c317118725a285126263a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["darro99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
