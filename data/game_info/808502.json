Now that you have had to interact with Earth's atmosphere, your equipment\u00a0 are malfunctioning. Your shield which was supposed to protect you from incoming projectile, and to let outgoing projectiles pass, is now allowing incoming projectiles, but blocking outgoing projectiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How To play:\u00a0</p>\n<p>W-A-S-D to move around. LMB(Left mouse button) to shoot.\u00a0 Press 'E' when you are near a chest to open it.</p>\n<p>Use your cursor to point and shoot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press `Q` to Switch weapon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press `Escape` to open, and close pause menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MOST IMPORTANTLY: HAVE FUN, and I would\u00a0LOVE to receive feedback from you.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I was originally planning on adding dialogue, and collectable items so that at the end you would go and repair your space craft. But since my time frame for the project was only one month I decide to make a fun shooting game, an explain the story in the details here.<br/></p>\n<p>Click here to see the full development process:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Devlog</strong></p>\n<p>Click Here to join my discord and receive daily\u00a0update on my WIP Projects!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Discord\u00a0Invite</strong></p>\n\n<p>Screen Shots</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T18:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267af6001909d0304edfac2d121000e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TyrantsWrath"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
