Dive in the VOID-MATRIX, created by crazy scientists at FutureVision, and fight your way through the robots and guardians of the depths.<br/></p>\n\r\nTo go deeper we need to find a stage with the highest iteration value, since it's the most unstable.\r\n<p><strong>An end is a new beginning</strong><strong>.</strong> A single layer of the void has multiple iterations of it's level. Go through all iterations and you can advance to the next depth.<br/>Every layer starts with a basis, which gets built upon. <br/>The deeper you go, the more distorted reality becomes.</p>\n\r\nWe just broke our depth record. Agent 6214 reached layer 41 in 11 hours, 42 minutes and 14 seconds, Earth time.\r\n<p>What's at the bottom? Is there a bottom? Will you be able to leave in a singe piece?<br/></p>\n<p>Created for the Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1 by:</p>\n<ul><li>D\u00e1niel \"Fuwa\" Mayer</li><li>Tam\u00e1s \"SETA\" Sz\u00e9p</li><li>(Gaspar, with his unending amount of support)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T17:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcdb55a8570f58c53679f2f1470edff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["OKNO Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
