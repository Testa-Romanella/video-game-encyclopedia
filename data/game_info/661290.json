The only difference is that this game's purpose is not to show you how great I am at coding <strong>life-like</strong> physics. No, this is about Unity physics. By playing this game you will see how great is the Unity physics engine. For a better experience, I suggest you turn the sound on.</p>\r\nWhy should you play it?\r\n<p>Personally, I think that this game is worth the time you will spend on it. You need to click one button, and you are playing. No money spent, downloads or other waitings.</p>\r\nIMPORTANT\r\n<p>I published the code from this game on GitHub. It is about collision detection. If you are a developer, follow this\u00a0link.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:24:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95f9ebb7a916e65b9e4c6e92cc4b3c71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZeroPiGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
