Because this was my first time taking part in a Ludum Dare 46 game jam I was really nervous and unsure when to start, but once I had my idea and a plan to follow everything became less stressful and more enjoyable.\u00a0 At This point I would say that the hardest part of this challenge is number one\u00a0 getting the idea. This was an issue for me not because I'm not creative or anything, in fact I had multiple ideas in mind; but my issue was choosing the perfect one. Then the only other obstacles that I faced was wanting to add more and more and more. The issue with this is that there was a time limit and I knew that I wouldn't be able to complete the wanted feature in time, which just became a disappointment throughout. However, I enjoyed the whole experience and recommend it to everyone to trey out. :)</p>\r\nThis game was made for Ludum Dare 46!\r\n<ul><li>My Submission:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/skip-a-beat</li><li>This is my first every Ludum Dare Entry :)</li><li>Hope you like it!</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Down Arrow: Move Down</li><li>Up Arrow: Move Up</li></ul>\r\nPrograms Used:\r\n<ul><li>Unity - Programming Engine</li><li>Blender - 3D Modelling</li><li>Photoshop - All 2D Assets</li><li>Premier Pro - Cut-scenes</li><li>\u00a0Audacity - Audio</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c830011ad7be8d4d9d2735894baac4f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ZYGER"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
