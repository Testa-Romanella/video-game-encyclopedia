Rather this is an example of how we want the game to work. Some systems are not present but many of them are. In this prototype you will experience:</p>\n<ul><li>Brutal combat against 4 types of unique enemies</li><li>Wielding 4 high impact weapons</li><li>Meeting 3 unique allies</li><li>Exploring 5 types of environments</li><li>Vertical game play with complex but intuitive clambering mechanics (parkour)</li><li>Puzzles</li><li>Solving the mystery of what happened at KRI</li><li>And more...?</li></ul>\n<p>We have had a lot of fun working on this and we hope you enjoy what we've made. We are excited to continue building the DENIZEN experience and want to hear your feedback, so when you've played the demo please tell us what you think in the forums below!</p>\n<p>If you are interested in following the project you can also\u00a0join our mailing list.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy your stay in the Kepler Labs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>- The Skunkape Interactive Team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98dac151ea17b1f8bd562c10e2d1934b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skunkape Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
