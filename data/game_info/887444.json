Later that year, his unpaid intern broke into his house at 3:30am. But he was very close to wetting his knickers so abruptly went against his plan to do a number 1 in the toilet . it was this place where he found the notes of dead Nickel and he stuffed it in his pocket and forgot about it. he could have make millions from patents if he hadn't forgotten.</p>\n<p>later that week, his wife put his knickers in the washing machine and his million-dollar notes were gone. He could only now make everything from scratch and his brain.</p>\n<p>the result: a pretty bad cipher on itch.io</p>\n<p>however, it served a great purpose in the Korean War, where it was used to communicate the lunch menus between the really high commanding officers.</p>\n\n<p>**the above may be or not be satire(and completely made up).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T11:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08f37e06cbdc16e545320c76edb2d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yellowtrees"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
