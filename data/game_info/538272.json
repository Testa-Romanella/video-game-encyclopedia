By shifting what spectrum of light you can interact with, you can\u00a0activated doors, discover hidden platforms, and\u00a0avoid dangerous spikes!</p>\n<p>This game was built in 72 hours for Deynum Studio's \"The Completion Jam\". With a theme of \"out of place\", our game approaches this in a few\u00a0ways. You move reflectors that are out of place to open doors, you switch spectrums to disable out of place platforms, and you move out of place\u00a0color changers to manipulate the color of lasers. Sometimes, you are in the wrong spectrum to solve the puzzle and is what is out of place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Made with 100% original code, art, and music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2403ba6eb81f7b05e129014cc32491.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Option 2 Games", "GrantW"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
