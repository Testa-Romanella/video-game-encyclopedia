Learn the attack patterns to resist the anti-biotics and survive.\r\n<p>\n<strong>RESIST/SURVIVE/INFECT</strong> is a abstract bullet-hell game based around the theme of anti-biotic resistance. You play as bad bacteria and as if you weren't getting it rough enough from the good bacteria in the body, you now have to contend with an anti-biotic onslaught. Only by learning the anti-biotics' 8 unique attack patterns can you become resistant to them and infect the body you're invading.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCredits:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLee Kempton - Programming.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRudi Prentice - Programming.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t                                                                         Pharez Vitalis - Programming.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t                                                                     Adrian Wrzesinski - Art.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t                                                                               Ciar\u00e1n Jai Cosway - Audio.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMusic Soundcloud Links:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGeneration 0 (Prologue music): \r\n\thttps://soundcloud.com/cjaimusic/generation-0<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tInfection (Main game music): \r\n\thttps://soundcloud.com/cjaimusic/infection\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChange Log:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tv 1.0.1 - Fixed resolution bugs and some issues with the final cutscene.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tv 1.0 - Intial release.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8acbf2e6f5cb5136dfc966039f74368.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loaded Games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
