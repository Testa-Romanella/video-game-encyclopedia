Each game was cobbled together, one person at a time, with nobody knowing what they would be working on until they got it. It was an experiment in collaboration and building on the work of others. It was also an exercise in creativity, letting go of intention and surrendering to the communal flow. It was a lot of fun!</p>\n\n<p>Only 3 people ended working on this game. Unfortunately, all three of the  final signed up participants couldn't contribute, so the game was left in an incomplete state. However, it took on a lot of depth in a short time. It started out as a pretty simple series of rock-paper-scissors graphs, and ended up with a detailed rules system and a whole set of absurdist game items.<br/></p>\n<p>You can download the game as it was after each day here.</p>\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Day 1 - Jake O'Brien<br/>Day 2 - Woody Fentress<br/>Day 3 - Jessica Creane</p>\n<p>There were also Exquisite Corpse tracks in Unity, Twine, Phaser/HTML5 and PuzzleScript.\u00a0 Check them out!\r\n</p>\n<p>The jam was inspired by the Exquisite Corpse parlor game, invented by the surrealists.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4ea0f87aad4628898019bce5ff12d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhillyGameMechanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
