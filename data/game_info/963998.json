The objective of the game is to defeat the devil in a deck building battle as fast as you can.  Of course to do that you must build a strong deck by travelling down a path to the far side of an island and along the way take out the devil's mercenary army and complete various non combatant encounters. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay 1 of 3 games on 1 of 7 randomly selected islands with different decks and different mercenary armies.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game play and user interface are deliberately uncomplicated so if your into causal play for a hour or two at a time the replayable Path To The Devil game may be for you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease note the main focus of the game is deck building so the rpg features are minimal.  The player basically moves forward along a path and triggers deck building battles, automatic pickups or prompts for non combatant encounters.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T03:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ae/3ae961b602fe0a96641e49a72e8a2010.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John McFadden"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["JAM Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
