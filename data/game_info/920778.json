With our game, it's possible!\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlay as Octocat and challenge yourself to reach the top of TREE'thub, watch out for roots: they don't want to see their beautiful tree damaged by the tentacles of this creature and will send you bugs to prevent your ascent. They have 3 hearts, if it falls to 0 it's a game over: he disintegrates on the spot. If they succeed, they will have conquered great GitHub and all its bugs.\r\n\r\nRULES OF THE GAME :\r\n\r\nThe enemies are small colored entities that are getting closer and closer to the main character, and upon contact, the cat loses one life.\r\n\r\nThe cat can counter when the enemies enter its attack zone (symbolized by an orb around it). To attack, the player will have to press the right keys at the right time, so if the enemy is yellow the player will have to hit \"fetch\" which corresponds to \"D\".\r\n\r\nIf the player presses a key that does not correspond to an enemy in its \"counter\" zone, he loses one life.\r\n\r\n\n\n<br/>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meet the team\r\nThanks for playing !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56aa50672ab28d116e22e236d9fb86e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NolwennA"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
