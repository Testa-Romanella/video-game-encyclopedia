In Solar Panel Panic, you are a small robot named Essey trying to generate solar power to the Main Battery and defeat Coal Bots.</p>\n\n<p>Move around the screen with WASD, use the Space Bar to begin building the various Solar Panels around the map, and press ESC to exit the game.\u00a0 With each completely built Solar Panel, the rate of charge will increase for the Main Battery. Try to complete the level as quickly as possible!<br/><br/>As this game is a prototype, a lot of features aren't yet implemented. I\u00a0do not yet have\u00a0 enemy logic in place for the Coal Bots, just an inoperable placeholder on the first level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T05:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24f/24fbef1d8b07685ce9cb0324f06ab3c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cainrodgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
