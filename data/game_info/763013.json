The person you play is named Lady Bridget and you click on different options to help her make decisions or to gather more information. What you choose will affect the ending that you get at the end of the day - there are 4 bad endings and one good one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that it's not 100% historically accurate, but I tried to stick to the rough events. If an event is not historically accurate, it's listed in the Sources page that you can go to after you finish playing or before you start playing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No choice is \"good\" or \"bad\", because while choice A might make party A happy, choice B will make party B happy.\u00a0The trick to getting a good ending is to not lean any direction and try to be fair to everyone.</p>\n<p>You can comment any bugs you find underneath in the comments section.</p>\n<p>This took around 5 hours to make.\u00a0\u00a0Updates may come periodically afterwards.</p><p>Contact me on twitter @maybeclary or go to\u00a0maybeclary.carrd.co\u00a0if you have any questions :)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>First started developing on 31 March 2022.</p>\n<p>First release date 1 April 2022.</p>\n<p>The IFID of the game is\u00a02990388C-63CB-4409-AF2C-FBBABFD40A15.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T19:46:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/6996ef77ad2e88bf00ae0a376cd67bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clary"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
