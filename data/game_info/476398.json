AND I HAVE THE PROPER LICENSE FOR THIS GAME ASSET OR PACK!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHello Guys,\r\nI am Gamedev Roguestar,\u00a0\r\nAnd I am\u00a0a 11 year old living in Assam, India;\u00a0\r\nAnd I am here with my first game,\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBOTS INVASION - The ending is the starting\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"WHERE AM I? WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PLANET? DID WE WIN? DID THE BOTS GO AWAY?\"\u00a0SneaX asked himself after he woke up from being injured during the fight between them(the aliens) and the bots!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBut he finds out that no one survived, except for him\u00a0and the bots took over his planet!! So now it's his turn to save his planet!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo now, are you ready to play as and for SneaX to save his planet? I hope yes;\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnd if yes, well be ready with your guns(shotgun, blaster and a machine gun; machine gun by default, you have to collect the others as a pickup!!) and a jetpack(to fly and kill the bots)!! And player's max health = 100!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere are two kinds of bots - Dengelbot(the bot that floats and comes towards you to kill you, most of them have only max health = 100, but one has max health = 300!!) and the other bot is\u00a0Zeyroxbot(these bots that stay in one place and attack, but they are very powerful, their max health = 400!!) So, you have to kill these bots!! Not that hard, I guess!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAnd oh! do you know that there is no navigation to any room, so you can go to any room, where you want to go!! all rooms have bots except for one room, i.e. called Loot Room(where you get all pickups, including guns, jetpack and health!!) so I hope you find the Loot Room!! And by the way every room has some pickups(any of them!!) So navigate yourself, but you can find the location of bots on the map type thing on top of screen(plz tel the name of this thing as I don't know it's name, plz tell it's name if you know in the comments!!)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo, I hope you win the game!! And best of luck!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegards\r\nYours Sincerely\r\nGamedev Roguestar\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d6f41337703fa683e6a8a073d7cfce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roguestar"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
