Choose your favorite stickman (or stick person to be politically correct), and fly through the different cities. Throw your rope from building to building and swing as far as you can. Be careful not to hit the ground or your game will be over.<br/><br/>Grab on to the objects frying through the game, such as birds, planes and helicopters.  Be warned though, one or more of these may bring you in the wrong direction and if you stay on too long, you both will crash!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T17:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6f2446bedbc7a57a555847549c1575.jpg", "website": "http://www.avalanchmountainapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Brian Appell"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Brian Appell"], "esrb_rating": null}
