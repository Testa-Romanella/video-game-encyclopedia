Real smarts. Cool head. Hot wheel.</p>\n<p>To know everything all at once would be pretty cool. And one night, by flipping your TV to Channel 17, you are suddenly whisked away, you and your brainmeat uploaded into another reality. This is the Channel Sevendream of your Teens. A weird place that will offer you a short-and-probably-not-very-substantial trip. But maybe you'll leave that dream knowing everything... or don't?<br/></p>\n\n<p>The scariest thing about this game is that there's probably a ton of bugs in it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>(Length: Roughly, like, one puzzle. This is not a very long game, and is meant to fool around in for a bit.)<br/><br/>(DMCA Warning Possibility for Streamers: There are two songs in here. One song is Scorpy's boosted version of the Tokyo Drift theme. Another, while not tracked specifically by Youtube in its description, is a cover. Just letting you know ahead of time. As of a new update, there is also a song in there that can DEFINITELY be caught by DMCA.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d80272c2b7de6b1bf76b8147cbb4baa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["smpletan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
