This design is about 7.5 inches in diameter. This is made with Stitch Fiddle, and as I am not a pro and this is just my hobby, it is free to download. If you like it or any other of my cross-stitch patterns, I would appreciate a tip. Thank you\u00a0and as always, the commissioner is doing a great job!</p>\n\n<p>Original Logo by Jadey on Discord.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e9ae026a02d6ca89dfbc01e8048b2b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Large Recycling Man"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
