It's quite rudimentary and basic.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a cube that can jump, double jump and dash. Up to 3 drones will spawn after every 5 seconds. These drones will fire projectiles towards the player. If the player dodges a projectile, they get a point, if they get hit by the projectile, they lose a point. The speed of the projectile gradually increases every 7 seconds after the 3 drones have been spawned. When the speed of the drone reaches the maximum speed, the ground level will turn red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game ends when the player hits the red layer or has a negative score.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/2352da392940e07ca76c9358fc2f98c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["incer7am"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
