The game\u2019s best features are its physics, game mechanics, level creator and of course \u2013 its endless supply of puns. <br/><br/>Although there are tools you need to use effectively to be successful, the true challenge lies in mastering the player character itself. From the internal playtests that I have violently forced my friends into, there is truly a difference between a new and experienced player, as a player who has mastered the game\u2019s physics will finish levels considerably faster, collect more points and die less frequently.<br/><br/>Who?Hi! My name is Anthony and I am the sole creator of this incredibly cheesy game. The game is the result of my long and unhealthy love and obsession with video games and cheese. <br/><br/>This is the first ever project that I started in Unity way back in 2015. Since then I started many other projects but never got to finish them. Finally, this year, I have decided to come back to this little cheesy platformer and apply what I learned since abandoning it. The game undertook some massive changes and looks and most importantly feels very different \u2013 and better - to what it used to be. Although it still doesn\u2019t look top notch and it\u2019s definitely not finished, after seeing the progress I made over the last couple of years I firmly believe that with some time and money I could make the game into what I ultimately want it to be.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as a broke student with little to no cheese to spend, I cannot afford to work on the game in my spare time as much as I'd like, that is why I decided to release it in EA on Steam.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/107df9e036eeaa95d473ba80cc8bc1bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Huehhh!"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Huehhh!"], "esrb_rating": null}
