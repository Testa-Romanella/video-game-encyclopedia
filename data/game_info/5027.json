Those fiendish and misshapen fools have (as far as we know) made off with your true love - and they haven't even had the good grace to leave a shred of evidence to follow. Only sweeping accusations and devastating style can save her from the fate she will (possibly) face now!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake control of the massively awesome and super sexy aristocratic demon known only as \"The Duke\" in an upwards-scrolling platformer where chasing down giant fleeing monsters is the business at hand. Build combos to unleash increasingly magnificent finishing moves on the (most\r\nlikely) guilty monsters - and impress your adoring fans.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAvailable exclusively from the PSN store, MPSMP comes with a full story mode, 6 unique stages, awesome animated cutscenes and an incredible soundtrack the Duke himself would approve of. With 24 levels of monster pounding justice, this is (probably) the best deal ever.<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
