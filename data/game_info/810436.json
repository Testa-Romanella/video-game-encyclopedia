How deep can you go?</p>\n<p>As an employee of\u00a0Gem Drilla Incorporated, you are tasked with mining and selling ores and gems. As you grow your capital, you unlock the ability to upgrade your drill and increase its fuel capacity, mining efficiency, and movement speed.</p>\n\n<p>Developed over the course of three days for\u00a0Mini Jam 109: Depths!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game engine was developed in C++ and the SFML library.\r\n</p>\n<p>This project's source code is available for viewing here!</p>\n\n<p>Your progress is automatically saved each time you visit the main menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrades</strong></p>\n<p>Fuel Capacity: The amount of fuel you start with in a run. Upgrading this will grant you more time to mine.</p>\n<p>Mining Efficiency: How quickly you mine blocks.</p>\n<p>Movement Speed: How quickly you traverse the map. Upgrading this will decrease the amount of time it takes to move between tiles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong></p>\n<p>Programming: Lukas Vaiciunas</p>\n<p>Art: Lukas Vaiciunas</p>\n<p>Music: Eric Skiff</p>\n<p>Font: Tepid Monkey Fonts</p>\n\n<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Download and run either \"Gem Drilla Inc x86 Setup.exe\" or \"Gem Drilla Inc x64 Setup.exe\", depending on your system.</li><li>You will be prompted to either install or modify Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables. If you are prompted to modify them,\u00a0 then they are already on your system and you can simply click \"Close\". However, if you are prompted to install them, please do so.\u00a0These contain Microsoft DLLs that are essential to run the game.</li><li>The Gem Drilla Inc Setup Wizard will now open. This will install/uninstall the game on your computer.</li><li>Click \"Next\"</li><li>Choose an installation folder and then click \"Next\"</li><li>Click \"Install\"</li><li>If prompted to grant the installer administrator privileges, please do so.</li><li>Click \"Finish\"</li><li>Installation is complete! You can run the game through either the shortcut on your desktop, the shortcut in your start menu, or through running \"game.exe\" in the installation folder.</li><li>In order to uninstall the game, run\u00a0either \"Gem Drilla Inc x86 Setup.exe\" or \"Gem Drilla Inc x64 Setup.exe\", depending on your system, yet again. Although you have the option to uninstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables, this is not recommended as they may be used by other applications. This time, the Gem Drilla Inc Setup Wizard will ask you whether you want to uninstall the game.</li></ol>\n\n<p>Note: During installation, some overenthusiastic anti-viruses may warn of suspicious activity. These kinds of false positives commonly pop up in applications that have not been run by many people, and are therefore not inherently \"trusted\". If you are skeptical, you can view the game's source code here.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you decide to mess with the save file and you accidentally corrupt your save, a new one will be created if you delete it and launch the game. This may also be done to reset your progress, if desired.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29b/29b8c0a682a15f086f857c93e922b586.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lukas Vaiciunas"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
