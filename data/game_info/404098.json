There's no inherent goal in the game. It's a simulated combat sandbox in which you're thrown in to come up with your own goals and stories. I might continue developing the game further if I feel like it, fixing bugs and optimizing, I even have ideas for some future features, but we'll see.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c3/4c34c627668d356ce7806bea8b95bcf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Z.agge"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
