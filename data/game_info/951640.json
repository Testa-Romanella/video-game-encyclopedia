It is pitch black, save for the periodic light fixtures at most corners and some long stretches. There is something in the maze, searching relentlessly for you and dedicated to killing you.</p>\n<p>If you can evade it for long enough, and keep your bearings to enough of a degree that you can locate the button that will unlock the escape vault, you will pass on to safer parts unknown.</p>\n<p>Inspired by A Really Dark Maze by Miziziziz.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There currently is no Mac version, as I don't have a Mac computer and thus building it in Unity wouldn't auto-generate the correct permissions for the file. I will add a functional Mac version as soon as I can get my hands on the right computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T22:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7b316d59f1442faffb9bbaf86173819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Rooney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
