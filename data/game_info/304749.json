But once you learn how to go fast properly, and start saving some money, you can make your car faster. Rinse and repeat until you\u2019re sitting on a throne of pizza boxes, and then you will be crowned the all-mighty king of pizza delivery.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Use the arrow keys to accelerate and steer.
