{"id": 462431, "slug": "roads-of-rage", "name": "Roads of Rage", "name_original": "Roads of Rage", "description": "<p>Roads of Rage is a 2D\u00a0arcade battle racing game where the player must race against opponents while fighting them, either by colliding with them or by the abilities provided to the player. These are obtained through PickUps around the map, but \u00a0the player has a unique ability that allows him to control the terrain, creating roadblocks for\u00a0his enemies, and if he's not careful, himself.</p>\n<p>Currently the game only has the time-trial mode implemented, where the player races against the clock as his score is reduced the longer his race takes. He can offset this by picking up cash, that will increase his score. Beware however, as you no longer have the ability to control the barriers, and they randomly activate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/261bcde588bba129b1ad97731c272959.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Purple Fox Studio"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
