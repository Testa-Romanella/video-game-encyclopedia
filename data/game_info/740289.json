Randomly generated Dungeons and Equipment<br/>2. 3 Classes to play, each with unique skills<br/>3. Diablo/MOBA style gameplay<br/>4. Character stat and weapon customization<br/><br/>As a note, there are \"Crystals\" you use to apply custom stats or features to your weapons and armor, although the the stat ones (STR+, or Power, etc) are obvious, there are a couple that might be a bit harder to figure out, here's a list:<br/><br/><br/>Teleport: Uses instant teleport instead of Dash.<br/>Healthy: Health Regen speed +1%<br/>Active: Energy Regen speed +2%<br/>Immovable: Can't be knocked back<br/>Reach: Attack hit radius +10%<br/>Concentration: Attack duration +20%<br/>Accurate: Projectile speed +20%<br/>Invulnerable: When Dashing can't be damaged<br/>Master: 10%/per point of blocked damage isn't blocked<br/>Swift: Slow effects don't affect you<br/>Acuity: Slow time effect is 10% slower<br/>Resilient: Poison effects are reduced for each point<br/>Deadly: Increase duration of the poison by 0.5s per point<br/>Dash: How far a Dash takes you, +1 for each point<br/>Focused: Can't be interrupted while casting<br/>Athlete: Increases move speed by 0.5 per point</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/193/193b44dcd26c4a452e10dd029d167d5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
