My own way of recording some of my favorite moments of the past few seasons of Blaseball.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Estimated playtime: 5-10 minutes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some Background Lore:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>On season 6, day 31\u00a0Caligula Lotus of the Boston Flowers was incinerated. Normally, when a Blaseball player is incinerated they are considered dead and removed from play.\u00a0The Flowers wouldn't accept that. Instead Cali's remains were planted in their home stadium, The Garden, where she merged with the garden, becoming a caretaker for the team. In this game you play the role of Cali as she joins the garden and navigates the events following.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Character death, discussion of death, light body horror (plant based).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The game makes use of both sound and coloured text. The music can be\u00a0muted, and is not needed for progression. The colour of text is not important for gameplay purposes, however if you need a version of the game without the use of colour please contact me and I'll upload a version.</p>\n<p>In general I\u00a0will try make an edited copy available with any given accessibility feature added on request.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Some browsers may cause issues with overly strict cookie blocking.
