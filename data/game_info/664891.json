From weapons you have a machine gun, which has a high rate of fire, but with less damage and explosive shells, which are slower in rate of fire, but with high damage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn modern mode, you control a modern fighter and fight in the air with the same. From weapons you have a machine gun and two types of missiles. The first type of missiles has ammunition capacity limited to two pieces, but they have high damage and high aiming accuracy. The second type of missiles has a limited ammunition capacity of ten, but they have less damage and low targeting accuracy. You also have heat traps to trick the missiles flying at you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn invasion mode, you fight against space invaders in a modern fighter. Here you will not have to fight against the exterminators, because you have one goal - to expel the invaders.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll modes are endless, but how long you can hold out and how many points to score for destroying enemies depends only on you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T02:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e0610c48a4016ad8600d5790dae9ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beans rolls"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["beans rolls"], "esrb_rating": null}
