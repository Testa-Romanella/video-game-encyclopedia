Every level is meticulously designed to leave the player with strong emotions known to produce vocal patterns usually unsafe for the workplace and/or small children. While these levels may often challenge your thumb dexterity, they also will challenge your mind while discovering the most efficient method of traversing each map. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c3904e87cde9d1394cccb14a87632f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["action cancel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
