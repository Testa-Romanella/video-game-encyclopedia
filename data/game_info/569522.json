You have some doors you can open, but don't expect to enter a room and just pick up just a few\u00a0objects and inspect them to see how well i can model in 3D.</p>\n<p>At first you will notice a \"TV\" on the wall. In the final game you will be guided by those TV's placed around the map, the rest is up to you to explore. As i mentioned this is not just an exploration game. You can't lose, but you can't win either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is just a game to have fun with.</p>\n<p>Have a good one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbdb16ba334fce3d101e55eea3809942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Visionary Prototype Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
