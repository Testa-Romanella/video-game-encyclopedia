{"id": 801407, "slug": "mosa-lina", "name": "Mosa Lina", "name_original": "Mosa Lina", "description": "<h3>A Hostile Interpretation Of Immersive Sim Design</h3>This game is a response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game. In order to counter this \"Lock and Key\" philosophy, Mosa Lina is aggressively random. <br/><br/>(Quick note: This does NOT mean that the game has proc-gen. Tools and Levels are handmade, they are just randomly selected and sometimes slightly modified! Nevertheless...)<br/><br/>It's literally impossible for me to check if all levels are beatable with all combinations of tools. This is what makes it so satisfying: There is no premeditated solution for you to follow. You're forced to get creative. <br/><br/>The game continually spits out randomised problems. It's up to YOU to solve them, because I've never seen them before.<br/><br/><strong>Mosa Lina releases in 2023! Not 2024! 2023!</strong><h3>True Random</h3>There are no safeguards here. You might get the same item ten times in a row. You might beat the game without seeing it at all. Every playthrough contains only a fraction of the total levels. They're also selected randomly. Nobody knows what'll happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It's this reckless abandon of predictability that allows you to stop worrying about \"winning\" and frees you to enjoy the experimentation. Fun things happen more often if you don't force them.<br/><br/><strong>Wishlist now to stay informed about the upcoming Demo &amp; release date!</strong><h3>Physics-driven-puzzle-platforming</h3>The player, tiles, items and obstacles are all parsed through the same physics-engine. Everything interacts with everything else, allowing you to get really creative and expressive.Sure, all you do is collect coins to open the portal, but HOW you do that is up to you entirely. <br/><br/><br/>So far, every playtest has shown me that even the most straighforward design is powerless against the endless creativity of players. I sometimes discover new emergent behaviours myself, even after months and months of playtesting.<h3>Modules, modules modules</h3>Since everything in Mosa Lina is built on randomly selecting content from a pool of options, it's fairly easy to add new levels, tools and challenges down the line. I've had to cut a lot of things for scope and am looking forward to adding them back in post-release. <br/><br/>There's some really, really, really wonky stuff I'm looking forward to getting back to!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for checking out our steampage!
