YOU GUYS ASKED FOR THIS.</strong><br/></p><p>Hey, thanks for checking out the project. <em>/r/furry the visual novel </em>is a parody visual novel created in renpy during a livestream, to illustrate how easy it is for someone to create a furry visual novel. I believe every visual novel needs something to set it apart from the rest as they require zero programming knowledge.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this atrocity parody for free. You can donate if you want, I guess, but please don't. I'll feel terrible, this thing is trash!</p><p>Im working on a video from the livestream &lt;3</p><p>Love - /u/neonthewolf</p><p>Telegram: @YukiLlaveneres</p><p>https://redd.it/5uhms4<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc1acb337499afe57de6797541082385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["neonthewolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
