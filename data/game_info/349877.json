How to reach the end of this \"line\" much more alive than it seems ...<br/><br/><strong>A reflection on the world for gamers who want to see further...!</strong><br/>Behind an apparent simplicity lies a solid scenario, comparing the ideas, the point of views and criticisms of a Greek philosopher about his area (8th century BC), and the various abuses of our contemporary world with its socio-political-economic crises. Which shows there\u2019s nothing new under the sun ... or almost ! But that's another story ...<br/>A \"lore\" filled with metaphors, mysteries and discoveries.<br/><br/><br/>An unknown entity sends you to look for the bars of infinity scattered in the different Empires.<br/>The only way for PhilGood to find his loved ones is to accept the challenge and follow the instructions given by this entity.<br/>Fight every enemy, solve every riddle in order to overcome obstacles and get a little closer to the \u201ctruth\u201d.<br/>But at every moment, your life hangs by a thread !<br/><br/><br/>Its various gameplay requires reflection, skills, a fighting spirit, water and breath savings, speed and restraint to find clues and hidden messages, and to decode and solve the puzzles.<br/><br/>Another particularity of the game is the system of life reconstruction, especially resurrection in a parallel world, always well linked to the scenario. A system that allows the player never to be blocked while giving more variety.<br/><br/>And a special mention for the original, interesting and even suprising soundtrack\u00a0!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-03T12:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7ff9894edf76fc8ddbd7a9a00c1d40f.jpg", "website": "https://www.philgoodgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phil Bod"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Bodgamestudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
