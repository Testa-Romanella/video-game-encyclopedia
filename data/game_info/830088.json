Use all your talent to pass through meteor fields or find your way out from a giant asteroid. None of the levels are impossible, everything depends on your talent! Keep an eye on your lights and once you passed a level, ask yourself: \"Can I be faster?\"<br/>\r\nUse left and right arrows to turn your rocket, and give a boost with the up arrow. You can shoot projectiles with the spacebar, but you can destroy only the golden rocks and meteorites. <br/>\r\nYour score is based on your speed, your accidents, and destroyed meteorites.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T04:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/425b5d0c00209bedc62c1f3e2e3703b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tamas Fofai", "Kobold GameDev."], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tamas Fofai", "Kobold GameDev."], "esrb_rating": null}
