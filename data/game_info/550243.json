Stack your bodies to create platforms, sacrifice yourself so next time you can jump across that spike pit.</p><p>Before you respawn, your soul escapes and can move around and see routes that are hidden from mortal eyes. Try to get it back - you can reclaim part of what you lose with every death...<br/></p>\n<p>Made for #AGJ2021.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD/arrows to move.</p>\n<p>Space to jump.</p>\n<p>Press F to Pay Respects<strong> ???<br/></strong></p>\r\nBy 'Lost in the Sauce Code'\r\n\n<p><strong>Ben Drake</strong> - Level Design, Programming, Story<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Nairn</strong> - Level Design, Programming, Story<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Harry Petch </strong>- Lead Programming<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jaime Williams</strong> - Lead Art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:00:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/939b11cc7efdc19b564204c288846819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry", "pxthella", "benjaminnairn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
