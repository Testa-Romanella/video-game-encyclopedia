The players main aim is to keep their colony alive while expanding your base. <br/><br/>The player can control everything a villager does in WizardCraft Colonies, from the time they sleep and work, to what potions and weapons they should carry. It's also possible to set which different jobs each villager should do. To expand your base you will need plenty of coin. There are many ways to earn coin, you could either sell gathered resources, sell crops and fruit or raise cattle. In addition your villagers will pay a daily tax for living in your colony. Players can also manually control any villager, equip a weapon, and then visit new random generated lands to defeat enemies and gather coin.<br/><br/><strong>Some Key Features Include:</strong><br/><br/><strong>An army marches on its stomach</strong> - To keep your villagers fed crops can be grown, these must be grown during the right season to optimize growth. In addition, food can be cooked. Cooked food will satisfy more hunger and will provide a happiness boost.<br/><br/><strong>Its thirsty work </strong>- Before you can grow crops you will need ample amounts of water, this can be sourced from a well or a nearby lake. Your villagers and cattle will also need to be kept hydrated if they are too carry on working.<br/><br/><strong>Weather </strong>- In WizardCraft Colonies it will rain or even snow at certain times. When it rains all crops are instantly watered reducing the workload for your villagers. In swampy regions it will rain a lot more than it does in a desert region.<br/><br/><strong>Cattle</strong> - Another way to feed your villagers is by raising cattle. Cattle can be slaughtered for meat, milked for milk or lay eggs. Cattle will also mate and produce offspring and can be a good source of coin.<br/><br/><strong>Powering your base</strong> - As your base expands you will need manatricity (WizardCraft Colonies version of electricity). There are many ways to produce manatricity, either with solar panels, wind turbines or by burning coal. Each has their own benefits and drawbacks E.G (solar panels will only work at night, wind turbines only work while its windy and coal generators produce pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Pets</strong> - Some of the critters in WizardCraft Colonies may eat your crops or raid your stockpiles for food. To keep them under control you can have pets around your base. Pets can be named but you must also meet their basic needs by feeding them and giving them water.<br/><br/><strong>Seasons </strong>- There are four seasons in WizardCraft Colonies, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The seasons will affect how well certain crops will grow, also fruit trees will only produce fruit in a specific season. In winter you must protect your crops from the cold by placing greenhouses above them. In winter it is also possible to walk over lakes as they become frozen.<br/><br/><strong>Keeping Warm/Cool</strong> -  Winter can be a tough season for your colony, to keep them warm you will have to provide sources of heat around your base. In Summer, especially in desert regions your colony might become too hot, so you will need cooling towers to keep them cool. If a villager becomes too hot or cold they will slowly lose health and could die.<br/><br/><strong>Happiness</strong> - Everyone knows that a happy villager is the most productive villager, so to keep your colony happy you can place furniture around your base and provide them with cooked food or beer. For the younger villagers you can place toys for them to play with.<br/><br/><strong>A new generation</strong> - It is possible for your colony to have children, who will grow up and work in your base. Additionally villagers will also get old and die as time passes by.<br/><br/><strong>Staying alive</strong> - From time to time your base may come under attack by grizzly bears or monsters.
