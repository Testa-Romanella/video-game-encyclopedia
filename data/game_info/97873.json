So I went and fixed that.<br/>Nothing new has been added.</p>\n<p>Version 2.3 was made because the Pukis worst ending had no music playing. (Re-used a bgm to fix that.) This should HOPEFULLY by the final build.<br/>Nothing new has been added.</p>\n<p>Version 2.4 was made because a couple errors popped up in 2.3, making 1-2 paths \"unplayable/unreadable\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/8281f4a6405cfda135f2c9cb1fb8ec8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sunlit-Dreamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
