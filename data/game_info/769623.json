Our game takes place in Croquette, a dainty little English village nestled deep in the Mallet mountains full of citizens who love nothing more than a good round of lawn sports. To play croquet, simply knock both blue and red croquet balls through the designated wickets on each course to complete each level. Strategically roquet your croquet balls by knocking them together to reduce your stroke count along the way. As with any perfect simulation, Croquet Simulator VR is not without its unexpected lifelike hazards: beware feral chickens and gravity wells as you line up your perfect shot down the pitch.<br/></p><p><strong>This project requires a VR Headset and Controllers!\u00a0</strong>If you run into any issues running this project on your headset, let us know which device you are using in the comments below and we'll try to rectify it!
