It may seem that except for his name, his life is nothing exceptional. That is if it wasn\u2019t for a chain of events that fluctuate between his daily routine and an existential terror of reiteration. What is the most important part? It\u2019s you and You facing inevitability.<br />\nThis is you, and this \u2013 is You. Both of you have something in common \u2013 exceptionality in a monotonous moment of time, when meaningless decisions have to be made. Or meaningful, to such an extent, that there is nothing left once they are made. Who knows what awaits you around the corner \u2013 will you go to work in a continuous, &#39;almost-holiday&#39; fever or wander in a labyrinth of crooked mirrors? Except for his name, it seems our character\u2019s life is nothing more than unexceptional \u2013 there\u2019s no room for miracles or cobwebs. The room is filled with office papers, some vaguely familiar family members, an ailing story of sensation, a couple of dropped lines and a sharp drop \u2013 a circle, inside and outside of which you and You wander. Open the letter, pick up the phone, speak up or step aside \u2013 and this story will gain new fractures and reflections.<br />\nFeatures:<br />\nUnique atmosphere and visual art that fully convey the gloomy mood of the novel<br />\nMore than 10 alternative endings<br />\nSpecial soundtrack for each finale<br />\nOffbeat structure of the plot: the full story can be put together, only if a player lives through every possible situation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T20:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/dda7d5c39fa3df6e55620166002f0704.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 127, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 28, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nikita Kaf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nikita Kaf"], "esrb_rating": null}
