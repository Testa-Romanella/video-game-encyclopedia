Lets just get that out of the way right now.<br/><br/>But what (I think, at least) makes this project unique is that I'm not some game studio cashing in on the fact that YouTube and esports are massively popular [not to name anyone in particular\u00a0:)] but instead I am someone who plays esports titles myself.\u00a0 3,750 hours in Dota 2, 1,186 hours in Rocket League, and a few other games that have a 100 or so hours dotted around my steam library. Not only do I play these games myself and have an understand for what makes them tick, but I also watch them avidly at the professional level (Admittedly Dota 2 more than the others by a large margin) so I also have an interest in what goes on at the higher levels concerning roster swaps and role changes and the sort.</p>\n<p>This project is a reflection of that. While, yes, I am substituting complex human thinking with Random Number Generators and a few algorithms, the goal of the entire project is to make something that feels likes its own little world that you can actually get invested in. Follow a player or team through their journey (Or in the future, run one.)</p>\n<p>Now that the description is out of the way, the roadmap (Which WILL NOT be followed in order, I get sidetracked easily.)</p>\n<ul><li>Implement discrete load and save functions, and allow those to load and save multiple different games</li><li>Add in cheese strats</li><li>Add \"Time\" so in the future we can do roster swaps post TI</li><li>Hovering over a team in the tournament\u00a0 bracket will highlight their path through the tournaments</li><li>Make the tournament bracket itself easier to follow</li><li>Clicking on a player from any of the \"View top 10 player\" modes or view team modes\u00a0(and teams in the \"View top 10 player\" and view player modes\u00a0) takes you to that appropriate player (or team)</li><li>Monetary system so teams have to operate under budget</li><li>Team management mode</li><li>Mid Season roster swaps</li><li>Some sort of notification to notify the player when a team has moved its roles around</li><li>Add in more \"Top 10\" modes for teams and players</li><li>Organize the buttons in a way that makes sense</li><li>Make sure all the buttons \"Contain\" their text</li><li>Add in Hotkeys for various things</li></ul>\n<p>If you can think of anything else that I am missing, please be sure to make note of it and I will be sure to communicate whether or not I already had a plan\u00a0(that I didn't mention above, because I forget things) or if I can think up an alternate solution that might be better (assuming I haven't already implemented your idea, because that tends to be the first thing I focus on)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9cebf328bf09baafcf5765affdf568a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eleventy49"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
