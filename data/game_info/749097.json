You will select some blocks to make a district, whatever is the majority color in the district wins that district. You will try and make it where a majority of the districts are the color the game tells you. If you do this then you win that level. Press the Done button to submit your districts and go to the next level. This is also my first game jam and I did not have any audio because I did not want to use royalty-free music and I could not make anything good.</p><p>Created in one day btw because I did not have time for a whole week.<br/></p>\n<p>Github: https://github.com/AMTitan/Gerrymandering<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:37:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AMTitan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
