You can create any type of visual look, many weather conditions or any color change without losing quality.<br/><br/>Greatly optimized master materials with tons of customization options. We are very proud of our RGB mask basecolor system which is surprizingly easy to create with our up-coming editor utility \"RGB Wizard\" to convert any basecolor map to rgb mask.<br/><br/><strong>We made this demo like we produce our games so it is not a simple showcase demo. We used many marketplace products and combined them with VT_environment to show that \"Game Ready\" tag is real and also to show that our screenshots on the marketplace page and our showcase video is gameplay shots. You are paying for what you see and you will get what you see. We know it is normal to show off the best version of an image but we feel more comfortable this way because we belive your time is precious and you shouldn't waste too much time on assets you bought rather then improve your game by adjusting some parameters in our pack.<br/><br/></strong><em>We hope to make you get excited and dive into imagination of what can you achieve if you were using our VT_Environment pack!<br/><br/></em><strong>UE4 Marketplace link to VT_Environment</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b5fb66a6ab78bdf6a01ae9554cfa68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mythra Tech"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
