Though, that might end up changing after this session...</em>\"</p>\n<p>You play as a therapist/psychology student at a walk-in therapy clinic on a slow day when there are no clients, no coworkers, and not even a janitor to chat with. Well, at least it's a slow day until a HUGE group of people walk in for a group therapy session. (About ten, plus one computer... box... thing.)</p>\n<p>(... you still can't tell what that thing is.)</p>\n<p>After a series of introductions (Romeo, Mevia, Hadrian, the Warden that's not a name but okay\u00a0, Aiden, Cassie Rose, Stella, Jesse, Ivor,\u00a0Harper, and PAMA\u00a0seriously, is this thing a box or a computer or what), you're immediately launched into what will soon become the weirdest group therapy session ever.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:\u00a0</strong>Full version released!!
