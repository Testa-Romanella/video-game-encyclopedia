Take your last passenger home before night-time arrives.\"</p>\n<p>A very short meditative experience where you drive a Jeepney through a Filipino barrio.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I used the awesome Darkbringer shader from the Unity Asset Store (Link).</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>My main aim was to experiment with abstraction in both visuals and narrative. I'm fascinated by what can result from pushing detailed\u00a03D assets into crunchy pixels. I didn't get a chance to implement a proper 64x64 menu and credit screens and would have loved to expand on the story and interaction more. Thoroughly enjoyed putting this one together though. Many thanks to the LowRezJam hosts and looking forward to playing everyone's games! Cheers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/8531186cd45aa41bc8962f6b6bdbe8cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hello-st"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
