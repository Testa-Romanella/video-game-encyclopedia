In the middle of the war, you fall in battle to an enemy knight who beheads you. When you wake up, miraculously healed, you realize what a difficult\u00a0situation you've gotten yourself into. You decide to talk to your friends and find out exactly what could be so terribly wrong with dying over, and over, and over again. You can come back, can't you?</em></p>\n<p>When death is (relatively) easy to survive, it does somethings to you. Creates new problems, makes some problems worse, worries your friends and family... so on and so forth.\u00a0In this short visual novel, play as a semi-immortal character whose repeated deaths have started to worry his friends, despite being unconcerned with it himself.</p>\n<p>Please check the content warnings (accessible from the game's main menu) before playing.<br/></p>\n<p>Submitted to the\u00a0I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again) Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a115c29a1de5623e3e36c7212de719a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ghostchibi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
