That&#39;s the essence of OFDP2, the world&#39;s fastest brawler.  It features the original OFDP&#39;s unique two-button mechanics which we&#39;ve spent the last five years perfecting.  Speed and precision are key in this whirlwind fighting frenzy, as players maintain control over the 26 different unlockable skills, frenetic gameplay, and classic kung fu-inspired animations.ATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT<br />\nWe want to show that a fighting game can be complex without cumbersome button combinations.  Once players complete the tutorial levels and learn the basics, they&#39;ll see that this is the most intense two-button game ever made.<br />\nWith a 1000 different animations available, literally, anything is possible\u2014particularly when players unlock each of the 26 available skills.  Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve.   Seeing the game with all 26 skills is a spectacle unique to OFDP2.<br />\nWe built this game as a palette cleanser between other games in your library.  It was designed to deliver a quick hit of adrenalin as fast as possible.<br />\nYou can&#39;t get a feel for the gameplay from watching videos.  The flow of combat is something we spent years tweaking.  It&#39;s what makes OFDP2 unique.  Only by playing it will this become clear.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to us that you TRY THE DEMO out before you consider purchasing this game.EASY TO LEARN<br />\nTHE WORLD&#39;S FASTEST BRAWLER<br />\nOUR ONLY GOAL WAS TO CREATE FUN<br />\n400+ LEVELS - 26 SKILLS - 4 ENDLESS SURVIVAL TOWERS</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-05T14:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4fe/4fe61ecd27bb128b3354453dd1a891a7.jpg", "website": "https://www.ofdp2.com/", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 531, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 18, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 844, "ratings_count": 49, "suggestions_count": 493, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 51, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Silver Dollar Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silver Dollar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
