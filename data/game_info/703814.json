But you can collect soul energy to boost up your stats and unlock new\u00a0spells!</p>\n<p>I really put every spare second into this project over the last few days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I hope you've fun with that prototype game.</p>\n\n<p>Controls are explained in the tutorial.</p>\n<p>Press ESC for the controls if you are in a Level.</p>\n\n<p>PS: If you play it in the browser and your character won't move at the beginning\u00a0- Click in the game with your mouse and use your scrollbar. I don't why but that helps right now.\u00a0Please be careful not to click outside the game when shooting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e16d155d05cf9d10636dc46dfe852cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SilvanuZ"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
