{"id": 817073, "slug": "tenebra", "name": "Tenebra", "name_original": "Tenebra", "description": "<p>Tenebra is an atmospheric puzzle game with rogue-like elements. Guide the hapless protagonist to the exit,\u00a0but also keep in mind that he is afraid of darkness and refuses to walk in the dark areas.</p>\n<p>Move torches around, push lights on rails, find keys to doors, light up cold braziers, pass through archways that\u00a0collapse behind you, find oil barrels to make your torches brighter, squeeze through cracks in broken walls, fix\u00a0broken rails with a hammer, illuminate the sensors to open the exits... do whatever it takes to get out of there!</p>\n<p>This is a PC port of my popular Commodore 64 game. I have tried to recreate the retro feel of the old 8-bit machine.</p>\n<p>The free demo version contains the first 8 of 31 levels.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Movement\u00a0 : WASD / Cursor Keys / Joystick D-Pad</li><li>\u00a0Action\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0: Space / Left Control / Joystick A</li><li>\u00a0Menu\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0: Esc / Joystick Start</li><li>\u00a0Screenshot : F12</li></ul>\n<p>Progress is saved at the beginning of each level.</p>\n<p>Press \"Q\" at any time to immediately quit to desktop.</p>\r\nRequirements:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0OS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li>Windows 10 64bit or newer (older versions might work)</li><li>Ubuntu-based 18.04 64bit or newer (older versions or other flavours might work)</li><li>MacOS Mojave (10.14) or newer</li></ul></li><li>\u00a0Graphics\u00a0\u00a0<ul><li>OpenGL-capable graphics card (Intel integrated graphics supported)</li><li>Minimum display size of 1536x960</li></ul></li><li>\u00a0Disk space: ~10MB</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T10:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db32d3d086441f9bef5c0907a41d1be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Haplo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
