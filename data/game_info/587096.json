Explore open 3D environments and tackle tough challenges at your own pace... all while keeping\u00a0\u00a0your baby alive. Or let him die - the choice is yours.<br/></p>\n<p>You can follow this game on Twitteror Discord.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will be updating this game as often as I can to adjust difficulty and accessibility\u00a0based on player feedback. Thank you to everyone for the responses so far!</p>\n<p>Note that save data should be sharable between versions 0.01-0.03 because no changes concerning any save data have been made yet.</p>\n<p>This demo includes the first level of the game and showcases features such as voice-acted cutscenes, unique enemies, NPCs, and death animations, and\u00a0unlockable skins that can be used in New Game Plus for added replay value.</p>\n<p>Contains mild swearing, cartoonish blood and violence, and the most important feature of all, a DEDICATED BREASTFEEDING BUTTON which allows you to BREASTFEED at ANY TIME. See that baby? You can breastfeed it. (<em>Breastfeeding is censored by default but can be uncensored from the options menu</em>).</p>\n<p>All feedback is appreciated. Made with Unreal Engine 4. Retro visual effects were achieved using PSXFX by Marcis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A controller is recommended for this game.
