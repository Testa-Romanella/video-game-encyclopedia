I also worked alone. I couldn't really finish the game. The Game is a casual game which is meant to be a bit difficult. it has two modes. (Note: there might be some bugs, if you encounter any try restarting your game). Thanks for playing!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made with Unity.</p>\n<p>The game is about two player who have individual powers and they can use it individually( one is for defense and one is for attack) but they also have the power to fuse with each other and become one which grants them the ability to use both powers as one individual. The fusion state comes with great power but it doesn't last forever, they always have to return to their individual selves for a while before they can enter the state again.</p>\n<p>***If you get hit by the enemies twice, you die and the enemies also die if they get hit by you twice.\u00a0One of the players has a defense ability and the other has an attack ability, depending on who you are controlling, you can use either of these powers. but during the fused state, you can use both powers simultaneously by pressing the corresponding buttons.***</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVES :</p>\n<p>For Platformer Mode \u00a0;\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. You have to reach the end of the platform before the timer( 2 minutes) runs out, to complete the level( its advisable to start with the this game Mode so as to get familiar with controls). If you reach the end, your remaining time and number of kills show up as your score, if you die or timer runs out, you are taken to a game over screen.</p>\n<p>For Survival Mode ;</p>\n<p>1. Just survive as long as you can. (Note : This is an hardcore mode and also, ignore the timer, I forgot to take it out. only the kills count as your score)</p>\n<p>The controls pop up immediately when you open the game(I forgot to disable it lol). which is a good way to understand the controls at first sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS :</p>\n<p>1. \"A\" and \"D\" for movement respectively\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. \"Q\" and \"E\" for Switching between the two players</p>\n<p>3. \"F\"\u00a0to fuse players when they are close to each other( Note : During Fusion your stats are increased, like; RunSpeed, AttackRate, JumpHeight and so on. But there is a countdown timer for the Fusion state and after breaking up there is a cool down before you can fuse again)</p>\n<p>4. \"G\" to break up the fusion of your own will.</p>\n<p>5. \"Spacebar\" to Jump (Fusion state has more Jump Height). Tap the \"Spacebar\"\u00a0for Low Jump and hold it for High Jump</p>\n<p>6. \"Left\" and \"Right\" Mouse Button. When you are not Fused the players have individual powers which is binded to the \"left\" mouse button. but when your are in the fused state, both powers are binded to the \"Left\" and \"Right\" mouse buttons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d772b2c8bbccf9fc6c5a1d2704d6c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreatOT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
