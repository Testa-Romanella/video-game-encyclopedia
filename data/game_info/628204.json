Venture into a terraforming planet, rich in resources and dangers. On Mars, the rider's life is difficult, lonely and hostile. Protect your cargo. Deliver as fast as you can and maybe you'll survive.<br/></p>\r\nYour delivery round begins\r\n<p>Aboard your bike accept delivery orders at the central hub and venture into the beautiful Martian moors. Deliver supplies to the most remote outposts and escape from thieves who will try to steal your cargo. If you get in a bad mood, rent a battle drone for your safety.</p>\r\nChoose the right route\r\n<p>Mars' terrain is rugged and uneven, full of creeks, depressions and mountains. Choose the right route so the bike doesn't tilt too much or you'll lose your cargo. Remember: a half delivery means half pay.</p>\r\nTake care of your equipment\r\n<p>Take care of your cargo but most of all your equipment. Recharge your bike at charging stations or using the emergency solar panel. If your suit gets damaged you will quickly lose oxygen: repair it using equipment purchased at trade points Finish deliveries or collect lost packages from other employees to quickly earn credits to spend on equipment: oxygen tanks, sealant, emergency batteries and more.\u00a0</p>\r\nNew day, new deliveries\r\n<p>Return to the underground base once your deliveries are complete. Report and rest. Your new round of deliveries awaits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/122178045b601fcebe0051b70b343acd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Videolud"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
