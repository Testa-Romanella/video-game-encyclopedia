Right now it's very bare-bones, but\u00a0 I plan on adding many more features, such as a rounds system that introduce new enemies in different combinations as you run through the game. I also want to add upgrades you get between the rounds that have unique effects, along side powerful temporary powerups you pick up within a round. Oh, and sound of course, I want the rockets and their explosions to make cool techno noises, and cool music eventually.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c471ea3a703c5dbae6d61d44ecf2479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["snooperboop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
