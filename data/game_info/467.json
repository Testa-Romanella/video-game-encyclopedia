Challenging and entertaining. Not just some gem or gummy game. Terrific find!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThis is like the version of Puzzle Quest I never knew I wanted. Oodles of quests, challenges, guild activities, cool monsters, arena fights, ranked fights, and man I could just play that treasure mini game all day.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThis is gems and fee to play done right. You don't need to spend money but if you can, you will. It won't make you overpowered, but you will have fun with it. The game play is great and varied. There are tons of different options.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDifferent than other match 3 games, very fun and addicting. Keeps me entertained for hours.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThis game is FANTASTIC! I was a huge fan of the original game <br/>\"Puzzle Quest\" and this game is created by the same people. The other \"Puzzle Quest\" sequels have been disappointments and I haven't enjoyed them. This game however, has the same great game play.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cIt's refreshing to see a game without timers or stamina. I can play this game for hours without needing to wait.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThis helped cure me of candy crush.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOver the years, many games have come and gone on my phone. But this one is always there. Free. No ads. No limited-play \"lives\" (think Candy Crush). No real downside. Your standard colored-gem matching game with a wonderfully nerdy twist!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMy wife almost leave me because of this game, and it happened twice. Nuff said.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb974fe5f1dab5e02b97d5595a9e0af.jpg", "website": "http://www.gemsofwar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["505 Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["505 Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
