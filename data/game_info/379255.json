The characters are all versions of my friends and I think I have accurately presented them within this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main character is you! the player is supposed to fill in their wants and needs of themselves into this playable character.\u00a0 Through the choices you pick, I think they are diverse enough to allow you to express yourself more than you think you would be able to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The narrator and guide are Tasman, Myself! After a few choices, you don't need my help anymore, so I intentionally disappear so that you can focus on hanging out with my friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The friends are as follows: Ellise, Natalie, Josh, and Andy. In the game, you get a little character bio if you decide you want to know more about them and who they are. Ellise is a caring and quiet girl who talks at valuable moments. Her role is the voice of reason in the group. She just wants to keep everyone safe and protected. Natalie is the wild card character. you never know what's going to come out of her mouth. She craves fun and will always try to make any situation more fun by any means necessary.\u00a0 Josh is the number guy. He cares about numbers and what makes the most sense.\u00a0 Andy is a combination of the three. He is fun, logical and caring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The decision points in this story are not super in-depth but they do matter. the decisions to decide how to spend the money are very important. there are three short storylines and you get to pick the adventure you go on. Throughout the beginning of the story, you make a series of meaningless choices that kind of trick you into ultimately deciding if you live or die. But you don't know which choice will do what. I liked making the game this way because when I play it, I don't even know the outcomes or how to win.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>By choosing to know more about the characters, it will help you save time deciding who to trust when trying to pick the least problematic idea. The motive behind the decisions is to have fun, but sometimes someone's idea of fun can get you killed. As we navigate the waters of trying to please everyone but still make good choices, we conclude that regardless of the choice, you can only accomplish one of the two. By choosing not to read about the characters, you may go into the game blind to each characters motive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I came up with the beats to the story by reading a lot of short stories in my English class. I concluded that happy endings are boring and that no one wants an easy ending. Sad and disappointing ends can be way more fun! So all of my beats lead to unhappy endings. They are way more creative than the happy ones.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of writing this story was trying to end it before my dead line. It honestly could have gone on forever but sadly, all good things must come to an end. With almost 40 passages, this story essentially wrote itself. I wanted to write a story about situations that would probably happen to me and my friends if we were given $10,000. I have changed the names of all of my friends except for my own. The other challenges were just staying focused on taking the reader somewhere they were on expecting to go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted the reader to live out my wildest dreams and understand my motive more than the characters I think. I tried to give the reader very plausible options that were also very outside of the box. I also thought it would be funny to punish them for picking boring options.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/35524789fc6bf6f345698a590597f275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tasman55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
