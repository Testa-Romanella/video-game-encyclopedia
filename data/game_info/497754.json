You'll have to match the numbers up to others with the same value or with a value that will add up to 10. Further instructions are available through the help button.</p>\n<p>Play as long as you want. As soon as you're happy with your score you can post a screenshot of your score page anywhere you want.</p>\n<p>This game does not save your progress! As soon as you close it you're done. This also means that you can simply restart by restarting the game.</p>\n<p>The executable runs under windows (obviously), but it seems to run with wine as well (linux and mac).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3c/e3ca5e24212fcf5917b682428c2b02ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simmarith"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
