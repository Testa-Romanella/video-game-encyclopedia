They\u2019ll either get doubled or turn to nothing. Your objective is simply to accumulate as many points as possible. <br/><br/>It\u2019s up to you how cautious you want to play, but it\u2019s high risk reward. Points in your account are safe, but what fun is safety without progress? With only 2 controls, you must play this game on instinct alone. <br/><br/>The game is won once you reach 1 million points, and your progress towards this is shown at the bottom of the screen. You can of course keep playing even after surpassing this goal.<h3>Controls:</h3>The game was designed with a mouse in mind, but you can also play with the keyboard too:<br/><br/>Space = Press the button<br/>Arrow keys = Change deposit amount", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T03:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e84919e927ee679b6c7d61d3e2b1eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun", "TNTNT"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
