{"id": 970876, "slug": "city-breaker", "name": "City Breaker", "name_original": "City Breaker", "description": "City Breaker is a VR physics-destruction game focused around destroying large-scale physics structures like skyscrapers. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently, the game is centered around throwing blocks at buildings to knock them down. Your throws are scaled up in power depending on the block, so you're able to throw 90 pound blocks at about 400 miles per hour and watch as they rip through the side of a building and cause the entire thing to collapse. Every level is hand crafted, and as you progress, you'll begin seeing realistic physics-based rockets, skyships, turrets, and even ragdoll human-like creatures<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is in Early Access. Currently, there are several awesome features (AI-controlled skyships, for example) that aren't available because they cause a lot of lag. For example, when I built a Nuclear Reactor level and set it off, the resulting lag from the 10,000 physics collisions happening at once dropped the frame rate to around 30. That should never happen in VR, so that level and other potentially broken items are also not in the game.<br/>\r\n(The game runs great, by the way: If you have a 1080 you should never have a framerate below 144. I wanted this game to run as smoothly as Beat Saber and to a large extent, it does).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is going to get better over time. Advanced turrets, ragdolls, and AI-controlled skyships are all in the works: I just need to optimize them. There will also be two more game modes included with the next update, Rampage (infinite procedural levels) and Archery (where you shoot down buildings with explosive arrows).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T22:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e44d7c6dbdeada84dade0028535d6be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soareverix"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soareverix"], "esrb_rating": null}
