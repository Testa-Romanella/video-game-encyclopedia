Each emanating a different energy and showing off a different color.<br/>The four crystals were left in a secure place for study and analisys, but one day, a group stole them.<br/>Four wizards, blinded by power, took each one a crystal, and used it's power to unleash chaos in earth.<br/>More years have passed, and the few humans that survived are now living in shelters, little by little being decimated. <br/>But hope, shined once again, when a fifth crystal came from the heavens, with it's purple color, one last good wizard, took care of it. <br/>With the power of the crystal, Izedor, the wizard, contained the power of the other 4 evil wizards, and also, built a machine.<br/>The machinery was able to transverse through time, enabling the user to go back, in the moments before chaos began. <br/>But if Izedor left to do this quest, he might not be able to stop the evil wizards in the present time.<br/>And so... a new hero showed up in the world, one little girl, who refused to give up, and was willing to go back, and stop the chaos, before it even began.\r\n\r\nGroup Name:\u00a0Waifu x Hunters\r\nGroup members:\r\n<ul> <li><strong>Gabriel Woiciekoski:</strong>\u00a0Character Design, Level Design, Arte</li><li><strong>Guilherme Hernandes Meneghini de Britto: </strong>Character Design, Arte, Programa\u00e7\u00e3o geral</li><li><strong>Henriq</strong><strong>ue D</strong><strong>ragone:\u00a0</strong> Dire\u00e7\u00e3o do projeto</li><li><strong>Isabella de Almeida Vasques:</strong>\u00a0Character Design, Arte</li><li><strong>Rafael Meirelles:</strong> Programa\u00e7\u00e3o do Boss</li><li><strong>Vitor Augusto Hickmann Schuck:</strong>\u00a0Character Design, Arte</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\n<strong>Font:</strong>\n<p>Simple Square - BlueLithium</p>\n<strong>Music:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Main Menu</strong>:\u00a0Old Music -\u00a0Alexandr Zhelanov</li><li><strong>Intro</strong>:\u00a0Sad Budi Blues -\u00a0Lennartmusic\u00a0</li><li><strong>1-1 : Tutorial - </strong>Fantasy Music - Alandriel's Theme</li><li><strong>1-2 : Mini Boss Tutorial -</strong>\u00a0Fantasy Music - Alandriel's Theme</li><li><strong>1-3 : Boss Tutorial -\u00a0</strong>Fantasy Music - Alandriel's Theme</li><li><strong>Lobby -</strong> Ice Scream For Ice Cream -\u00a0Pro Sensory</li></ul>\n<strong>SFX:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Sword</strong>:\u00a0Knife Sharpening Slice -\u00a0Berklee samples</li><li><strong>Shield: </strong>Short impact - Soundsnap</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b50e6eba6387b467acf9a4608f9405f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["waifu-x-hunters", "Castanha", "Subexter"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
