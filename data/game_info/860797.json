I actually had a story in mind before the theme was announced but I think it fit quite\u00a0well with the theme of love as the story focuses on\u00a0self-love and\u00a0friendship.<br/><br/>The idea for this game was sparked by an idea I had for a children's book. I thought, \"What better way to test it out?\" than through this interactive medium. There are other themes I touch upon throughout the story\u00a0such as accessibility (or sadly, lack\u00a0of) as well as acceptance of oneself and others. It is a story that embraces the philosophies of\u00a0diversity, inclusion, and equity, which are all very close to my heart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T19:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/2348e936e304ff1145808a680cc9290b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sista Theta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
