Her dream of freedom is cut short by the yacht's colossal coxswain, an encounter that will change Kata's life forever. Before they know it, Kata and her unlikely companion find themselves trapped on a Jovian world, light-years away from the crowded streets of Lud Nidal, suspended above a sea of clouds by two ponderous helium pontoons. The two must find a way back to the portal through which they've come, or die when the yacht sinks into the lightning-fuelled maelstrom below. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378106490c6fa5e19af8029a6e5e64a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WaywardSky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
