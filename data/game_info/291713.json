Can this be a game if it concerns your ultimate asset? This 'game' will make you think twice. It differs from other Christian games in its quite direct approach to the essential Christian topic.</p>\n<p>\"Heaven or hell?\u201d is a Christian simulation of your soul\u2019s fate, a scorecard based on Achille Christian's understanding of the Scriptures and of Church teachings. The outcome depends on your answers to an Angel's questions and your setting of God's mercy upon you.</p>\n<p>No mortal being can know its soul\u2019s future. Only God can. But it seems wise to spend time thinking about just that.</p>\n<p>In the free and limited version you answer 15 questions (40 for a more balanced result in the full version) to get an important result: Heaven, purgatory or hell. You will always make an assumption regarding God\u2019s mercy (set to 0% by default).\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the free version you will also miss: going back to change previous answers, an explanation for your result, choice between male or female character, and showing progress during the game.\u00a0 The full version will be available somewhere in February 2019.<br/></p>\n<p>To prevent unnecessary Windows warnings from your firewall, play the game from within the app.</p>\n<p>Also available for Android.</p>\n<p>More info can be found on Achille Christian's website.</p>\n<p>For the Windows versions: Windows 7 with SP1 (and Direct X11) / Windows 8 / Windows 10. To\u00a0prevent unnecessary warnings from your firewall, play the game from within the\u00a0app, that can be installed first.</p>\n<p>For the Android versions: Android 5 to 9. Tablets OK. Android 5-7 may require a change in your security settings before downloading: allow installation from unknown sources.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25ce3ec28c327a68f5b2ec7a4fbafca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Achille Christian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
