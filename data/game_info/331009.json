As Sora stands in the crossroads, he gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends. Just then, a mysterious man approaches from down one of the branching paths. &quot;Ahead lies something you need,&quot; he says, &quot;but to claim it, you must lose something dear.&quot; The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle that eerily resembles a girl&#39;s drawing... In the coming journey, what will Sora and his companions gain, and what will they lose?
