The Theme was\u00a0<strong>Hide or Get Caught</strong>. I\u00a0made this game in 2 hours and 59 minutes. It was a fun challenge to make! I experimented with a lot of new mechanics that I have never messed with before when developing a game, so it came out not as polished as I would like, but I am happy that I made this game and did what I did during the development process because I\u00a0learned a lot! This is a game that I think would be really cool to see fleshed out and polished. Unfortunately, I had no time to focus on the art or music/sfx for this game this time around, but I feel like I have grown a lot as a game developer and designer, even since last weekend's game jam! Even though it is very rough, and definitely more of a prototype than a game, I\u00a0am very happy with the progress I\u00a0made and the fact that I actually managed to get something playable lol. I hope you all enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2c27632aaa8992b739505a5f8413d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VeryTori"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
