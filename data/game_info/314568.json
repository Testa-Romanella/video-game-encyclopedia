Our spies managed to capture her, but only the pilots with your skills will be able to take her away from the populated areas. You will certainly die ... But you can save billions of lives. Good luck! And remember \u2014 you are responsible for each other.<br/><br/>Two players must stand behind the controls of two spaceships connected by a common charge. Driving such a vehicle is not easy, because each player directs one half of the structure \u2014 even seemingly simple actions, such as turning and dodging, must be agreed on by the team members on an ongoing basis. The aim of the game is to get the highest score \u2014 points are gained by moving away from the starting screen and destroying enemy ships. We must also avoid asteroids that could damage our ship.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/350/350397c573e64bc5b6468faad3d4039c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["michal_blaszczyk", "kosa6", "bhq"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
