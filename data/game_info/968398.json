Click the girls to collect money and upgrade their services so that they can entertain the guests even more and earn more money.

Your decisions determine how much more efficiently your next company will earn money.<h3> Rules, Tasks and Achievements</h3>Complete milestones while managing your cafe and if you are looking for other challenges, accomplish the tasks and achievements that you get from the cuties.<h3>Harem of 9 Maids</h3>When you want to get intimate with one of the maids, ask them out and give them presents or fulfill tasks for them.<h3>30+ Sex Scenes</h3>Those who really deserve it get all the sweaty, naughty fun from their favorite maids.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T05:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b76706ed5e9e1d6ab35504d82a112e.jpg", "website": "https://www.woopmedia.online/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woop Media"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Woop Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
