What Ted thinks is best for Theo isn't necessarily a view shared by Teddy, however; the primal, emotional subconscious voice... <br/><br/>In the process of repairing Cortex, re-hiring a team and finding out what happened the night of the accident, Ted and Teddy must cast aside their differences and learn to work together. Headspun is a game about recovery, discovery, and the ongoing battle between logic and emotion. <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Rich FMV story-telling<br/></li><li>Branching dialogue - sway the outcome of your interactions<br/></li><li>Rebuild Cortex - earn Neuros to hire staff and commission renovations <br/></li><li>Retreive Lost Memories and work out what happened the night of Theo's accident<br/></li><li>Original Synthwave Score from Soho Loop </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T18:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b3107d668fe7674d209fb0d8d9f526cb.jpg", "website": "http://headspun.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 14, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Superstring"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wales Interactive", "Superstring"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
