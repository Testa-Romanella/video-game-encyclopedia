Fighting off thousands of zombies with only your massive cleaver and equally massive cleavage.<br/><br/>The game is played with simple arcade mechanics (move left, move right, high attack, low attack), and it starts you off with an easy amount of zombies to re-kill. But each level adds more and more zombies, and eventually dogs that will chew your face off in a couple seconds.New in the Awesome EditionFor people who play the whole game in one sitting I wanted to give them a break from the repetitiveness of hacking and slashing 2D zombies. So in the later half of the game I added new levels where you hack and slash (or shoot) 3D zombies!! Pretty brilliant right? I think so.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T00:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/2531bfa462fdb3101eb0399b3f23cc56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.5, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 190, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 451, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Awesome Enterprises"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awesome Enterprises"], "esrb_rating": null}
