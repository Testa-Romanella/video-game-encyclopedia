Do not play if you have a weak heart!<br/><br/>The premise is simple: You are a private investigator hired to look for evidence for a missing children case in the manor off the road. Once you enter, the door locks behind you. Find a way to escape the manor, or die trying.<br/><br/>The spirits of the manor want to play a game. A jack in the box will appear randomly around the house and you must find it before its music stops playing, or else...<br/><br/>A dark figure also roams the halls, avoid it at all costs.<br/><br/>There are two safe-houses where the dark figure cannot reach you, but if you are in one and the jack in the box's music stops, you will die.<br/>In the safe-houses, a camera system is present and you can use it to check where the jack in the box or spirit is at any time.<br/><br/>If you survive until 3:00... you may have a chance to escape.<br/><br/>Have fun, but not too much fun. This is supposed to be a horror game.<br/><br/>Just remember: <strong>Seek Or Die</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/29030a88a9ffafb1958a22b81dcfb49e.jpg", "website": "https://flashynurav.itch.io/seek-or-die", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 120}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flashynurav"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FLNStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
