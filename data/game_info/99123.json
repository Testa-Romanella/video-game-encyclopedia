{"id": 99123, "slug": "draculas-castle-alpha-2", "name": "Dracula's Castle (Alpha 2)", "name_original": "Dracula's Castle (Alpha 2)", "description": "<p>Dracula's Castle is a horror action adventure game I'm currently developing. This is the second alpha build and since the game is in alpha, you might come across a few bugs here and there. I have so much to add and so much to do, so the game is probably gonna come out in either spring, summer or fall of 2018. It depends on a lot of factors.</p>\n<p>Alpha 2 currently features the tutorial, floor one, the basement and floor 2, so that's about 20-40 minutes of gameplay depending on how you play. The game needs more polish, needs better optimization, and I still haven't added a health bar yet. So yeah, I hope you enjoy this new alpha build, and if you like it, follow my itch.io page to get notifications when I release news about Dracula's Castle, When the game comes out I may release it on Steam, but probably not due to the quality of the game. It just doesn't look good enough to be a Steam game. I dunno. When I release it here on Itch.io it'll be free with donations allowed. I was thinking about making it a paid game, but screw that shit, everyone should be able to play my game. Unless uh, unless I do release it on Steam for some reason, then yeah I'd probably be forced to make it paid. I'd sell it cheap though! Five bucks probably.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa8c2adf7bdd6d394cd110a433966447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
