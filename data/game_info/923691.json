Test option.</p>\n<p>The Gruglomgylgungodrians knocked out our mining cargoship on the march from the VEMZ-26 asteroid cluster. Whole crew was dragged away to the nests, as nutritional food for growing larvae. You have to find and mark all the nests with beacons as soon as possible so that we can send evacuation teams. Look out for\u00a0 Kragwubdondra hiding around the nests in all area: they have fast paws and sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>To complete the task, we will supply you with a suit with a built-in self-healing device, satchel with an energy charge for a machine gun and grenade pouch. The backpack can also speed you up dramatically, but the acceleration recharge is quit long, so spend it wisely. Good luck, mercenary! The reward for completing mission will be generous!</p>\n\n<p>Move : WASD</p>\n<p>Acceleration: Shift</p>\n<p>Machine gun : left mouse button</p>\n<p>Grenades : right mouse button</p>\n<p>To mark a nest, you need to touch it for a couple of seconds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T09:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/21323c0402cb4c2ef3c2b86fc032f4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InnerCat"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
