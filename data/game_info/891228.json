It&#39;s an overgrown and fractured city that can be fully explored via the water and flying on the back of a Sunwing. A massive machine threat lurks in its shadows \u2013 a huge challenge that Aloy must overcome by using all of her skills and abilities. </p>\n<p>To achieve this grand vision technically and creatively, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to focus all our efforts on making an incredible experience exclusively for the PlayStation\u00ae5 console.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T19:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/647/64747512270db10509f04880289d0135.jpg", "website": "https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/burning-shores/", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 20, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 98, "dropped": 5, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 33, "suggestions_count": 367, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 34, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Guerrilla Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
