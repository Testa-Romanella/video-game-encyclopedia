Music will play and notes will appear on the board in according to the beat. The closer you hit the note to the beat the more points you will earn, a circle will close in around the note to help you get the perfect timing. Perfect timing will get you the most points, while hitting off-beat will get you few points. The player with the most points by the end of the song wins.</em></p><p><em>Whilst the game is not fully functional, we uploaded what we were able to finish.
