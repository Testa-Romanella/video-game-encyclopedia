My idea first was to create 3 cups with my tracks and make the Special Cup the Members' Cup. However, when spreading the idea, luckily I received more leads than I thought and ended up opening the possibility of 3 more leads for the members to do.</p>\n<p>I'm working on this project through the Epic Edit and Tile Molester programs, where I managed to make some changes that will be explained below:</p>\n<p>- Character exchange</p>\n<p>VERSION 1.0</p>\n<p>I got some sprites from other hacks and asked the subscribers and members what they would like to see in the hack, via Poll, the characters were chosen:</p>\n<p>- Ken</p>\n<p>- Pikachu</p>\n<p>- Plankton</p>\n<p>- Bomberman</p>\n<p>- Ryu</p>\n<p>- R. Mcdonald</p>\n<p>- Donkey Kong - DKC</p>\n<p>- Sonic</p>\n<p>VERSION 1.1</p>\n<p>- Mario</p>\n<p>- Shyguy</p>\n<p>- Bowser Jr.</p>\n<p>- Kamek</p>\n<p>- Luigi</p>\n<p>- Yoshi Red</p>\n<p>- Wario</p>\n<p>- Diddy Kong</p>\n<p>NOTE: As the characters are removed from other hacks, we will have Two versions of the hack, SLK Version 1.0 (With the characters changed) and SLK Version 1.1 (Characters from the Super Mario Universe).</p>\n\n<p>We accept donations to create amazing new hacks like this one, but you can download the patch for free.<br/></p>\n<p>If you wanted to help us, please contact me by email:</p>\n<p>lukenovaes@hotmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2e39461b283b9d883baada5bffac3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
