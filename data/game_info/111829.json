You can resupply their food, but they will inevitably perish. It's a cruel world out there.\r\n\t Some cats live longer than others, some are bigger, some last longer on the same food. Every F5 creates a new family of cats.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>Enable VR: Click the goggle-icon in the bottom right</li>\n<li>Look around: Drag the mouse / literally look around in VR</li>\n<li>Move around: WASD</li>\n<li>Fill food bowl (not in VR): Aim at the bowl &amp; click</li>\n<li>Fill food bowl (in VR): Aim at the bowl &amp; wait a second</li>\n<li>Fill all bowls instantly (for ease of use): E</li>\n</ul>\r\nReviews\r\n<p>\r\n\"You can put on your VR headset and pretend you're in a house full of cats.\" \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t~ \r\n\tJupiter Hadley\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis project uses \r\n\tA-Frame which is great and makes WebVR dev very similar to normal web dev.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe sounds are from Freesound.org by the following people:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meows by theshaggyfreak</li>\n<li>Noms by niwki</li>\n</ul>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe code is licensed under the \r\n\tMIT License.
