When the theme was revealed the idea of having a shared resource as the main mechanic was interesting to me. I worked towards a Super Crate Box esque game where the enemies drop Powerups, which affect both the enemies and the player. picking up a bonus to speed will make all the enemies move faster as well etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All this gave me a nice chance to try my hand at a 2D game, which i haven't really done before, and i played around with a lot of the new preview packages from unity. Besides that i made the pixelart, and even some animations (of which i'm pretty proud!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/048a477a6e6e2a79fda952a87c906814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MoreMagical"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
