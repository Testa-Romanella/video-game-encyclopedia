So I learned a lot already! Worked on it for about one full day.</p>\n<p>Pixels having sex was alright, so I went for cubical animals (and humans)!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Final concept</strong><br/>A simple simulation game,\u00a0with animals\u00a0eating, death and\u00a0procreate. Used the tree's to build new huts for your workers to let them multiply and move animals around to keep them from getting extinct. But watch out for bears, they kill you. Keep al the spiecies and humans alive. If one dies out, its game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Concept</strong><br/>An idle game with a few animals doing stuff on there own, lots of stuff still doesn't work great but at leased is some one of a rounded off thing... Better luck next time ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Used assets:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Low Poly Animated People<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/low-poly-animated-people-109...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>3LE Low Poly Cloud Pack<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/3le-low-poly-cloud-pack-65911</p>\n<p>Free Low Poly Nature Asset<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/free-low-poly-nature-asset-6...</p>\n<p>Easy Grass Substance<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/easy-grass-su...</p>\n<p>Yughues Free Fur Materials<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/yughues-free-fur-mat...</p>\n<p>Lowpoly Simple House<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/lowpoly-simple-house-117348</p>\n<p>371 Simple Buttons Pack<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/371-simple-buttons-pack-97516</p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T06:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09cf0b5c601221d5f5508f34158512e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GULDOR, Learning to Code"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
