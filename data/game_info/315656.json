The objective is to rack up as many points as possible by constructing buildings and killing enemies. You must spawn workers to build, but every worker spawned removes a life point from the queen. <br/><br/>There are three types of buildings:</p>\n<p>- Heart (pink): These\u00a0buildings\u00a0will\u00a0generate\u00a0life\u00a0for\u00a0the Queen.</p>\n<p>- Spawner (orange): These buildings will generate new workers.</p>\n<p>- Turret (blue): These buildings will attack incoming enemies, be sure to place them in strategic locations.</p>\n\n<p>Tips and tricks:<br/>- Once a heart is fully grown, click on it to give the queen life</p>\n<p>- You can use the keyboard for the bottom buttons (w)Add Worker, (b)Build, (c)Consume Workers<br/>- Sometimes a run is just no good if you're not spawning any hearts or turrets, you can always run your life out and then try again<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5cf1051df69012611828a7ac61802b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodyMace"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
