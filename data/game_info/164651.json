This makes it more difficult for the player to master, but yields more rewards upon successful completion. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c2e1e034cee4cdcc805e8723608859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pauline Martyn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
