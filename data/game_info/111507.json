Exhibiting selected work within a virtual-reality environment, Milk Gallery creates a new way to experience artwork within the context of a gallery and features a new exhibit monthly with artists from around the globe. Pioneering the virtual-reality environment space, Milk Gallery is not limited by normal constraints such as physical distance or costly instillation of larger pieces. The Gallery can additionally feature artwork that may be ideally displayed in a digital setting (e.g. 3D art) as well as artwork which may not be able to exist in physical space (e.g. 4D art).</p><p>Contact us via email or twitter to feature your work in The Milk Gallery</p><p>milkgallery.inquiry@gmail.com</p><p>Created by:</p><p>@beefmilk</p><p>With help from</p><p>@theo_variations</p><p>Enjoy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de6394ab1c0701519028f8a102a8e6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MilkGallery"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
