Defeating enemies grants you spell charges, which can be used to cast spells learned from spell books found throughout the dungeon.</p>\n<p>This game was created by one person (me) in two weeks for the Roguelike Jam of 2022. The theme of the jam was \"Unstable\", and for my project I decided to interpret that theme by making the player cause an explosion if they collect too many of any given spell charge.* That way, you have to use up your spell charges as you collect them or risk taking damage!</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><ul><li>Use W, A, S, and D or arrow keys to move</li><li>Click on an adjacent enemy (with no spell selected) to melee attack<br/>\n</li><li>Kill enemies to collect spell charges which are used to cast spells (currently there is no visible indication of how many charges you have, but each enemy you kill grants one charge of its element)</li><li>Collect spell books around the dungeon to add them to your spell roster</li><li>Use number keys (1, 2, etc.) to select a spell from your spell roster at the bottom of the screen</li><li>Click on an enemy with a spell selected to cast the spell</li></ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is currently in a very early prototype state, and not all intended features have been implemented or work properly. Please report any issues found in the game and I will attempt to resolve them in future releases.</p>\n<p>For MacOS &amp; Linus users: Builds for these systems have not been tested, as I\u00a0do not have a machine that can run them. Be aware of this and use your own discretion when downloading &amp; running the game.</p>\n<p>*this feature is currently untested, and there is no in-game indication that it is happening. Future releases will fix this issue</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Units (enemies, player) can sometimes move into the same grid tile &amp; become stuck</li><li>Turns don't process quite like they are intended to; eg. Flaming Dot should have the same turn frequency as the player, but they are inconsistent</li><li>Various UI elements are either not implemented, placeholder, or have other minor problems</li><li>Player will occasionally take unexpected damage, which can lead to unintended game over</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T11:45:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f425524d4960c20343b14e754d4fc54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Obsidiman"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
