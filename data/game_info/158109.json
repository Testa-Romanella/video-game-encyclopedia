You are here to destroy a lot of aliens. Your mission is to clear an enemy sector.<br/><br/>If they keep going, fight them as long as you can. There are only a couple thousands of them, so it's not a big deal... <em>probably.</em><br/><br/>Your company has developed a brand new weapon that absorbs dead enemies' energy and makes you able to kill more and more of them. And you're so lucky to test it.<br/><br/>You have to return alive to deliver gathered results.<br/><br/>Dead enemies drop some microcircuits (if not damaged) that can be implanted into your ship to improve its durability. They can also drop some stolen from humans written-off ammunition if they have some.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db64e7e680a6a2fb1ea92a2b9a34d90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alien Jellyfish"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
