Fueled mostly by tea, he is working full time on Fringe Planet - and often wishes there were more hours in the day.

There are both extensive blog posts and daily tweets about development on the Fringe Planet website.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/3961a1ae1a277522e7adcea27b95c156.jpg", "website": "https://fringeplanetgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sigil Initiative"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Sigil Initiative"], "esrb_rating": null}
