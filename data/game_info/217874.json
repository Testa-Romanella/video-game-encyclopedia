This game demands huge observation, great patience and challenging spirit! This is also an extremely relaxing game that tens of thousands of people are enjoying it every day! <br/><br/>***Game goal <br/>Clear the board by removing two identical tiles on a same line each time as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>***Remove tiles<br/>Two identical tiles on a same line are removable. Note that you can move tiles but only once.<br/><br/>****Game features <br/>The game proceeds with no hints, no help and no re-try. There is no any assistance to you but your hard observation. You can press the \u201cEnd\u201d button to see remaining removable pairs, but the game will end at the same time.<br/><br/>**** Compared with other games<br/>Many people know similar games like Dikaku, Sichuan Mahjong or Shanghai Mahjong. But in fact, you will enjoy more in playing this game. The reason is that those games are merely static games, and you just play them passively. However, zMahjong is a dynamic game in that it keeps changing along with the whole game period. For example, when your game enters the mid-stage, you will probably find that it is becoming increasingly difficult and it seems as if there won't be any removable pairs. But often you will soon realize that once you can find out one pair, the whole game can totally change. Also, since the game allows tiles to be moved before one pair of tiles is removed, the game requires very much challenging spirit to find out the possible removable pairs. Once you can find out one pair and remove it, you will anticipate that new removable pairs can be created. Thus, whether you can finally complete the game or not, you have already been enjoying every step you have played. So that you will never be disappointed with yourself. You will start a new whether you have finished a game or not.
