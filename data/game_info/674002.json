You\u2019re here for a story? Well...thinking about this story really gives back pain. Fine, gather around, I\u2019ll tell ya a story. A story that takes place on a night similar to this one.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Halloween night, my friends and I sneaked into an rickety old house and found ourselves facing supernatural obstacles. However, the biggest obstacle of all was my attitude. Will I save those who I love? Or will I be haunted by my past forever?<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the characters, let me begin-. Wait, they made our story a game? Oh great! Now you don\u2019t have to listen to me yammer on about it.
