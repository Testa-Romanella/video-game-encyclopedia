Not being a programmer, this application made making an immersive game fairly simple. I have been using Twine to make my games so far, but you are very limited in the interaction there, and truthfully I\u00a0do not enjoy playing this kind of interactive fiction game as much as I\u00a0do old school JRPGs, though they haven't been my go-to since Pok\u00e9mon Red and Dragon Warrior Monsters in the late 90s.\r\n</p>\n<p>For the narrative, I\u00a0kept it fairly simple this time, focusing on the feels rather than dialogue, though I think the dialogue you get is fun, adding to the atmosphere. I am a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns, especially by Sergio Leone like \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\", so that is the vibe I was going for here. Though it does have a horror twist.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17a3855df58549a507798def8a39b843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kaptain Viciorious"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
