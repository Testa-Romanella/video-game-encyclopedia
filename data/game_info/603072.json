Search your memory for Tamil and English, and alter your surroundings by casting familiar words on characters and environments. Will you use context clues to fill in the blanks, or rely on making connections to decipher this forgotten mother tongue? You can grow your vocabulary, and your abilities, by translating the worlds around you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But with every interpretation applied, who or what is lost along the way?\r\n</p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of Tamil required.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Demo currently available with full flat support on Windows and limited support on Oculus PCVR (contact us for VR build).</p>\n<p>The current demo is currently still being optimized, and a decent computer is recommended for smooth performance. The game runs extremely well on our machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, and 8 GB of RAM, though the minimum specifications for running the game are far lower. In terms of external hardware, all that is required is a keyboard and mouse (can also use trackpad).</p>\n<p>Please note that the build\u00a0uses tinylytics to collect player data during gameplay. This data is fully anonymized, is only relevant to gameplay, and is used for the strict purpose of improving the experience of playing the game.
