{"id": 38731, "slug": "ben-there-dan-that", "name": "Ben There, Dan That!", "name_original": "Ben There, Dan That!", "description": "<p>Ben There, Dan That! is a comical game about two buddies. The name of the game is a pun on &quot;Been there, done that&quot; and the game&#39;s main protagonists, Ben and Dan. They are named after the game&#39;s creators.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The story of Ben and Dan is written in the vein of movies like Bill &amp; Ted&#39;s Bogus Journey. Ben and Dan are two friends who always wind up in misadventures. In the game&#39;s prologue, Ben has to reanimate Dan who became a zombie in the Peruvian jungle. As the game begins, the two are back to their London apartment. They try to fix their TV antenna to watch their favorite TV show, Magnum P.I. As a result, they are miraculously transported to an alien ship and have to find their way home.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is a traditional point-and-click adventure in which the characters have to use items from their inventory to solve puzzles. The player controls both Dan and Ben, switching between them when needed. There&#39;s a number of ways the characters can interact with the items and the environment. Each of them is highlighted by the shape of the cursor: a boot to move, a hand to take, an eye to look, etc.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game uses a very primitive cartoonish style with minimal animation, somewhat similar to animated comedies like South Park. It features a lot of long yet hilarious dialogues with occasional toilet humor. Ben There, Dan That! takes inspiration from the Lucas Arts adventure games like Sam &amp; Max and Full Throttle and contains references to them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T09:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c5042cb7f136abdd6fd6905d0d4e3dc.jpg", "website": "http://www.zombie-cow.com/?page_id=17", "rating": 2.53, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 391, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zombie Cow Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Zombie Cow Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
