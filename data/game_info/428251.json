Traverse the landscape as Mya, a desert wanderer, in order to return the spirits of the Geomancers to their sacred mosaic. Gifted with the power of the Geomancers by the mosaic\u2019s guardian spirit, Mya will elevate pillars of earth and bend rocks to her will to overcome the obstacles of the desert, solve the puzzles within the Geomancers\u2019 abandoned temples, and overcome the Golem that\u2019s been awoken by the decaying mosaic!<br/><br/>Mya of the Desert is a Puzzle Platforming game with an emphasis on using earth manipulation abilities to solve environmental puzzles. Made by graduate students at the University of Utah\u2019s EAE program, this thesis project represents two years of learning.<br/><br/>Key Features:<br/><ul><li>Learn the Powers of the Geomancers: Extrude pillars of earth from the ground!
