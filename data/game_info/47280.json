Drag and drop as many drums as you want from your drum palette, and arrange and scale them with ease to set up the drum set that works best for you. Save your drum sets so that you can load up your favorite whenever you come back.Realistic Sound System<br/>Just because it\u2019s virtual, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t sound real. In Paradiddle, drums give off different sounds based on a variety of factors, with some drums supporting over 100 sounds just based on how hard they were hit.A Platform for Sharing and Learning<br/>Record your songs and share your recordings with others in the Paradiddle community. Play back other people\u2019s recordings and slow them down if you\u2019d like, to get a better idea of how the piece was performed. Paradiddle uses visual cues to show when each drum is about to get hit, while the recording is being played right in front of you. It opens up many possibilities for learning how to drum that simply weren\u2019t possible before.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/2720021559a23995a80ebbdf67065edf.jpg", "website": "http://paradiddleapp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 77, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emre Tanirgan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emre Tanirgan"], "esrb_rating": null}
