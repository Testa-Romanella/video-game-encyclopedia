Thanks!**</strong></p>\n<p>Oh no! The Game (DOS) has sadly ran out of disk space (not enough floppy disks). In a desperate attempt to salvage the project the game is deleting its own levels. In the midst of its painful struggle it completely forgot that you, the Player (transistBOT) are a key part of the Game. If you are deleted, it's all gone. Get to your hub immediately so you can get back to work.<br/><br/>This game has 5 challenging levels (1 boss level) all of which should take you 7-10 minutes to finish. How many deaths must you suffer till the end?<br/><br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>- Arrow Keys | Move Left and Right</p>\n<p>- X | Jump</p>\n<p>- Space | Restart Current Level</p>\n<p>- Esc | Go back to home menu &amp; Exit Game</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Known Issues</strong><br/>- Game sometimes not properly recognising when the Player landed on the ground thus not playing a sound effect or playing a particle effect<br/>- Mini-hops murdering ears (level 2 prime example)</p>\r\n\u00a0Changelog\r\nVersion 1.1: August 13'th 2018:\r\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>\n<p>-WEBGL BUILD WOOO!</p>\n<p>-The hitbox for the pointer has been greatly increased</p>\n<p>-Can finally exit the windows build</p>\n<p>-Can now return to home menu</p>\n<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>\n<p>-Fixed unintentional level exploit on Level 3</p>\n<p>-Fixed unintentional level exploit on the Boss Level (Level 5)</p>\n<p>-Can no longer jump around pointer infinitely</p>\n<p>-Fixed player collider not being disabled when selected by pointer</p>\n<p>-The rare crash on level 1 seems to have dissapeared</p>\n<p>=========================================</p>\n<p>This game was made with the amazing BitPotion font by Joeb Rogers.
