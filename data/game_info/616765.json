In this third-person action-adventure game, you are Star-Lord, and thanks to your bold yet questionable leadership, you have persuaded an oddball crew of unlikely heroes to join you. Some jerk (surely not you) has set off a chain of catastrophic events, and only you can hold the unpredictable Guardians together long enough to fight off total interplanetary meltdown. Use Element Blasters, tag-team beat downs, jet boot-powered dropkicks, nothing\u2019s off-limits. If you think it\u2019s all going to plan, you\u2019re in for a world of surprises, with the consequences of your actions guaranteed to keep the Guardians on their toes. In this original Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy story, you\u2019ll cross paths with powerful new beings and unique takes on iconic characters, all caught in a struggle for the galaxy\u2019s fate. It\u2019s time to show the universe what you\u2019re made of. You got this. Probably.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T19:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/708/7080e6c87e0825cb02888bf3c44b3889.jpg", "website": "https://www.gotggame.com", "rating": 4.31, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 267, "owned": 2517, "beaten": 816, "toplay": 424, "dropped": 116, "playing": 92}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 169, "ratings_count": 800, "suggestions_count": 768, "game_series_count": 31, "reviews_count": 835, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Eidos Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
