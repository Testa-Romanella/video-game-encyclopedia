No other app helps you build sealed, draft and standard constructed decks quite like XRay! <br/><br/>* Rate your deck build<br/>* Get detailed card stats for your deck<br/>* Perfect your mana base<br/>* Automatic deck building suggestions<br/>* Level up your Mulligan skills<br/><br/>Quick video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlApQ6OebEM<br/><br/>What app can perfect your mana beyond anything you could do on a calculator?  Why not let XRay play thousands of games in 1-2 minutes and give you a pro level answer.<br/><br/>Try building your own deck and then ask XRay what it would have built.  It's fun.<br/><br/>Want to solve your sealed pool from scratch?  Just hit the \"Think\" button and give it 5 - 15 minutes. **<br/><br/>Got a brew idea?  Tell XRay the top 4 cards you want in your deck and let it solve the rest with \"Think\".  The results are based off XRay \"goldfishing\" millions of games and counting which decks played the most mana and curved out the best.<br/><br/>XRay can analyze and help with:<br/>* Sealed<br/>* Draft<br/>* Constructed<br/>* Brawl (but no specific commander function)<br/><br/>The cards in Standard are available in your deck lists.  <br/>Important mechanics like dual mana, slow lands, fast lands, mana rocks and mana dorks are programmed in.  <br/><br/>Mana is the fundamental theory of what makes a good limited deck and should teach new players how to build basic curves by example, and experienced players can go very deep tweaking / fine-tuning scenarios.<br/><br/>We are active devs.  As new sets come out we include them for now, might charge minimally in the future.  <br/><br/>Reminder: we are not Hasbro - and we are not Wizards of the coast.  We are passionate players like you that just want to improve.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy, and happy brewing!<br/>Travis Somerville and team.<br/><br/>Contact info:<br/>info@mtgxray.com<br/>https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgxray<br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast, Magic: The Gathering, and their logos are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast LLC. \u00a9 1995-2017 Wizards.
