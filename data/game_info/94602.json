In this brick breaker game you use your paddle to hit the balls to smash the bricks as usual, but with a few added twists. There\u2019s a choice of weapons and Alchemite to harvest which are exchanged for ammo, extra balls and extra lives. Not to mention asteroid and shoot-em-up sub-games. Played normally it is very challenging, so the key to surviving to the end level is careful planning and resource management. Fun as 1-player or up to 3 players local multiplayer.</p>\n<p>Progress is saved automatically and once you've used up all your lives it's game over, so spend Alchemite on extra lives and balls when you can and use ammo sparingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong>\u2666 240+ levels<br/>\u2666 Level editor<br/>\u2666 Up to 3 player local co-op<br/>\u2666 Use any control method: mouse (recommended), game controller, keyboard, touch<br/>\u2666 Shop: mine Alchemite from each level and trade it for ammo, balls &amp; extra lives<br/>\u2666 Under 10M lightweight download.<br/>\u2666 Permadeath: no endless saving &amp; loading means more challenging gameplay<br/>\u2666 Local achievements &amp; leaderboard - no need to be online<br/>\u2666 Weapons: Auto cannon, laser &amp; rocket launcher<br/>\u2666 Solid gameplay physics<br/>\u2666 Modding feature<br/>\u2666 Regular updates<br/>\u2666 Mysterious power-ups, portals, helper bots, sub-games, and much more</p>\n<p><strong>Coming Soon:</strong>\u00a0(if there\u2019s enough demand)<br/>\u2666 100+ Elite levels - extremely difficult levels<br/>\u2666 100+ Retro levels - original style Breakout levels<br/>\u2666 Mac, Linux &amp; iOS versions<br/>\u2666 Cloud-based achievements &amp; leaderboards<br/>\u2666 More achievements<br/>\u2666 Hard difficulty level</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended minimum requirements:<br/>\u2666</strong> Windows: XP, Vista, 8 &amp; 10<br/>\u2666 CPU: 1Ghz<br/>\u2666 DirectX: 9.0 or later<br/>\u2666 Hard Disk: 10mb<br/>\u2666 RAM: 128mb<br/>\u2666 Video RAM: 32mb</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cd74dcf999fbe6cf3ee21e9e51e5374.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["POW Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
