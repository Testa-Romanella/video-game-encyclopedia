In their opinion, the problem is the increase of concentration of freons and nitric oxide in the atmosphere, which are detrimental to the ozone layer. The destruction of the ozone layer can lead to serious consequences for the ecology of the planet: an increase in the intensity of ultraviolet radiation, the formation of new desert areas and lower yields\u00bb.\r\n<p><em>From the newspaper \"Environmental news\u00bb (2006)</em></p>\r\n\u00abMore and more well-known experts say that the problem of ozone holes is only an element of political and economic war, but does not pose a specific threat to humanity.\u00bb\r\n<p><em>From the reports of news feeds (2048)</em></p>\r\n\u00abThe scale of the ecological catastrophe seems to be irreversible.
