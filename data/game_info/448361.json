Shuffle Deck.<br/>Deal cards to a 3x3 grid. If dealing a card would make it the 2nd \u2663 in that row or column, discard it instead and retry with the next card from the shuffled deck.</p>\n<p>After dealing, reshuffle Aces &amp; Kings back into the Deck.</p>\n<p>Each turn you draw a card from the Deck.<br/>You slide it onto the grid by pushing at the edge of a row or column. Your new card can only slide on if the old card leaving the 3x3 grid matches these rules:<br/>\u2666 off: Any card can slide on.<br/>\u2665 off: Higher \u2666\u2665\u2663\u2660 slides on.<br/>\u2663 off: Higher \u2663\u2665, any \u2660 slides on.<br/>\u2660 off: same rank \u2666\u2665\u2663, lower \u2663 slides on.</p>\n<p>Aces always slide on.<br/>Jokers sabotage your Court.<br/>When a Joker is drawn, discard the middle card and place the Joker in its place.
