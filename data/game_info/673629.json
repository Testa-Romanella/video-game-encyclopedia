The monster starts from the left of the screen and slowly follows the player across. The challenge is faced by the monster and navigating as fast as possible to continue through the level. It's Pac, man, but not really.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The overall game idea would surround the player's ability to dash and bounce through narrow corridors. The game will be a 2D platformer, much like geometry dash. From start to end, the player's goal is to navigate these corridors and collect light bulbs to keep the lights on, while spring bouncing off walls and floors to reach certain areas to keep moving. The challenge is added by a shadow monster that follows from the left of the screen to the right, triggering the lights to switch off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54f00a602fcfa01bfef24ced808453e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Senpai Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
