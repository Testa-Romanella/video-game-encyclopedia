He pissed off his cat Lula and now she\u2019s out to get him. And Lula is far from sweet. She is vicious, cold and unforgiving. More dangerous than Lula are her traps \u2013 deadly and brutal killing contraptions with Max\u2019s name written all over them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSHE WANTS ME DEAD is a side-scrolling platform game, released along megastars CAZZETTE\u2019s new hit single with the same name. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour job is to help poor Max, whose only hope is to get through Lula\u2019s deadly gauntlets in one piece. This might sound easy, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Lula really, really wants Max dead. But there is help.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCAZZETTE\u2019S NEW HIT SONG plays a major role in the game. Lula\u2019s traps and other things in the environment move in rhythm with the music. Are you groovy enough to help Max find safe passage? Or are you as stiff as the corpse he\u2019ll be when the traps hit?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nContent:<br/>\r\n- Crazy hard platform levels<br/>\r\n- Deadly traps<br/>\r\n- Gold frame achievements <br/>\r\n- A bunch of silly cat pictures<br/>\r\n- Awesome clothes and accessories<br/>\r\n- Steam Trading Cards", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T22:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd9399ab23a294bc6e19fc88a8265f5e.jpg", "website": "http://www.hellothere.se", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 56, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Hello There"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Hello There Holding", "Hello There"], "esrb_rating": null}
