Finally, I decided to look at it. I found three files. Each had a single video clip inside. For the sake of this post, I\u2019m just going to call the content of these folders \u201ctapes\u201d. The name of tape 1 is setam_yalp_wen. In the first few minutes of the tape, I thought that this was an amateur film put together by a bunch of college students. Then I thought it was a prank or a hoax of some kind. However, as I continued to watch, I realized I couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Watch at your own risk.</p>\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p>The Ones Left Waiting\u00a0is an episodic horror adventure divided into three chapters. This Game is the first Chapter. Game is made with love, and created by one person. Game features original story, digital art, and music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-------------------<br/><br/>Four paranormal vlogging college students venture into the mountainous wilderness of Pennsylvania to investigate strange happenings near an abandoned mining town. A local informs the team of a forsaken mansion that seems to reside in the middle of these peculiar events. Although the team is used to faking their evidence for the sake of views, the specters they encounter in the sticks of Pennsylvania are anything but a hoax.<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------</p>\n<p>Tips for gameplay: Interact with lanterns to save your progress!!! You can't access your inventory or the menu while in game. If an item needs to be used somewhere, it will do it without the player having to retrieve it from inventory. Don't use the mouse, it's not beneficial to the overall experience. This is a puzzle game so keep a pen and not pad handy. ;)<br/>Controls:<br/>Space = Interact/OK<br/>Arrow keys = Move<br/>Shift = Run<br/>X = Back space<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12eb09671dc4edc9ddcd835d5abe4808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Moon_Child_Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
