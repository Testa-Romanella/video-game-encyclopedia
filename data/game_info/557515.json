Use leftover bananas collected in order to purchase upgrades to help you collect more of the falling bananas, faster! Features 4 unique purchasable upgrades, a win condition, and a mute button in case you don't want to hear my terrible attempt at \"music.\"</p>\n<p>This is the first feature complete game I've ever made, and also the first game I've ever made with 100% original assets. I'm not very good at art, and I'm terrible at\u00a0 music, but at least I\u00a0can say it's mine!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>*Bananas don't always get destroyed when touching a basket, but they will still count towards your score.</p>\n<p>*If there are too many sounds at once, the volume will drop a lot and many sounds will be hard to hear.</p>\n<p>*Bananas can still be clicked for a short time after they fall below the UI.</p>\n<p>*If clicked fast enough (with a macro only), bananas can be clicked multiple times.</p>\n<p>*Gibbon's animations will bug out if you are earning bananas too fast (animation is supposed to be on a 3-second minimum cooldown, not sure why this happens)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874cdbb083f0bf6a14641401549c1a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PotassiumBromide"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
