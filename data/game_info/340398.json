{"id": 340398, "slug": "duel-wield", "name": "Duel Wield", "name_original": "Duel Wield", "description": "<p>Another prototype project I created while teaching myself some coding. With this one I wanted to produce a top down shooter with a unique twist. Your Character has two guns which can aim in different directions. It is a very simple game with deadly boxes coming to attack you. Just a little warning. The music is very loud!</p>\n<p>I have unfortunately lost the Unity Project for this game so further development for this game is unlikely. This also means I am unable to fix the unfortunate spelling errors in the game. However please feel free to leave comments with criticism if you would like to see me return to this.</p>\n<p>Music by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/></p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:01:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e4e1333edff93765917c1ac508cd5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fluffy Dino"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
