Talk to people and help them out with their problems! Trade things for other things! Play with \"Dogs\"! The possibilities are infinite!</p><p>I'll admit that this game isn't optimized as well as it could be, so if you do decide to play it things might slow down at certain points. Most notably when you go in and out of buildings. Don't load scenes in unity if you don't have to kids. Anyway, unoptimized as it is I put enough time into this that I'd rather people see a few frames of it than have it sit on a hard drive somewhere never to see the light of day. So here it is!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7be3f9e9ee579e8dcfd820db920282fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arcadim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
