You need to collect their energy in order to fill up your life shield. <br/>Enjoy :D<br/>The controls are :</p>\n<p>Shooter Part :<br/>ZQSD or Keyboard Arrows to move.<br/>Your mouse allows you to orient the ship.</p>\n<p>You can fire with left click.</p>\n<p>Esc to get to the pause menu.</p>\n<p>Be careful, you have a reloading bar on the side of your ship, in case your gun overheat, you won't be able to use it for a small period of time!<br/></p>\n<p>Puzzle Part :<br/></p>\n<p>You can spawn a form that needs to be filled into the puzzle part of the game by clicking on the associated icon.<br/>You can press R while holding a form to rotate it.</p>\n<p>You can drop it by clicking again.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>We had little time to put it all together, that's why it might be a bit confusing !\r\n </p>\n<p>On the first part, you are in a shooter arcade game, where some weird  forms (that happens to be letters) are spawning. When you destroy them,  you \"collect\" their form. \r\nOnce you think, you have enough of these  forms, you can press Esc to get into the pause menu and get to the  puzzle part with the signs you collected (they appear as a number and a  form in the puzzle part), you can fill the letters in the puzzle. If you  fill enough of it, you'll get a score based on your time to collect the  forms (and in theory based on the forms used be we did not had enough  time for this :( )\r\n </p>\n<p>If you can't fill the puzzle up, than you can go back to the shooter part but you'll get a penality! \r\nThe goal is just to clear the level / have the greatest score (But the score is not perfectly implemented yet)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:55:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fd/5fd5ece8ca15e50e69ce0026bc858f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axelgoris99"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
