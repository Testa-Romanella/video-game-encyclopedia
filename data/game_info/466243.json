The trial is designed for those who seek to control the Demonic Sword. The Sword requires complete purification in order to fully control it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to complete this purification process and/or win the game, player needs to use the Demonic Sword power to kill demons in the trial instance. Upon defeating a demon, an amount of purification percentage (PP) will be awarded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every usage of the Sword power costs an amount of energy (EP) and may inflict self-damage due to the Sword being out of control. The amount of self-inflicted damage decreases as PP increases (starting at 20 damage when PP is at 0% down to 0 damage when PP is at 100%). EP automatically increases\u00a0a small amount every few seconds. Additionally, potions can be picked up to recover HP and EP. The trial instance also contains various event points where a random event will be triggered to either increase or decrease HP/EP/PP.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's up to the player to choose\u00a0which strategy to win this game. As each demon will be re-spawned after an amount of time after death, player can choose to remain in one location to farm for PP or choose to explore the trial instance\u00a0via teleportation\u00a0and/or jumping through platforms. Player can also make use\u00a0of event points throughout the instance to win the game faster if lucky enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Game controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement:\u00a0W A S D || Arrow Keys\u00a0</li><li>Jump: Spacebar</li><li>Use the Demonic Sword power:\u00a0Left Mouse Button || Left Ctrl\u00a0</li><li>Pause: Esc\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made for GMTK Game\u00a0Jam 2020 from July 10, 2020 to July 12, 2020.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3b52056d194f4d5e73c29a344557942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Over-Dramatics"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
