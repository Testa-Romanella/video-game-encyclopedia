The player arrives in the Cosmic Egg, a ship capable of traveling through time anywhere in the universe, and even altering its scale to shrink below the size of an atom or larger than the stars<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe objective is to build the universe starting from the first fundamental particles and ending with a Solar System and habitable Planet Earth.  From a first-person perspective, players will need to capture sub-atomic particles floating through space and combine them to make the first elements in the universe in this indie, puzzle-solving adventure.  Tools include an extendable claw, and electromagnetic tool, and a particle launcher, all of which, when used in the right order on the right particle, can create new particles in the universe.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee68d79e31b320e5c05ec1693944997.jpg", "website": "https://thestardustmystery.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBeamer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TheBeamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
