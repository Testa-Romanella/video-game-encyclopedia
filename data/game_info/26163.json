They make noise as they \n      bounce. Toy with the angles of the leaves.<br/>Normally an aquatic \n      creature, Hanenbow sometimes use floating leaves to launch themselves \n      out of the water, creating strange sounds and melodies as they bounce \n      off of leaves. Entire schools of Hanenbow have been known to launch out \n      of the water, one after another! As a leaf is repeatedly hit by flying \n      Hanenbow, it gradually changes color. This also alters the sound made by \n      bouncing Hanenbow. When all of the leaves turn red, a flower will bloom. \n      It is still unclear why the Hanenbow display this curious behavior.\n    </p><p>\n      More Electroplankton Games!\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Trapy\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Rec-Rec\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Nanocarp\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Beatnes\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f517065f97652c961cf304029f1c5672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
