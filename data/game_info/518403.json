There's a torch that lasts 60 seconds, of which you can make more of at the campfire, and axe you can use to chop wood (You can drop these with X and C). You've got to keep the fire burning! <br/><br/>Feel free to explore, but there isn't much there, this was my first time messing around with 3D in Godot. It was certainly fun to explore and I'll certainly be doing it again<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T06:51:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c6740a93b339f3c6051ce8c1557f18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rimmerworld"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
