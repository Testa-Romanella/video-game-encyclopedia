When your owner leaves the apartment to go to work, you get bored pretty fast, and since you are still a cat, you have the urge to break things. However, the owner put all the things that you wanted to break high on the shelves because of the amount of time that you had done in the past. Luckily, cardboard boxes that Emily had left around can help Orange's goal. While things seem too easy, Orange remembers that it can be difficult if he does not put the items correctly. You can strategize with the cardboard boxes, your surroundings, and the best building strategy to get Orange to get his goal.\r\n</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Check Tutorial Menu in the game\u00a0</p><p><strong>Game\u00a0Design\u00a0Team</strong></p><p>Tyler Tran - Game\u00a0Designer</p><p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p><p><strong>Assets</strong>:</p>\n<p>Lowpoly Toon Cat Lite - Omabuarts Studio</p>\n<p>Classic Picture Frame -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vertex Studio</p>\n<p>Household_Items</p>\n<p>Free Furniture Set - DEXSOFT</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>:</p>\n<p>Little Samba - Quincas Moreira</p>\n<p>The Trapezist - Quincas Moreira</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T13:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/deb9dc90a6b1d73d7ab88d719ed6e9de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tylertuan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
