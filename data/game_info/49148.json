It is known for its fiery nature and its tendency to lead travelers astray.  Curious to see the Wisps for yourself, you ventured into the forest.  You walked until the sky grew dark and a fog descended.  You came across a pond and decided to rest.  Then you saw a green light hovering over the water.  Its luminance revealed a path of raised earth.  The light beckoned you to follow, and so, carefully, you walked the path as it wound through the water.  <br/><br/>As you suspected, it was a trap!  As had happened to so many travelers before, you had been lured astray by the strange light of the Willowisp to your doom.  At least, that was what the Wisp intended.  You had other plans.  Unlike the others, you knew what would happen and came prepared.  You were ready to fight the Wisps and make the forest safe...<br/><br/><strong>Summary</strong><br/>Use a pair of light-sabers to defend yourself from colorful wisps flying at you from all sides.
