Go through psychedelic portals, solve abstract puzzles, explore grand minimal forms or race against the stars. A science-fiction experience unlike any other game.<br/><br/>THE DESIGN<br/>A cinematic game with stunning movie-like graphics, each chapter is visually unique and explores an original concept with completely new game mechanics.<br/><br/>THE MUSIC<br/>60+ minutes of original soundtrack to heighten your sense of wonder. The soundtrack features a variety of genres and has been tailored to every movement on the screen. Best experienced with headphones.<br/><br/>PHILOSOPHY<br/>Last Voyage is a game about space that is not about spaceships but rather what lies beyond our culture and technology. A game where you don't master a single task but rather explore a range of concepts. As a result, the levels are sometimes mysterious, and other times very direct. Sometimes completely still, and other times moving at the speed of light. While these chapters form a continuous narrative, you are constantly surprised with new ways to interact as you seamlessly transition from one chapter to another.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b2f8ceacef0c750534cf08b4fedc92.jpg", "website": "http://semido.me/lastvoyage/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Semidome"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Semidome"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
