Role</strong><br/><br/>The game currently has 3 characters set. They have their own fighting characteristics. You can choose your favorite character fighting style to experience the game.<br/>At the same time, different professions will have some of their own exclusive equipment. When you get these equipment, you may wish to switch to this profession to try out this equipment and you may have different fun.<br/><br/><strong>2.Map</strong><br/><br/>Our game currently has two styles and four layers of maps (more in the future). Each time a new map is entered, content event combat objects are randomly generated at different levels.<br/>Each time you go forward and encounter certain events will consume physical strength. When the physical strength is 0, there will be some negative events, so remember to feed yourself.<br/>At the same time there will be a variety of stories to collect.<br/><br/><strong>3. Reward</strong><br/><br/>Every time you live in a treasure chest, you will drop some items inside. They have different abilities.<br/>Such as the super rare powerful legendary equipment, the agent that restores life, supplements the physical food, traps the fragrant essence of the monster, escapes the fighting mucus, and so on.<br/><br/><strong>4. Battle</strong><br/><br/>The core mechanism of the battle is very simple, but it is actually an attack that is larger than the size and number of points.<br/>By calculating both the hand and the contents of the library, and finally winning through the rational use of different skill resources, it is the player who needs to think.<br/>Note that it is not always the attack that is the only way to win. There are many ways in which the enemy can destroy itself. (counterattack damage, fatigue damage, etc.)<br/><br/><strong>5. Skills</strong><br/><br/>Each time you defeat a boss or die, you will come to the accumulation interface, but there are some functional differences between the two types of entry.<br/>When you defeat boss, enter:<br/>Can not switch roles, can not switch modes, you can buy to replace the existing equipment.<br/>Enter after death:<br/>Can switch roles, can switch modes, can not buy collocation equipment.<br/><strong>6. Achievement</strong><br/><br/>We have set a lot of achievements for the game and endless modes can challenge. Guaranteed rich late playability.<br/><br/><strong>game expression</strong><br/>Unlike most independent games, we do not want to express deep truths and profound thoughts through this game.<br/>It may be related to the fact that I like playing games for a long time. When designing this game, everything is \"playing\" first.<br/>In my opinion, the fun of a game is the most important, so the unique fun and smooth game experience is placed first.<br/>Other content (art, text, sound) are all in the service core game mechanics.<br/>(whispers: Actually, I still want to express some content. I want to tell the players through this game that there is no turning back in life. Luck certainly has a great impact, but how to grasp luck is the key to success.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84ce58c1e79651b92599a355a82b97dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u638c\u70db\u6587\u5316"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u638c\u70db\u6587\u5316"], "esrb_rating": null}
