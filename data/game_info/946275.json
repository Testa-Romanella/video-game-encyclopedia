The darkness has escaped, a living shadow which envelops all life it touches, each time growing stronger. It behaves much like a shadow and is 'scared' of light, shrinking away when exposed to large amounts. The darkness has damaged parts of the facility and you have to navigate through the facility using your flashlight to solve puzzles repairing the facility and making your way out of the facility. You have to use your torch to open up paths for lasers which solve puzzles, they are another experiment gone wrong when the darkness escaped. You have to search the level for clues for door codes, find out what is happening and keep yourself alive with batteries scattered around the facility. You want to escape to survive and care little for the faceless overseer that controls the facility. </p>\n\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Lshift - sprint</p>\n<p>E - interact</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T15:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d12b162d700de5ac9c590ecc4973334e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghostanda"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
