To do this simply navigate your way to the grey panel (where the AI portrait would appear) and click on the difficulty field, then select your desired difficulty from the drop down menu and you are done<br/></p>Controls\r\n<p>You will be able to map your actions to different buttons in your controller/keyboard, but triggers aren't supported at the moment, only buttons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To get to the controller setup screen. Go from the title screen to settings, and from there press down until the \"Key Binds\" button is highlighted.
