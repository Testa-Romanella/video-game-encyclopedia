Remote, underground, isolated.<br/><br/>One of only six, he's been hired as part of an inexperienced skeleton crew. All of them are new to the job. And although each has a different reason for it, they've all chosen the isolation.<br/><br/>The base is dark, dank, and full of things that don't look like they should be there. And at the heart of it all is one machine, a glowing screen with a grid of numbers and two buttons. They're not told what it's for, only that it must be kept running, at all times of day, for a month. And that's it.<br/><br/>30 days of solitude, tasks, and other people.<br/><br/>Welcome to CELLAR.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>CELLAR is a story-focused game that takes place over 30 days, lasting around eight hours of gameplay. Events, character movements and dialogue are all unique and carefully crafted for each day.<br/><br/>Gameplay is split between story events and carrying out a series of simple tasks, although CELLAR also goes further by including story events that change gameplay in unconventional manners.<br/><br/>The game world is interactable and full of secrets, and the dialogue is down to earth, amusing and intimate. CELLAR explores our relationship with our surroundings, the effects of solitude, and the unlikely bonds that form between us.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Talking about nothing<br/></li><li>Walking in circles<br/></li><li>Getting on with things<br/></li><li>Not getting on with things<br/></li><li>Awkward silence<br/></li><li>Using the machine<br/></li><li>Trying to make a joke<br/></li><li>Don't know how to play piano<br/></li><li>Sitting down for a bit<br/></li><li>Listening politely<br/></li><li>Getting back up again<br/></li><li>Going to sleep<br/></li><li>Waking up at 3am because someone set off the alarm<br/></li><li>Waiting for the end</li></ul>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Take your time.
