You can move with standard WASD keys. This is noted here because it's a bit different for tower defense games.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting the first map click on \"Player 1\" in the top right corner and set your name. Your save game is tied to this name and all you have to do to load your game is enter the exact player name again.</p>\r\nThe First Map\r\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As indicated, the level begins when you place your first tower.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The tower icons show the current price and will show a green outline if you can afford a given type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place as many as you can in strategic places around the map to stop the advancing creeps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each map has a goal indicated with a large portal. The creeps will advance toward these goals and, in reaching them, will subtract their remaining health from the gate's health.</p>\n</li><li><p>Use abilities to support your towers.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p>If the goal reaches 0 health you lose the map.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you defeat all the creeps before that happens you win the map.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Towers can currently be placed anywhere that is NOT perfectly flat. This means: almost anywhere except in the path of the creeps. Therefore there are many places you CAN put towers but really shouldn't.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tower range is indicated during placement or by clicking on a live tower to select it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can manually set a tower's target by left clicking the tower then right clicking on a creep.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:06:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e885717992b26dc9fb17475e8375fc27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ai-defender"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
