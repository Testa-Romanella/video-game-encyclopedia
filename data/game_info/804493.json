Previous versions can be played and downloaded at\u00a0my Neocities website. For M25, I\u2019m trying out itch.io to see how it goes. Depending on how I feel about it, I might end up moving entirely from Neocities to itch.io, we\u2019ll see.</p>\n<p><em><strong>edit:</strong></em> I have decided to keep my project only on Neocities going forwards. Once the game matures more, I might revisit the decision and continue using this page. For the time being, at least M26 will remain playable here, but newer versions are going to be released and become available to be played\u00a0on the game\u2019s\u00a0Neocities page.<br/></p><p>The game (and its custom&amp;dashmade engine) are free software available under the AGPL (version 3 or later). The source can be downloaded on my Neocities page.</p>\n<p>The controls are made to be\u00a0simple. Arrow keys (left and right) move Mirai in that direction, and double&amp;dashpressing an arrow key makes Mirai jump.</p>\n<p>For touch devices, it is also possible to press and hold on the left/right side of the screen to walk, and\u00a0double&amp;dashtap on the screen to jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:03:25", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zamfofex"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
