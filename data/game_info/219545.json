However, if you cannot make your move on your turn, you will lose it and your opponent moves again.<br/> <br/> We refer to a legal move in \u2018championship mode\u2019 when the player places a disc outflanking one or more discs of the opposite color. As a result, those discs flip to your color.<br/> <br/> We refer to a legal move in \u2018simplified mode\u2019 when the player places a disc in a square contiguous to another one containing a disc, with the possibility of not having to flip the opponent\u2019s discs to consider this move valid.<br/> <br/> By making a valid move the discs which have been outflanked by a disc of an opposite color are flipped. We say that those discs lying on a straight line ( vertical, horizontal or diagonal ) are outflanked when they are enclosed by two of the opposite-colored disks.<br/> <br/> The match ends when no more legal moves are possible ( usually when the board is completely filled ), so that the player who has more discs of his/her color is the winner.<br/> <br/> This application is compatible with VOICEOVER for iOS.<br/> This application is compatible with ZOOM for iOS.<br/> Deaf and hear impaired people can play this game.<br/> This application does not require user registration or any additional payments.<br/> iPhone, iPod touch and iPad compatibility.<br/> <br/> Spanish and English languages supported.<br/><br/> *** Disclaimer ***<br/> <br/> This application uses Game Center services which are created by Apple.<br/> Game center services have their own user interface.
