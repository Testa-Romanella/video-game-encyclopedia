She infects the world in order to control the peoples minds and hearts, but two brave young souls rise up to her. Alas, they were no match, and when trying to escape, are cursed to lose what is most precious to them.</p>\n<p>Forming bonds with the witty and charming characters duality, you will soon find that the protagonists have a strong dynamic. Explore the intricacies of humanity in this light-hearted approach at philosophy through gaming.</p>\n<p>Throughout the story, you will visit 3 different towns with vastly different cultures and ways of life. The first, a desert town where the people are heavily spiritual in nature and live in a traditional fashion. The second, a frozen city with mixed values where the people live in eternal conflict with one another. And the last, a technocracy built on the edge of an active volcano, harvesting the energy it provides.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is best described as a new age pacman where you must maneuver around the different types of enemies with unique movement patterns and projectiles. Your character, constricted to a grid of purple tiles, must break all the blue infected tiles that are the manifestation of the witch's infestation of the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/8654458f80a855ff7ccc3078902c06ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Julien_Dupuis180"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
