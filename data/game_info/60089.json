Taking the 13th Minstory Game Production Competition organized by rpg.blue forum as an opportunity, the author spent one month creating this rebirth-themed game (to celebrate the nirvana of the forum). Instead of the traditional RM characters, the author designed original 6-frame &amp; 4-body proportion characters for this game and drew the characters in waiting status and all kinds of event status, which is new and refreshing. <br/> <br/><strong>Story Design </strong><br/>The players will play the decadent man Kirihara Shiro who rarely leaves home. He is unsociable and not very talkative. He has been muddling along without any aim. But a streak of light appears in the darkness. The players will set forth from the perspective of Kirihara Shiro and get the game going to explore the hidden secrets. <br/><br/><strong> Game Concept </strong><br/>Existence is a very important concept in the game, which directly affects where the game moves forward, and all NPCs\u2019 conversations and responses as well. If the existence is lower than a certain value, Kirihara Shiro\u2019s existence will be weakened. People around will ignore him and he will become visually transparent. When the existence is 0, then the game is over. <br/> <br/><strong>Game Ending </strong><br/>The game has three endings which can not change the game result. Only with the true end, can the player learn about the whole story.
