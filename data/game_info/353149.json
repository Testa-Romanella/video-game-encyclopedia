In this GM48 prototype you guide your birbs in a hostile wilderness as others jealous of your success try to destroy your home.</p>\n<p>As this is an unfinished prototype (and won't be finished unless overwhelming demand calls for it) you start with more resources than you need. Enjoy the gameplay, and if you hit a bug, well... have fun!</p>\n<p>This game was meant to be projected with a polar viewpoint, so you appeared to be walking around a globe which looped back on itself, which obviously was not finished.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right -&gt; A/D</li><li>Right Mouse Button -&gt; Interact/Attack</li><li>Escape -&gt; Quit</li><li>Delete -&gt; Restart</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1342344dcef6fb0ad26ccdc58c6118.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zen00"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
