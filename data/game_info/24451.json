Take off and pilot a biplane through rings along a \n      predetermined flight path, or drift serenely in a hang glider, catching \n      thermal currents to gain altitude. In either case, just be sure to stick \n      the landing. Strap on the rocket belt to blast your way around an \n      obstacle course. If that's not enough, reach maximum velocity as you \n      tackle a skydiving lesson at 3,800 feet. Complete specific objectives \n      within a set time limit to score points and obtain certification in \n      eight different lessons. Your goals will become more challenging, and \n      weather conditions will make controlling your vehicle more difficult as \n      you progress. If you succeed, you will be rewarded with the opportunity \n      to pilot an attack helicopter on a daring rescue mission.\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
