The game understands this desire and does everything to make it happen. Yes, there is a story in the game, but the main thing is that there are tremendous opportunities to see on the screen a bright consequence of all your destructive impulses.<br />\nYour small car or helicopter rushes around the locations, bringing down the streams of fire. The game reality is repeatedly and colourfully detonated from every touch. The game continually offers more and more appetising victims - cars, flying and swimming devices, limousines and buildings, which can be destroyed entirely or in pieces, inflicting wounds one by one or killing with one blow.<br />\nIt is clear that you are busy with all these mass destructions so you cannot observe the rules of the road - the game is favourably treated with the manner of your car to fly into a skid or to demolish fences not only by guns but also by bumpers. Navigation and management are also skillfully designed - and intended to not to distract you from the massacre.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2011-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T12:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/31b/31b1a1a45ad7103e52eed8ef658209a2.jpg", "website": "http://www.sega.co.uk/renegadeops/?t=EnglishUK", "rating": 2.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 226, "owned": 3485, "beaten": 104, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 103, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 318, "suggestions_count": 595, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 319, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Avalanche Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
