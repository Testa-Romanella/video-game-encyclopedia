One of these \"Cures\" had horrible side effects turning man into Z's. This cause Havoc and Chaos all over Miolhria.<br/><br/>Miolhriankind's last hope was left with these same scientist who continued to experiment with the Virus which changed so many of the Miolhrians into these Z's.<br/><br/>(As you can tell not all of the People of Miolhria were Genuses..)<br/><br/>After years of experimentation and luck a second cure was found but didn't work as they expected.<br/>Side effect from the second \"Cure\" allowed some people of Miolhr to Control Elemental Skills.<br/>These People were called Users. Elemental type(s) are Fire, Water, Poison and Ice.<br/><br/>(User are people with the ability to control Element Powers.)<br/><br/>After years of training, the Top Users created DoJo's to train <br/>and perfected their talents.<br/><br/>Years later Z's stated to build immunities and split off into 3 forms.<br/>Poison. Blazing. Earth!<br/><br/>This also allowed them to use these Skills.<br/><br/>At the same time User trained developed 2 New Skills. Physical <br/>and Tool. <br/>With these 6 Skills the World of Miolhria was balanced <br/>for a short time.<br/><br/>DoJo leaders stared to develop Dual User abilities. <br/>This was mostly through their training.<br/>This gave them the ability to control 2 Elements at once. <br/>For years DoJo leaders ruled the lands of Miolhria...<br/><br/>..until now...<br/><br/><br/><br/>(More to come)<br/><ul><li>600+ Items!(Coal, Shotgun, Mushroom Soup, First Aid and more.. )<br/></li><li>200 + Weapons!(Tools, Magic, Spears, Guns and more..)<br/></li><li>200+ Armor!
