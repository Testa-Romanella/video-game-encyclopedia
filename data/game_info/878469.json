The opponents are evil and all they think about is destroying you by touching your path and expanding their territory by conquering larger space.<br/><br/>If someone crosses your path before you fully enclose an area, you'll die. If you cross your own path, you'll die. If you hit a wall, you'll die.<br/><br/>You just need to swipe in different directions with arrow keys to move, and to claim a territory you just need to close the area. The game continues until you own the whole territory. To steal area from your opponents, you need to run through their territory and close as much area as possible. But, you should be very careful, as you just have One life and you\u2019ll lose it as soon as someone hits your tail.<br/><br/>Steal their entire territories and conquer the largest space.<br/><br/>Features at a Glance:<br/>\u2022 Easy to learn, hard to master<br/>\u2022 Smooth gameplay<br/>\u2022 Wonderful graphics with cool sound effects<br/>\u2022 Collect gems<br/>\u2022 Conquer the largest territory with your hero<br/>\u2022 Set different heroes for your profile<br/>\u2022 Fun for all ages<br/><br/>Conquering territories is really easy as you just need to close an area.
