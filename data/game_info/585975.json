{"id": 585975, "slug": "roll-a-ball-ra627", "name": "Roll a Ball (RA627)", "name_original": "Roll a Ball (RA627)", "description": "<p>The Game mechanics altered turn Roll A Ball into a much more difficult and mechanics-oriented game. Due to the player accelerating as they hold a movement key, handling of the ball becomes harder. Parts of the map are not spacious, and the platforms move slightly slower than the player, making both moving forward and standing still hard to do. There are basic puzzle elements in the way of a door. Overall, the game is more difficult and challenging for the player, as the intended objective is to make the player regret that they played the game.</p>\n<p>World Mod\r\n  </p>\n<p>1.) Added music, Zelda Breath of the Wild Shrine theme to fit the overall difficult and puzzle like setting.\r\n  </p>\n<p>2.) Changed Skybox and lighting to dusk (grabbed asset from unity store).\r\n  </p>\n<p>3.) Changed pickups to diamonds (grabbed asset from unity store) as well as moved their positions.\r\n  </p>\n<p>4.) Added more areas for the player to explore.\r\n  </p>\n<p>5.) Increased total pickups to 52.\r\n  </p>\n<p>6.) Added a timer so the player knows how much time they wasted.\r\n  </p>\n<p>7.) Added multiple platforms which move.\r\n  </p>\n<p>8.) Added text to give a tutorial using Text Mesh Pro.\r\n  </p>\n<p>9.) Added slopes to the eastern play area.\r\n  </p>\n<p>10.) Added a display to show how many falls the player has so they know how bad their movement is.\r\n  </p>\n<p>11.) Added door and pressure plate.\r\n  </p>\n<p>12.) Added section where player must go on thin beams.\r\n  </p>\n<p>13.) Added section where player must go through doors.\r\n  </p>\n<p>14.) Added a teleporter which brings player to new area.\r\n  </p>\n<p>15.) Added section which uses a combination of the other three sections.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Code Mod:\r\n  </p>\n<p>1.) Added mario coin noise whenever player pickups a pickup by playing the sound with every point earned.\r\n  </p>\n<p>2.) Added acceleration to the player by keeping track of how long they pressed down a key.\r\n  </p>\n<p>3.) Added code to reset the player when their y access goes under -10 by resetting their position back to when they spawned.\r\n  </p>\n<p>4.) Created a script for an automated platform to move the player with a script. The script asks for how many points it needs to move to before sliding to the position at a determined speed and with a determined delay.\r\n  </p>\n<p>5.) Added code to keep tract of how many times the player has fallen off the map by adding a counter whenever they fall below the level threshold.\r\n  </p>\n<p>6.) Added code that opens door when the player steps on a pressure plate and raises a door when the player steps on a pressure plate with a script. The pressure plate tells the door to move up 4 units whenever the player collides with the pressure plate.\r\n  </p>\n<p>7.) Added code that raises the door for a certain amount of time after the player steps on a pressure plate. Same as the point above but with a build in delay.\r\n  </p>\n<p>8.) Added code that changes the user\u2019s position values when they enter the teleporter. Works like respawning the player but instead it places them at set coordinates.\r\n  </p>\n<p>9.) Added code to keep tract of time spent playing the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>10.) Customized win text to comment on how many deaths or how long the player took.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b3a5dfd48583c9f79fbf63682ce0ddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RA627"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
