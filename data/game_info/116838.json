This game shows you how it will end and then you get to find out (or decide on) how it happens. If you want to full experience, you need to play through it a few times (you'll know when you've seen the \"real end\"), but it's really short so that shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>One ending. Multiple beginnings.</p><p>It was a design challenge that I set myself. I think that there's potential for an interesting game using this concept, but it would require a lot of work and would suffer with the same issues as any other branching-narrative game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-22T15:33:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f37aae7dafd95cac18f20bf695328b05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mighty CheBo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
