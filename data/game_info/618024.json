Through a minefield. Only an idiot would do something like that...</p>\n\n<p>Play as both the boat and the wakeboarder at once (or enlist a friend to control one part), linked together by a tether, as you zoom across the water in search of coins, and narrowly avoid (or fail to avoid) landmines! Only the wakeboarder can collect coins, but either can be blown up by a mine, so be careful.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I never got round to adding any music, so you'll either have to play your own, or use your imagination! Also unfortunately, the Mac version appears to be having issues running thanks to issues with exporting the game - the other two versions should hopefully work, and the Windows version has been tested and shown to work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/4083dc9f7b193add7f54e11e96f455c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Darquesse27"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
