Become scum of the sea, or become a hero in the eyes of the law. Things aren't black and white in the world of Pirate Souls.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Open World PvP &amp; Hardcore Game Design</strong><br/>This may be a turn off for some, but Pirate Souls is a very hardcore game. So take this as a word of warning... Absolute freedom when it comes to PvP also means a bad time for some with a low tolerance for being killed for no reason. But for others, it's just another reason to get stronger!<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Deep Character Customization in the right places</strong><br/>Choose your faction, join a crew and obtain a soul fruit power. Combined with thousands of equip-able items, no two seafarers will ever look or be the same. Pirate Souls is a game where you are encouraged to express yourself. Looking good doesn't cost you to lose fights.<br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T05:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/3034703ce62703a3ef44ffb353b59ab8.jpg", "website": "https://piratesouls.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diamond Soul"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hitspark"], "esrb_rating": null}
