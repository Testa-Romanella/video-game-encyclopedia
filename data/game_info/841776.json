Fever can be used to throw bullets at your opponent to slow them down (Fever Attack). The more fever you have, the stronger the attack is, but once used, your fever is reset.<ul><li>To be precise, for both Flandre and Remilia, there are four Fever Attack patterns. The strongest pattern appears at 100% fever.</li></ul></li><li>Health (green meter): As the Scarlet Sisters are vampires, they will take damage\u00a0 gradually outside shade. Hide under clouds to heal slowly. Being around Cirno heals you faster.</li><li>Umbrella (Meiling): When Meiling is with you, you will regenerate health very quickly, but she will leave once you get hit.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Panchamon: Art design</li><li>Einhope: Coloring</li><li>ChocolaMint: Gameplay/graphics programming, sound effects</li><li>Seeker: Menu programming</li><li>tami: Music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T12:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/12773fae556e5b60cb57c0c39abfb3a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Seeker_Eternity", "chocola-mint", "Einhope", "Panchamon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
