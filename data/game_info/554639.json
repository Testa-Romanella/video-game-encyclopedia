Needless to say the final result was nothing like what the original plan was.</p>\n<p>Lessons learned: Scriptable objects are very powerful and can be used for variety of purposes. in\u00a0 this project I learned that they can incredible at allowing for modular design. Each box spawn patter contained in a scriptable object, which are are then fed into an array. This allowed me to mix and match them fairly easily and put a level together by just popping in different spawn patterns. I can see how they can also be very useful in procedural generation and I might try to use them for that in the next project.</p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>2020 was rough year to say the least. My personal game development progress has been in a ditch for a while. In an attempt to fix that, I am going to try and release a game every month. The goal is to spend at least a few hours each week and have a game of some kind ready by the end of the month while working\u00a0 on whatever else.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3f/f3fb2720ed034e43c4593e6d7e19dbd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dilem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
