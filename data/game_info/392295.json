The difficulty lies in the fact that you will travel simultaneously on two parallel worlds. Special teleporters will help you with this. But be careful! Where you enter the teleport depends on where you find yourself! But do not be so careless, this walk will not be easy. You often have to rack your brains to figure out how to get to one place or another.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/748c394d681983a45bdf8ee5056d40fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Freshtrax"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freshtrax"], "esrb_rating": null}
