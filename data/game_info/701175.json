Control the states of matter to traverse through a large open environment with various objectives. Change to water to leap from puddle to puddle and dash into enemies! Slam the ground and slide around as an ice block. Float into normally unreachable areas as water vapor! Traverse the lush pond to water the dying plants and help them grow.</p><p>Team Members:</p>\n<p>Kyle Grenier - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Anthony Pollos - Designer</p>\n<p>Tristan - Programmer / UI Designer</p>\n<p>Avery Macke - Environment Artist</p>\n<p>Michael Gonzalez - Character Artist</p><p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move character</p>\n<p>Space Bar - Jump</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Swap state of matter</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p><p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>- Transforming into the liquid state then quickly leaving the water keeps you in the liquid state even outside of the water.
