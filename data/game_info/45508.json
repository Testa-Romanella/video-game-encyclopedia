When everything is destructible, the choice is yours. <br/><br/>Jarheads is a fast-paced tactical shooter with fully-destructible environments, comprising of a 50 mission single-player (or two-player online co-op) campaign and a separate online multiplayer experience for up to 8 players with a variety of explosive game modes.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Each mission is designed to be completed in just a few minutes, but building up to mission success may require many tries as you probe the enemy for weaknesses and find the optimal path to your objectives. Make use of grenades, rockets, tanks and choppers to obliterate enemy structures, vehicles and infantry. Leaderboards for each mission let you compete for the fastest times.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Shortly after launch, the Jarheaditor (Jarheads Editor) will be made available with full Steam Workshop integration. Create your own maps and bundle them up in a Campaign or multiplayer map pack for others to play. The editor supports the MagicaVoxel .vox format allowing you to create your own prefabs to paint into your maps.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f06061be3db05fe7a7c0af470f514de.jpg", "website": "http://jarheads-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gareth Williams"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Gareth Williams"], "esrb_rating": null}
