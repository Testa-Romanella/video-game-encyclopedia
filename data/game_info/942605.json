The camera will get stuck if your character doesnt go high enough in the next camera. To remedy this you can just jump back into the camera and it should start switching again. If your still having trouble with it you can reset (the games pretty short)</p>\n<p>2. Sometimes the snail will spawn in the floor or two snails will spawn. if the snail spawns in the floor, if you stand in the right place you can still use superjump. the snail is not required to beat the game so if it happens you can reset if you'd like. if two snails spawn we can call it a \"feature\".</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy! :)</p>\n<p>Credit to: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/ for the asset pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T17:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49cd755bb02e827d1e66032ecd33739d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beachbum709"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
