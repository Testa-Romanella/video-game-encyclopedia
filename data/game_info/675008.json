Gizmo is your personal assistant android\u00a0 who's here to help you overcome whatever you're going through. Sadly, this android is only for the creator's son, who is going through depression after what has happened. Fun fact: This game is a backstory of the main character of a animated series I'm working on (not Gizmo). So, sit back, enjoy, and watch Gizmo play you his past memories.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e56e734b3469f864769111ca5b50e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["daramut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
