(Nes Box Art Jam 11/29/15)", "description": "<p>This was created for the NES box art jam, I decided to use the box art from 'Adventures Of Lolo' to create this game. I have not played that game before, so I thought it would be fun!<br/><br/>It was my first game jam, and I have learned a lot from it. I still wish I could add on a little bit more to this game, but I think it is in a very complete form.<br/><br/>It is based around the old style games, I only used 16 by 16 tiles, and used only 4 colours on each tile (even transparency counts as a colour!) I also made sure to use the nes colour pallet :D<br/><br/>I also only used 8 bit sound effects, and played around with SDL_Mixer, and made it only play low quality sounds as output. (No matter what audio file I use).<br/><br/>I created the game as a platformer, because when I was looking at the box art, I sort of felt that this is that type of game. I am not sure if I was correct or not, but that's the whole point of the box art jam, isn't it?<br/><br/>Anyway, there are a few things I would have added if I had more time like more levels, more art, more enemies and more characters, but no matter what, I feel like I have added enough to make this game pretty awesome.<br/><br/>I have used my own engine for this game, it runs with OpenGL, Box2D, SDL, SDL_mixer, and my own font rendering library :D<br/><br/>It was a lot of work and dedication, and I really had a great time making it, so I hope everyone who plays it will enjoy it as much as I have! :D<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c13d36eb887ab78d6a581a4d7143bbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
