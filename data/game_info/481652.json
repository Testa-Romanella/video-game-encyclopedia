Player has to follow the write ups given in magazine called 'World Trends'\u00a0 while designing which is shown before the design session. After the design session the dress is brought to a showcase , where you will have a crowd to inspect your design. You will be promoted to next level if the crowd love your design , so its important to follow the trend. Dresses cannot be modified once it is applied, thus the rewind button comes in handy.
