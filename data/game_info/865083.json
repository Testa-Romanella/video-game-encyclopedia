You try to keep your momentum and accelerate while avoiding bumping the monuments. There is <strong>no speed limit</strong>.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> The goal is to <strong>collect as many orbs as possible</strong> within <strong>5 minutes</strong>. You'll see yourself <strong>improving really quickly</strong> as you get used to the mechanics. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There are <strong>multiple game modes</strong> with their own dedicated <strong>Leaderboards</strong>: <br/><ul><li> <strong>Original</strong>: The orbs spawn in the <strong>original positions</strong>. You can <strong>memorize</strong> the positions and perfect your route. All entries in the Leaderboard are equal.<br/></li><li> <strong>Random</strong>: The orbs spawn in <strong>random positions</strong>. There is <strong>no memorization</strong> so you need to improve your base <strong>movement skills and strategy</strong>. All entries in the Leaderboard are different. <br/></li><li> <strong>Weekly</strong>: Everyone plays with the <strong>same orb positions for the entire week</strong>. The leaderboard <strong>resets every Monday</strong> .<br/></li><li> <strong>Zen Mode</strong>: No timer, <strong>no stress</strong>, no Leaderboard; just <strong>chill and enjoy</strong>!</li></ul></li></ul><br/><ul><li> You can also compete in the separate <strong>Friends Leaderboard</strong>.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> There is a <strong>rank system</strong> with 14 ranks from 40 orbs up to 150 orbs. After 40 orbs, your <strong>Kunai</strong> starts changing color and material. At 100 orbs, you get the <strong>Flame Kunai</strong> and above 130, your rope turns into a <strong>lightning beam</strong>. Among the players above 150 orbs collected, only the best one gets the <strong>\"Ascendant\"</strong> rank.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> The movement mechanic is custom, hand-tailored for <strong>grappling hook</strong> and <strong>air-strafing</strong> like in Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike. But it's more <strong>intuitive</strong> because unlike in those games, you hold the forward key while air-strafing, and you can also move in all directions in the air without air-strafing. With this, you can micro-adjust your movement to pick up the orbs easily. There is also <strong>auto-bunnyhopping</strong> when you hold the jump key, so you don't need to focus on timing your jumps. Instead, focus on your route and swings. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> The <strong>replays</strong> in the leaderboard have video player kinds of controls, like a timeline, play speed, and pause for ease of use. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> Physics runs at <strong>125 ticks</strong> (8 milliseconds) to make sure the movement is <strong>smooth and detailed</strong>. The replays are recorded as <strong>lossless</strong>, and high quality at the same rate.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> You can <strong>put your own meme</strong> image to the orbs, and use your own sounds for orb pickup, hook throwing and hook landing to customize your experience.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> The HUD in the game is made clean and <strong>minimalistic</strong> to make sure you see it only when you need to. It's <strong>not blocking your view</strong>. You can also turn specific ones off in the HUD settings, and change the <strong>crosshair and orb outline colors</strong>. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There is a mesmerizing <strong>day and night cycle</strong> in the sky. This creates beautiful dynamic lighting and shadows during the run. You can <strong>customize</strong> the day length and the hour the day starts. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There are lots of fun <strong>lifetime and run-based stats</strong> like <strong>\"how many orbs did you collect\"</strong>, <strong>\"how many times did you bump\"</strong> or <strong>\"how many kilometers did you travel\"</strong> in total. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There is a <strong>guide</strong> within the game, <strong>full of short videos</strong> where you can learn the deeper mechanics. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There are lots of <strong>achievements</strong> to challenge yourself.</li></ul><br/><ul><li> The game is quite <strong>light and optimized</strong> to run smoothly on older machines while still looking pretty. </li></ul><br/><ul><li> There is an option, <strong>\"Null-Cancelling Movement\"</strong> which is a famous script in Source games. When it's off, just like in any other game, holding left and right keys makes you stop. When it's on, you move in the last-pressed direction. This allows quicker and cleaner direction switches.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T06:34:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/1475c0a522ce91e0b92e7c777fba08f1.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/naezith", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tolga Ay"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tolga Ay"], "esrb_rating": null}
