That autumn air. Those spooky sounds.<br/><br/>Welcome to <strong>Slaughterlands</strong>, the spooky district of the Vienna Gardens Theme Park! Guests enter, but do they leave?<br/>The answer is yes. But for the sake of spookiness.... no.<br/><br/>This is your second year with the park. Enough to know that your co-workers are all nuts, management constantly tries to shut you down.... and there are actual, real ghosts roaming the grounds. Ages ago, Vienna Gardens was the site of an ancient battle between feuding kings and queens, some of which still reside here. Which is kinda bad for business, as one of the exiled ghouls is busy raising an army to wipe Slaughterlands (and Vienna Gardens) off the map!<br/><br/>So now you have to try not to go out of business as well as train various skeletons and stuff for war. Usual minimum wage stuff.<br/><br/><ul><li> Manage both your team of Scare Experts.... as well as the various ghosts!</li></ul><ul><li> Build an army to counter the encroaching army of the Zombie Battlemage!</li></ul><ul><li> Help guests with your team's skills! Fight bad guys in turn based combat!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T05:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/2704062bce950cb3bfefdc02ed19eb7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Developmen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Developmen"], "esrb_rating": null}
