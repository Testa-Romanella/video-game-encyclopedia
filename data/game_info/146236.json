Use your skills to <br/>transport yourself through portals to the different parallel universes and utilize them to overcome obstacles and <br/>master puzzles. You will see that the parallel universes are quite similar to your home universe - in fact, <br/>they only differ in one key physical aspect from each other. <br/>These little differences will aid you through the game. However, the portal that transports you into the different <br/>universes is unstable and can't keep you in there for too long - so hurry! The objective of every level simply is to find the exit (the orange floor tile).<br/><br/>Created during the Game Jam Event at the Technische Universitaet Darmstadt - Multimedia Communications Lab (KOM) <br/><br/>The following assets were not created by us but have been used to save us some time: <br/><br/>http://opengameart.org/content/keyboard-keys <br/>by the author \"TRBRY\" with the CC-BY 3.0 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) <br/>and modified to show different keys of our controls</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["maxrebo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
