This game puts you in a specific situation: a conversation about a relationship in stalemate where your partner is trying to tell you something.

Unfortunately, recognizing open input from the player also requires knowing the grammar rules of the player\u2019s language. We are a small team, and converting the system to support more languages would be a tremendous amount of work that we couldn\u2019t take on. If the game proves successful, however, we\u2019ll consider this possibility.</p>\n\n\n<p>\r\n\tConsider also to follow us here, on \r\n\tTwitter and/or Facebook and subscribe to our newsletter. <br/></p>\r\nReviews\r\n<p>\u201c...this is an extremely deep dive into a moral dilemma \u2013 and one with more than a little resonance for role-reversed human fears\u201d\r\nRock Paper Shotgun</p>\n<p>\u201cWith tons of different paths to clear, Don't Make Love puts up a challenge for players that may seem deeper than a couple of bugs fighting instinct.
