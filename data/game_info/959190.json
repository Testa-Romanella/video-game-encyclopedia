So choose your cards wisely, as the power-ups are not shared and the merchant only has one card of each one. A good team composition will surely make completing your main objective easier! <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Team members:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Fabi\u00e1n\u00a0Diaz</li><li>Gaspar Ricci</li><li>Felipe Torralba</li></ul>\n<p><em>Blue Penguin Games</em>.<em> An assignment for CC5409 \"Multiplayer Video Game Workshop\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T23:18:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goose", "fabiandiaz", "Ulvehage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
