She is also a pianist for her former orphanage but she\u2019s not really that good. Actually she really sucks at both playing piano and cooking. One day she meets a bunch of dudes who happen to have the magical \u201cFalga\u201d powers of famous classical pianists. An evil force called the Forgotten Apostle comes and tries to steal all the sound from the town because of the \u201cevil noise\u201d that\u2019s coming from the darkness inside the performers. Most average people are affected but Lied is safe \u2013 so now she joins the musical academy to work with everyone to help restore music back to Shall and defeat the Forgotten Apostle.</p>\n<p>[From Hinano&#39;s blog]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-31T18:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22ad2c707ebbfe9900ba62457a731933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PS Vita"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
