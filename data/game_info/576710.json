{"id": 576710, "slug": "end-matter", "name": "End Matter", "name_original": "End Matter", "description": "<p>End Matter is a hyper-stylized real time space battle simulator created by your\u00a0friendly, buzzword-abusing indie dev next door who's really happy that you're considering\u00a0investing your hard earned money into\u00a0funding his horrible, horrible coffee addiction. But hey,\u00a0that'll at least guarantee you half an evening of fun on the couch kicking some aliens in the nuts while wondering whether it was <em>really</em> necessary to blend a casual strategy game with a motherfucking dating sim. It's just that one level tho, promised. Well, anyways...</p>\n<p>At its very core End Matter is an arena-like strategy game set in space: short\u00a0and action-packed (<em>puke</em>) rounds of conquering new planets, defending them from enemy players, outgrowing their fleets and showing them who's intergalactic boss. On top of its core game play loop the game experiments with some unique\u00a0game modes and dabbles into a bunch of weird genre blends. Ever wondered what 4 in a row with planets, space ships and black hole guns looks like? You'll find out right after seducing the thicc planet next door that has a secret love affair with an AI named Steve.</p>\n\n<ul><li>40\u00a0levels leaving you wondering whether it's <em>kinda, sorta art</em>\u00a0or if the dev is really just fucking you over.</li><li>11 even more pretentious game modes for you to unlock.</li><li>11 weapons. Also unlockable. One of them is a black hole gun tho. Just saying.</li><li>Infinite\u00a0fun playing all the above over and over again in custom quick matches.</li><li>Umm...</li><li>And a tutorial.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing my game. Reach out on twitter if you have feedback or if you just wanna talk games. That's what we're all here for after all :)</p>\n<p>rio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T04:35:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54eeaf2d3d164044ce5f30ee33d82a7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Rio", "Mario Koenig"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Mario Koenig"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
