Keep the town alive by providing enough energy to satisfy its demand and avoid the reactor from overheating and thus exploding.</p>\n<p>This game was developed in roughly 48 hours with 2 people working on it (Kenneth \"KennuX\" Ellersdorfer and Daniele Marotta).</p>\n<p>Some gameplay information (we ran out of time to make an interactive tutorial):<br/>- The game is paused initially, you can control the game speed at the top-left controls</p>\n<p>- Buy parts from the store by clicking them in the store and placing them in the grid<br/>- Right-click parts in the grid to delete them (NO REFUND!)<br/>- Click parts in the grid to move them, click again to re-place</p>\n<p>- You will loose if the reactor explodes (a cell becomes too hot [&gt; 200\u00b0C]) or you do not meet the energy demand for longer than 20 seconds (this scales with game speed setting)</p>\n<p>Some gotcha's:<br/>- I can't place an item from the store in the grid!<br/>-&gt; Do you have enough money to buy it (sorry, we ran out of time and there is no good user feedback)</p>\n\n<p>Sourcecode:\u00a0https://github.com/kennux/LD46</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c86c651ce8aac0e4b4d7627b2189143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kennux"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
