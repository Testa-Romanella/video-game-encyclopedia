Enemy mouths will try to eat you, so make sure to slide away from them with your greasy crust. Better yet, teach them a lesson by\u00a0shooting some pepperonis at them. If you get past all the obstacles, you get to be part of an entire pizza again--no more loneliness!</p>\n<p>This game is mostly just a prototype at this point. If you liked it even a little bit, let me know in the comments. Maybe I'll keep working on it just for you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4316d14a10dd423c299884f6f9f605a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Garbled Warble"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
