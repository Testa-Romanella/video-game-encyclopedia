It's finally here, and with more updates to come, this game will stay here for a while. I improved on a lot of the flaws from the beta, but I had to remove some features due to limitations. But hopefully you'll still find the fun in it. Eventually I will add back the missing features, and some new ones along side new levels with them.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah these are kind of important so the basics are like this:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>You can you the space bar to jump if you please.</p>\n<p>Press down\u00a0or the \"S\" key to fall through platforms.</p>\n<p>R to reset the level if you get stuck.</p>\n<p>M to mute the music (but why would you?)</p>\n<p>X or press the x in the bottom left to go to menu.</p>\n<p>Also you have a double jump, use it wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>REVIEWS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Good/10\"</em>\u00a0- MagesQuest Beta World Record Holder\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Pretty good Platformer\"</em> - Unbiased fan\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Subscribe to WaterMaster67\"</em> - WaterMaster67</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The characters, the sprites and the game were all made by me.</p>\n<p>The amazing song was made by @Ar2OO.</p>\n<p>Level 19 was designed by https://kingofcold.itch.io/.</p>\n<p>Go sub to me here\u00a0so I can do more cool stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE NOTES:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is empty for now but it'll have a use eventually.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac8767b18e486320f0dffbf5088473f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gammactic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
