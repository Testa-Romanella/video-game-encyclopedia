R. 2 develops in an alternate reality, on the site of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The territory that became extinct after the 1986 accident was taken over by a group of scientists who studied the hypothesis of the Earth's information field-the noosphere.</p>\n<p>In the network of X-laboratories deployed by them on the territory of the CHZO, the existence of the noosphere was confirmed, work was carried out on promising weapons, the ability of living beings to generate directed psi radiation was discovered, biological and technical psi-emitters were created that zombified all those approaching them.</p>\n<p>The main task was to break into the noosphere and subdue it. To do this, Generators were built a kilometer from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant units, and scientists united in a collective mind \"O-consciousness\". However, on April 12, 2006, the experiment failed, and after it, the energy of the noosphere poured into the CHZO (the first outburst), changing the physical laws (anomalies and artifacts). Over time, monsters appeared in the Zone: some mutated, some had a man-made origin.</p>\n<p>Trying to stop the spread of pruschey from the Infection Zone, the military surrounded it around the perimeter with barbed wire and minefields. Attempts by the authorities to find out what happened continued throughout the following years, but inevitably ended in failure. But stalkers-daredevils-illegal immigrants who secretly made their way into the Zone-were more successful. They brought out almost magical artifacts, talked about anomalies, and told stories about encounters with deadly mutants.</p>\n<p>Over time, one of the stalkers named Shooter or Marked (the protagonist of S. T. A. L. K. E. R. and the protagonist of the addons) still managed to find out the background of the formation of the Zone and find out about the \"O-consciousness\". Not only this, but also other knowledge about survival in the Zone, he passed on to the state, becoming a consultant at the established institute for the study of the Chernobyl Anomalous zone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:18:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc86959738a45ec57f519e965ce9a423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trideOfficalicMester"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
