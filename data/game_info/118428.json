About halfway through the jam, he decided to take a break from games and do some urban exploration of an abandonded facility a few hours away from his appartment.</p>\n<p>Harvey found a CD and a note addressed to him in one of the abandoned buildings. I know this because he later tweeted a picture of it at me accusing me of planting it as a joke.</p>\n<p>A day later, I heard he wasn't responding to people, so I went to see if he was doing alright. His apartment appeared untouched when I arrived, sans a glitched game screen and a sheet of paper saying \"James upload this game.\" I didn't want to upload it, but I couldn't shake off the whispering I heard in the dark and the feeling that I was being watched. This went on for a full day until I finaly caved in and uploaded it. I don't feel as afraid in the dark anymore, but I will never open this game.</p>\n<p>I uploaded some footage I got from his phone, and a few relevant pictures here. I just want to make sure people know what they're getting into. I'm afraid that if I try to hide the game, the shadows will come back, and I don't want to end up like Harvey.</p>\n<p><strong>Last bits of info on Harvey:</strong></p>\n<p>I linked the game's webpage to Harvey's page as I feel that's the most relevant. And I refer to whatever was stalking me as 'shadows' because I found several links to this site in his browser history:http://www.shadowpeople.org/</p>\n<p><strong>His profile on SeemPoint:</strong> http://seeminglypointless.com/hhj/</p>\n<p><strong>New information since the game's upload:</strong></p>\n<p>Since \"Mr. Kitty Saves the World\" was upload on GameJolt, it has been featured, posted on a few blogs, as well as in some forums. In other words, it has been played more than once. At first, I wondered if I had imagined it all. Maybe Harvey did just leave. Maybe the shadows were all in my head and the voices just paranoia. But then I was contacted by several game survivors, people who received similar instructios to what I have gotten. The most shocking example was brought to my attention by Nik Sudan who left Mr. Kitty in his downloads folder and woke up with this on his arm:https://twitter.com/NikSudan/status/357877283018665985/photo/1</p>\n<p>In case you wonder if it was a prank pulled by a friend, he lives alone.</p>\n<p>In terms of gameplay, from what I've seen of other people playing it, it seems that Mr. Kitty Saves the World is a finite runner.</p>\n<p><strong>As a warning:</strong> If you play this game and are contacted by whatever created it, <strong>please be willing to disapear</strong>. I know this sounds awful, but it has become extremely apparent that by following their instructions and not just disapearing, the game will continue to claim more lives. I am now sure that Harvey was doing the world a favor by letting them take him. Whereas I've hurt humanity by giving in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738bf2df488248744659e3fe96bb3534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Earl Cox III"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
