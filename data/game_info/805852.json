This game is designed entirely by me which you could probably tell by its poor drawings.

This project deepened Unity concepts and helped me advance my\u00a0game development journey.\u00a0</p><p>Credits:\u00a0</p><p>Main theme - Theo JT</p><p>SFX - FreeSound.org users\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209e2a4f33ab1a3d1b51d77b18ce1b3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dantebajarias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
