The Neutron Wars have been and gone, taking with them most of the population of Earth. Those who survive live out their lives under an artificial sky, trapped within giant biodomes and bathed in the purple aura of a protective field. Every word, every thought is monitored by The Company.\u00a0Dissent is punishable by death, which is kind of ironic, since death is exactly what most people pray for.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fuel reserves are exhausted. What little power The Company provides comes from offworld, shipped in from the vast Empyreum mines of LV13. But the mines are at the center of an endless war, a meaningless conflict from which no-one returns alive. It is a war we cannot win, and yet a war we must not lose.\r\n</em>\n<em>When Kantrell Adams is forcibly conscripted to the mines, his family faces the prospect of losing everything - until mysterious startup Rewind Inc. offers a solution. If he backs up his mind to their systems, his wife can have it restored into a clone when he dies. The same husband in a younger body, crafted to her own specifications. Everybody wins.\r\n</em>\n<em>But those at the top have their eyes on Rewind Inc. - and they may have an entirely different fate mapped out for Kantrell...</em>\n</p>\n<p>Rewind: The Empyreum War is the first chapter in an ongoing science fiction epic based on a 12 hour script I wrote a few years ago which, lets be honest, would've bankrupted any production company who tried to produce it! I've been a software developer since the 80s, both in terms of games programming and business database software design and development, and I also have a background in graphics design so a visual novel seems much more up my street - albeit, a visual novel on an epic scale.</p>\n<p>The game is going to take a while to complete, being based on such a long script with many twists and turns, so I've decided to release it here in stages so that you can keep up with development, and also on Patreon where I can offer extra perks for subscribers. Rewind is a science fiction comedy-drama with a dark heart - a story which will keep you on the edge of your seat until you fall off laughing. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll gasp with surprise at every unexpected twist - and if you don't, then a couple of droids from the Department of Corrections\u00a0will be around to find out why.</p>\n<p>This first release contains the first few scenes from the game, and is definitely still in development. It contains a full soundtrack and sound effects as well as the complete story so far, but there are definitely things I wish to improve in future releases in areas such as the inventory. Look at this as the first stage of a rather large project which will evolve and improve with time. I do, however, intend to complete each stage as quickly as possible as I go along - so each release will have full sound and voice acting will be added pretty soon afterwards. You won't have to wait for years for a finished product with months of gameplay before I even start adding sound and voice.</p>\n<p>Thank you also for any support you can give me at this early stage - I hope to make this project my main source of income over time so that I can put all my time into it, and I've just invested in a powerful Nvidia PC which will just sit there rendering images for the game, so it would be quite nice if I\u00a0eventually made some of that investment back. I'll still continue to develop the game whatever happens as the Rewind universe has become something of a labour of love for me, but it would be nice to be able to afford to dedicate all my time to New Amsterdam...</p>\n<p>ALWAYS remember, the COMPany Loves You.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T14:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d4bd03b769d60bac33ee85f9ac77cbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Simon Burford"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
