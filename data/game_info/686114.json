I don't know why the 2nd level isn't loading maybe is to big? I don't know at least you have 2 game modes!</p>\n<p>The game is about a ball and you have to avoid enemies which are the squares, now this game isn't the best but for a first game I say I done something amazing. This game took me 72hrs to complete ( 3 Days ) and most of the code is my own, but here and there I copy / pasted someone's else. This game is definitely not the best game but if you are a coder comment on what I could've done to improve the game!</p>\n<p>Big Thanks to Brackey's for the tutorial video, I did get the copy some of the features but then added features to make this game unique and not just a copy of his game. I do plan to join some Jam's so hopefully new games will be out!</p>\n<p>Follow my YT I will start making some more games and posting it on there!</p>\n<p>( I should've been revising for my mocks but instead I made a game lol )</p>\n<p><strong>Game Tips:</strong></p>\n<p>[Space] In level Mode will speed you up</p>\n<p>[A + D] To Move Left And Right</p>\n<p>[E] to go back to main menu</p>\n<p>My Channel:\u00a0Kracoz - YouTube</p>\n<p>Brackey's Channnel:\u00a0Brackeys - YouTube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c71762229f98bd6892c1741c503bcd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kracoz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
