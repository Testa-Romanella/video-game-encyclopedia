{"id": 573272, "slug": "all-inn", "name": "All-Inn", "name_original": "All-Inn", "description": "\"Whatever you would do for money\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as a young lady who is as a sole heir of an innkeepers' family and is living in a rather small village somewhere near the edge of a medieval kingdom. The latest news say: a prince of the kingdom is riding all over his domain, revising every corner of it and unleashing his wrath on whatever town that is not worthy his blessing. Your hometown is on the line, and so you have to build a residential palace there before the prince arrives so you can avoid being rejected by His Majesty. You only have as much as 2 weeks, some tenants who could help you and you wits... if you have any. Good luck.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"All-Inn\" offers harsh, unforgiving innkeeper experience, because who said that holding an entire inn full of people is easy?<br/>While trying not to die in a number of ways, keep the following in mind:<br/>- An entire inn and its surroundings for you to control.<br/>- Various tenants you can lend a room for staying to for a smaller fee, in exchange for them helping you with your daily activities. Now isn't that convenient?<br/>- A good number of things to handle: manage your budget, the mental and physical state of you and your tenants, ensure the integrity and safety of your town.<br/>- Risk as the core feature of the game: gamble on lives, lose your sanity, get broke, all by accident.<br/>- Your time is limited. Each action requires time, so plan your schedule accordingly.<br/>- Several endings for you to witness, each triggered by choices you make.<br/><br/>Can a small innkeeper be granted the blessing of a prince? Perhaps. It's only up to you to make it happen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T04:10:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e95b496aca256b7bdc52462300b7eee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heart Art Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Heart Art Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
