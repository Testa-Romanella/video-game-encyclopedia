{"id": 377823, "slug": "wargs", "name": "Wargs", "name_original": "Wargs", "description": "Wargs is an indie MOBA with game mechanics that are inspired by massively multiplayer games like Perpetuum and Eve. WARNING! Steep learning curve ahead, but you'll be just fine if you played one of those previously mentioned titles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core mechanics of Wargs revolve around capturing towers. To capture a tower, you must kill or clear all enemy players and guardian NPCs around it. Then you need to stay close to the tower until its timer has counted down to 0. The match is won when one of the teams captures the main enemy tower (the one closest to the enemy base).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T02:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95e69f49f1af110becc857962f8b2193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoopoe"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Hoopoe"], "esrb_rating": null}
