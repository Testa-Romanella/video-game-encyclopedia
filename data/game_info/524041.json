The blue cubes are the player controllable units, the red cubes are the enemies.\u00a0 When a blue cube is cyan, they have been selected for use by the player and when a red cube turns cyan, they are the enemy that the currently selected player cube is targetting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player cube's have two actions, attack or move. Attacking costs 2 action points and movement costs 1.\u00a0As a result, players characters can move and then attack, or they can attack but not move afterwards. The enemy characters will function the same, but they have a trick up their sleeves if the player characters bunch up. Click the end turn button when you have nothing left to do in your turn!</p>\n<p>The controls can be seen below...<br/><br/>WASD / Mouse Movement: Move camera<br/>Scroll\u00a0Wheel: Zoom in/out<br/>Left Mouse:\u00a0Select player controllable unit<br/>Right Mouse: Move selected unit to chosen square<br/>Space:\u00a0Enable Attack\u00a0Selection<br/>Tab: Cycle through enemies in sight<br/>Enter: Execute attack on selected enemy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T07:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1feab531ef2ad64d072303b9a2b596c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RyanHolmes"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
