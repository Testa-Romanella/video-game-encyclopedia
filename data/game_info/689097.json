Z to jump and X to dash and arrow keys to move around and control dash direction. There are two game modes to choose from:\u00a0arena, where you fight an endless horde of mosquitoes; and the tower, where you must reach the top. By the way, you will see an enticing looking\u00a0chest whenever you complete at least 5-hit combos. These were supposed to provide upgrades which I\u00a0haven't gotten around to implement and probably never will.</p>\n<p>This is the first game of my series of small prototype-like games. It was done in less than two weeks. A very simple concept meant to learn how to use GameMaker, the engine I chose for this series of small games. Next games will hopefully be more interesting as I\u00a0feel more comfortable with the engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:04:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee30c870ac432957ba5fafb9aae814ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diegzumillo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
