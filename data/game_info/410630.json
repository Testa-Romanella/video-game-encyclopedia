The theme is\u00a0Fun In A Blank Room. It\u00a0probably took me\u00a0more than 3 hours to make this, though I don't know for sure because I forgot to pause the timer during a longer break.</p>\n<p>You can use your mouse to paint rather large pixels on a blank canvas. To do this, click the left button to place a pixel where indicated or hold it down and move the mouse around to keep painting.\u00a0Use your mouse wheel or left/right arrow keys to cycle through the possible colours. The active colour is indicated by the cross hair thingy. There are not many, though each colour does something different. Play around and find out what the colours do and how they interact with another!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0wanted to include some music, but in the end I just barely was able to meet the deadline, so please play one of your favourite relaxing tunes while you create your painting and watch it becoming alive!</p>\r\nLicences\r\n<p>This game was made in\u00a0Godot.\u00a0See also the licence information included in the downloadable archives and linked on the web version's landing page for details.</p><p>Cover art font by\u00a0Severin Meyer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:20:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b774f909626273cdf81050529efa89f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GreenBeakCrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
