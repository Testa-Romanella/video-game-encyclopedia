I built this environment for use in my \"VR Tour\" series on YouTube where I take a look at real world locations in anime mainly using Google Earth VR. \u00a0You can see the segment I used it for here at 16:14. Check out the series if you enjoy this sort of thing!</p>\n<p>To begin playing, just walk through the wall of the title cube. Pink  spheres indicate screenshot locations. Sprites are one-sided so stand  near a sphere first and then look around from there. Moving up/down only  works when you're not moving. (I couldn't be bothered to figure out a  better way to do it.)\r\n</p>\n<p>Since it has already served its\u00a0purpose, it is already \"feature complete\" and probably won't be updated but I can't promise it will work on anything aside from a Valve Index since that's all I have and I'm not a game dev. Sorry if you can't get it working.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>\"Icebreaker Model A\" by Ario H (3D Warehouse.com), \"Two Hands\" by Gary G (3D Warehouse.com), \"Imperial Penguin\" by Felis Chaus (Unity Asset Store), alterations to icebreaker model and all other work by SilentCaay, A Place Further than the Universe by Madhouse and Kadokawa Pictures.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T07:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed23cdbc270f4926d2040072804bc2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SilentCaay"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
