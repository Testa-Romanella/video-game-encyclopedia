Prepare for an arcade delight with tight controls, refreshing game mechanics, cracking retro art and a terribly hip chiptune soundtrack.</p>\n<p><strong>SUPER BREAD BOX</strong> is an official conversion of the 2010 indie classic SUPER CRATE BOX for the C64 computer, developed by Commodore enthusiast Paul Koller and published on cartridge by Vlambeer and RGCD.
