Every round you will draw 5 cards and have 10 seconds to decide what to do and how best to use them. Once decided, the character will perform those actions in the order you chose. As you explore, you will collect additional cards. But beware, as with all deck builders, a bloated deck can hinder your victory.</p>\n<p>Note: \"Combat\" in this game is merely moving in the direction of the enemy. If you have an enemy in the tile directly above the Player Character, then attempting to move onto that tile counts as an \"Attack\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97d7d6a7498a47ef8f589b38f7ac2ce7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dudefro3600"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
