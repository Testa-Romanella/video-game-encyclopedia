The game takes place in a rectangular arena, with the gates of heaven and hell at its ends. By standing on the side of good, you must protect the gates of heaven, through which the monsters escaping from hell want to penetrate. You have several defensive structures at your disposal with different properties. You buy defensive structures for gold and then place them in a selected place on the battlefield. You will receive additional gold after each round. Buildings can also be resold by recovering some gold. Enemies are divided into categories: land and air. Land monsters are slow but very resistant. You can control their march by properly positioning your military buildings. However, do not think that it is possible to close the way completely! Air monsters do not show that much resistance, but they are fast and you have no influence on their flight way. When a monster will get into to heaven's gate, you will lose some defense points. When you lose them all, the game is over and you will be judged. Show strategy and creativity, beat your own records, which are on the list of your best results.</p>\n\n<p>Control</p>\n<p>Left mouse button - buying, building, selling, God\u2019s thunder.</p>\n<p>Right mouse button pressed - moving the camera on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Mouse scroll - camera zoom in and out.</p>\n<p>Keyboard arrow keys - same as the right mouse button.</p>\n<p>ESC - when pressed at any time in the game, it pauses the game and allows you to resume or return to the main menu and check your best scores list.</p>\n\n<p>Minimum hardware and system requirements.</p>\n<p>Operating system: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10</p>\n<p>Processor: 2.0 Ghz</p>\n<p>Memory: 4 GB RAM</p>\n<p>Graphics: nVidia GeForce GTX 260 / Radeon HD 4850</p>\n<p>DirectX: Version 11</p>\n<p>Disk space: 500 MB</p>\n<p>Sound Card: DirectX compatible</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T06:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27dfb21ad065a55d8d6b476c1643ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kamaarts"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
