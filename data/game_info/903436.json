It can also be described like the\u00a0\"Unhudo\" (a feral humanoid with big claws), or even a spirit.<br/>The most popular description of TFOTW is that of a hairy, dark,\u00a0massive tree shaped creature. It's completely immune to damage and can only be \"annoyed\" by damaging this spot in it's belly. It howls with a thundering voice at night and appears to hate humans, since it's the only thing that makes it move and reveal itself.<br/>It's said that the easy way of identifying the monster, is by looking at the forest from afar, for it pretends to be the tallest tree in there.</p>\n<p>In the game I mix a bit of every concept and create this crazy ghostly tree monster. I hope it becomes more popular with time :)</p>\n\n<p>How to get the bad ending:</p>\n<p>Play the game normally, survive in the woods while gathering the hair strands of the creature and bringing them back to the old lady.</p>\n\n<p>How to get the good ending:</p>\n<p>Instead of gatherinf the hair, get all the hidden diary notes. Once you get 4 notes, go to the middle of the forest and the skeleton there will turn into the entrance to an undreground tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>- About Depression -</p>\n<p>It is the main aspect of the game, it's the main aspect of my life, as the author of the story and I just wanna beat it someday.<br/>The title is a nod to a better future, and I've decided not to name the characters to express the feeling of being no one.</p>\n<p>During the good ending, there's this process of going from the depths of the earth to the height of the tallest tree. There, our hero feels alive, even though it's through adrenaline. In that moment there's this anger towards his own condition\u00a0and that works like an electric shock to bring him back to life.</p>\n<p>If you experience any kind of emotional/mental problem, get professional help. There's no shame in it.\u00a0</p>If you join my Patreon, you can get this game and all future games for $1 per month!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T09:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/3903a22cad4ce2fd195c4f2be841c9df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adriano Silva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
