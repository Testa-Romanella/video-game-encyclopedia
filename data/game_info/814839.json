Lowered sails means your ship goes faster, but turns at a bigger radious.</p>\n<p>Shoot at enemy ships with the A and D keys.</p>\n<p>When a cannonball hits your ship, it creates holes on her hull. Fix the holes with holding the S key.</p>\n<p>When holes are left unfixed, water rushes into the ship. More holes mean water can get in faster. If the ship is full of water, it sinks. You can bucket out water by holding the W key.</p>\n<p>You can use your looking glass with Space.<br/></p>\n\n<p>When sunk, enemy ships drop treasure. Sail through the chests to plunder the gold.</p>\n<p>When your ship sinks, you lose all your gold on board. However, you can stash your gold at outposts by sailing through the dark blue parts of the sea.</p>\n<p>You can toggle the CRT effect with F1.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game Design, Programming, Additional Graphics by theLionCount (thelioncount.itch.io)</p>\n<p>PIPOYA Vehicle &amp; Ship Sprites by PIPOYA (pipoya.itch.io)</p>\n<p>RPG Beach Tileset by stealthix (stealthix.itch.io)</p>\n<p>Drunken Sailor (8 Bit Chiptune) by Raxlen Slice (youtube.com/c/RaxlenSlice)</p>\n<p>VCR OSD Mono by Riciery Leal (dafont.com/profile.php?user=777625)</p>\n<p>Windlass by Gabriela G\u00fcther (dafont.com/profile.php?user=742741)</p>\n<p>Retro SFXs by Andrea Baroni (andreabaroni.com)</p>\n<p>Game Design Consulting, Additional Writing by Krisztian Nagy (twitter.com/rozsd_s)</p>\n<p>Additional Graphics Work, Additional Testing by Omaano (instagram.com/omaano)</p>\n<p>Based on the game 'Sea of Thieves' by Rare, which I obviously don't own in any way</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:16:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17b/17bc1ac615d328254c91be90aff83f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["theLionCount"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
