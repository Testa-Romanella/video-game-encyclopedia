{"id": 624402, "slug": "training-leah", "name": "Training Leah", "name_original": "Training Leah", "description": "<p>After having defeated countless monsters and even some demons, you were gifted a hero&#39;s sword that came with a lot of prestige. Along with the prestige came a lot of expectations. Expectations that you want no part in, as you try to live a somewhat safer life without having to fight demons again. With rumors of monsters spawning in the south, you try to make your way north, when a woman named Leah approaches you and asks for your help in saving her village.<br />\nThe game features turn-based strategy combat. Though it is a SRPG, there is no cumbersome level grind or needless filler fights. This doesn&#39;t mean the battles are easy, however, as you&#39;ll need to carefully plan and strategize how best to utilize those under your command as well as uncontrollable NPCs and how they affect the battlefield.<br />\nAs the plot progresses, your relationship with Leah will also progress. In time, this will lead to romantic and even sexual situations. The game contains fully uncensored adult content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T13:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/69e/69e1fbfe9f3b0f52b9840dc46b37307c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noxurtica"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Noxurtica"], "esrb_rating": null}
