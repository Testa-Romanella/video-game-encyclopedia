Gears of War for many years has become the hallmark of the game console from Microsoft.

This is the first game of the series.</p>\n<p>The action takes place on the exoplanet Sera. On it, there is a stronghold of human civilization, which after a thousand-year conflict is on the verge of collapse. Underneath all the main human cities, dwells the Locust Horde - inhuman monsters the size of a truck.</p>\n<p>The player becomes a soldier Marcus Phoenix from the Coalition of Ordered Governments. The action begins 14 years after the first contact: the prison in which the Phoenix was kept attacked by The Horde.
