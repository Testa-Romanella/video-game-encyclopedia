Don't run out of time before you find the exit to continue to the next maze. You have to keep running to catch up with time, if time runs out then you have to repeat it. You can control the character's movement, walk, run, jump. There is a minimap that will make it easier for you to know your position. You can also view the full map to find the best way out. To play this game you have to use a PC.\u00a0</p><p>I made this game with my friends, Andi Ardiansyah as 3D Artist and Fajri Nurwahid as Game Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d4db4ad1120c52bb630f92f702862a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ahmad Shahal Mahfudz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
