This is based on my other game, Evolpedal, but differs in that this uses a humanoid model to animate and is 3D.</p>\n<p>The structure of the human cannot change\u00a0(yet!), so it must learn to walk by evolving its movement patterns. This includes timers on up to 100 movements for its head, spine, pelvis, thighs, calves, and feet. In addition to the timers, the direction, force, and even restrictions of individual joints can evolve. Over time, the lifeform will refine its movements to *hopefully* look more lifelike. However, its only objective is distance.</p>\n<p>Evolution is random and the amount of chance can be adjusted.\u00a0Different variations of the parent lifeform will be tried until one of them traverses farther. This is based on displacement, so they must get farther in any direction from their origin. This record is displayed in the top-left.\u00a0\u00a0If the mutated offspring doesn't do better than its parent, it's discarded. Then, another\u00a0mutation based off the parent is tried. Once an offspring beats the record of best displacement, it becomes the new parent and all future offspring are based off of it. This is, in a nutshell, how natural selection works in nature.</p>\n<p>But, what about non-human models? Well, I figured why not allow weird evolutions too? So there is a setting that can turn on non-human joint evolutions. This means the lifeform can evolve to have knees that bend backwards and a twisted up spine, and more horrific sights. This makes for interesting results! You'll soon see how a random evolution decides to move the human body when the limitations are next to none.</p>\n<p>The game comes with a variety of settings sliders. The user can play around with Node Control (how strong each part is), Mass Control (how heavy each part is), among plenty of other adjustments. The camera automatically follows your lifeform, though you can toggle that with C and fly around with the mouse and WASD.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind this is actively being worked on and will receive updates and bug fixes. Simulations, especially this kind, are extremely sensitive. After all, we took millions of years to evolve to our highly specialized and complex walking patterns. Also, this is\u00a0<em>not\u00a0</em>AI. This is decisionless evolution, meaning different movements are generated randomly. No AI is deciding on the next moves, so you should expect many rounds to pass before you get something \"cool.\" I have yet to evolve a perfect human walk with this, but it is\u00a0<em>theoretically</em> possible. It's all about finding the perfect settings adjustment to increase the\u00a0<em>chance\u00a0</em>of a better evolution.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the Minimum Head Height to force the lifeform to keep its head above an arbitrary point. If it doesn't, the round ends. However, if it\u00a0<em>did\u00a0</em>beat the record for displacement, it is not discarded. This way, falling over is not completely penalized, because every lifeform is going to eventually fall over. Over time, with this setting on, lifeforms will evolve to stay upright longer so that they can traverse farther to beat the displacement record.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, want to share a video or screenshot (press 9 to take one), or especially if you have found more optimal settings, please make a discussion post below.</p>\n\n<p>Check out my other games here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77dc2dbfa563660b4ecb161ba0d1f518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Evol Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
