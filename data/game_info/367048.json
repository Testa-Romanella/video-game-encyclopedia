Command your troops, show your martial ingenuity and complete all tasks.<br/><br/>In the 1970-80s, the world was divided into two camps. Ideological systems are at the peak of military, economic and geopolitical confrontation. The arms race is getting up to the highest boiling-point. The parties threaten each other in various ways - from deployment of ballistic missiles in the allied countries to strategic defense initiative in space. During this time difficult negotiations are underway to reduce all types of weapons. Let's simulate what could happen if the parties did not find a common language?<br/><br/>In our game, as alternative history we propose choosing a side in a hypothetical conflict between two competing blocs led by the USSR and the USA. <br/><br/>Actions deploy on the territory of divided Germany in the 1970s.<h3>PLACE OF ACTIONS: GERMANY 1970s</h3>Realize your military tactical conception on large maps of divided Germany of the 1970s, based on historical cartography. Competently use your tactical advantages of the position.<br/><h3>CO-OPERATION AND INTERACTION BETWEEN VARIOUS TYPES OF TROOPS</h3>In the battle do not forget about interaction between various types of troops: cover your ground troops with aviation, defend against air raids with air defense, scout enemy positions, strike enemy troops\u2019 gatherings by artillery and replenish ammunition in time.<br/><h3>HISTORICALLY ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT APPEARANCE</h3>More than 50 highly detailed 3D-models of military machinery and equipment have been transferred to your command.<br/><h3>ADVANCED DAMAGE MULTIFACTOR MODEL</h3>Our game has an advanced system of registration of equipment damage instead of a health-bar (life-bar). Panzer vehicle schemes correspond to real prototypes. Our algorithms take into account the thickness, type and inclination of the armoured sheets when calculating the damage. The damage mode calculation counts the nearness of the hit to the place of a crew, engine, ammunition and chassis. Class of ammunition, the firing distance and the angle of impact \u2013 all that counts in the model. Thanks to this, the planning of tactical maneuvers can destroy enemy superior in strength.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a1f143c331b59507d536b6e14bdf45e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Room 301"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Room 301"], "esrb_rating": null}
