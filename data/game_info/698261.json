As of now, there are only two mission types and only one planet, but more are in development. There is also no progression in the game yet--This will be one of the first things updated. New weapons/shields/etc will be added, as well as a marketplace to spend your credits and buy them at. Feedback and bug reports are incredibly appreciated.
