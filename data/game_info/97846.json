Kite's goal has always been to get the players adrenaline pumping, make them pucker up and finally deliver them into a zen garden of customization. Gameplay is classic twin-stick shmup, but each level has a different objective chain to complete and focuses on a specific mechanic or feature. After completion, players are ranked and features are unlocked based on their performance. Next, it's time to prepare for battle by customizing character load out - changing the items/abilities/weapons/companions and tweaking stats.</p>Alpha Build<p>Kite is moving into the final stages of Alpha and there is a build available for playtesting. The tutorial is a weak point and requires the player to tab through some dialogue while NPCs info dump all the mechanics at once. Currently all items/abilities are unlocked from the start, so beating levels and gaining EXP is the only progression. Gating the player experience and metering out mechanics is a design focus and will be a milestone for the Beta version. That being said, there are 7 levels for players to obtain an 'S' rank on. Survive turrest, droids, mines and grenades, save scientists, decrypt data and destroy infrastructure - the faster the better! </p><p>GL and thanks for checking out Kite!
