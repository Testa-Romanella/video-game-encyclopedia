Also known as Galaxy II <br/>*Screenshots show actual app in action and original artwork based on the original packaging. See how close to the real thing it is!<br/><br/>  Travel back to the 80's and this was THE video game to have in the home. It was one of the most advanced video games of the time with four sub games, coloured fluorescent display and a joystick only seen in the arcades. You could finally have your very own arcade machine in your home. These types of machines were made by companies such as Grandstand, Tomy, Entex, CGL, Tandy, Bandai and Epoch to name but a few.<br/>Also known as \"Galaxy II\" by Epoch<br/><br/>\u2022 Accurate simulation of the classic handheld /desktop machine <br/>\u2022 Full retro sounds <br/>\u2022 4  waves of attack<br/>\u2022 Simple and addictive <br/>\u2022 Totally nostalgic <br/><br/>Some reviews so far:<br/><br/>Great retro fun *****<br/>by romfordneil - Version 1.0 - Sep 7, 2013<br/><br/>Super gameplay just like the original machine for those of us of a certain age!<br/><br/>A blast from the past *****<br/>by Bagpuss1000 - Version 1.0 - Sep 3, 2013<br/><br/>A perfect emulation...... A must for retro fans.<br/><br/>Brilliant old skool action *****<br/>by psj3809 - Version 1.0 - Sep 2, 2013<br/><br/>I remember this from the early 80s. It was one if the best tabletop games out there This is a brilliant version for iOS and the memories come flooding back. Well worth picking up<br/><br/>  TO PLAY:<br/>Turn Power ON (menu will disappear and intro music will play).<br/>Select Level (Graphics will resemble difficulty level).<br/>Press Start (Gameplay will begin after intro music).<br/>Fire at all enemies while dodging enemy fire on all phases of attack.<br/>If you survive three attack waves,you get the chance for more points if you can dock your rocket-ship.<br/>Press fire, left and right for thrusts to land rocket ship.<br/>Game is complete when you reach 9999 points or you lose all your lives.<br/>To restart, turn off and on Power.<br/>If using with iCade or compatible controller, press the iCade button on top left and you can now use joystick and red fire(5) button. <br/>NOTE: pressing this without connection to a compatible Bluetooth controller will bring up the keyboard. If this happens just press the button again to turn it off.<br/><br/>  We have painstakingly analysed every detail of this game and we have managed to achieve 99% of the original. We had to modify the controls as it simply does not work as well on an iPhone or iPad so you now have extra large arrow keys but we have left the joystick in for the purists out there (which you can try to use but we recommend the larger arrow keys). All the sound effects are here. All four phases including the docking sequence. We compared this to two real machines as these also vary with slight details and we are very pleased with the results. We hope you will be too. If you find anything that does not feel quite right let us know from the app. Enjoy this blast from the past and if you like this why not look at our others.<br/><br/> More information about this classic game on Wikipedia:<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Wars", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85acee9b1144041b67db6e4c6872b590_gwdzkbA.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rob Wilmot"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Rob Wilmot"], "esrb_rating": null}
