A\u00a0 diminutive 256x150 resolution, meant to evoke the EGA graphics standard,  is scaled up to be easily played on any modern high-resolution display.<br/></p>\n<p>You can split any pair, twice. You can double down on any hand or split. The house always hits to 17. There are six decks in play, and the house shuffles when less than 60 cards are left in the shoe.</p>\n<p>Statistics are tracked persistently, so you can see how you're playing over time across all of your sessions. You may also reset the stats at any time.<br/></p>\n<p>Warning: The entire screen flashes when you hit blackjack.<br/></p>\n<p>Supports mouse and touch screen play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890add2364f0f1e19924e43a25664e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["krak"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
