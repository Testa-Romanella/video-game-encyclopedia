He is obsessed, and no one else can have you.<br/><br/>Only through the help of hidden notes left by the previous victim, do you learn this isn't the first time this psycho has done this. He's clearly had practice keeping victims locked away. <br/><br/>Explore your cell and find a way out into the rest of the basement. Examine the belongings of your captor and learn clues that will help solve puzzles and bring you closer to freedom and the truth behind your captivity before time runs out.<br/><br/><strong>Our Secret Below</strong> is a story-focused escape room with tactile puzzle-solving game play.
