Created early 2018.</p>\n<p>This game sparked my passion, wanting me to create more!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Learnt a lot about my limits when starting this project but was still the most fun!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0I created all the models myself using Maya. I had 5-6 weeks to complete this game. Our brief was we were to create a puzzle game individually.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay (Spoilers)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this game your goal is to rescue the princess, trapped in a cage onto of the giant bed.\r\n  </p>\n<p>To get to the princess you\u00a0must complete a maze. This maze is mostly vertical, and you can only open the end door when the maze is\u00a0invisible. You can practice and take notes when the maze is visible to give yourself a chance.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When completing the maze, the princess asks you to search the map for all the key fragments to set her free.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Once finding all the keys and returning to the princess you find out that the cage can never be empty and the princess then locks you in the cage, that is the end of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea is every person that plays the game ends up trapped and then pretends they need to be rescued to fool the next player into taking their place.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I had fun creating this game and learning all the differently functionalities that Unity has. My favorite part was writing the C# code and watching my game grow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creator \u2013 Ebeney Russell</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://ebeneyrussell.wixsite.com/website\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63ce4653306dca7256e0f02276752c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miss Ebs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
