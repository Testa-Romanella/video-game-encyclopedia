Wishlist this game on Steam.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Getting stuck? Try reading the manual!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is centered around the concept of crafting spells by stacking different pages of a spellbook.</p>\n<p>You're outfitted with a few basic pages, but you get access to more as you fight enemies and sail the sea! There are a bunch of different spells that are the result of many types of combination, so experiment away to see if you can get more power of more utility out of every little spell.</p>\n<p>Every island there is adventure waiting! Will you get a new spellbook page? Craft a new combination of scrolls? Solve a magic puzzle? Perhaps a talk with a stranger? Who knows!</p>\n<p><strong>Her story</strong></p>\n<p>The game takes place through the character of Clarice Clairvoyage, a young mage in training who is the only one left after a small crisis hits her home island and all of her friends and family are abducted, never to be seen again. In her bravery, Clarice collects what's left of her home and chargers with a ship she found across the seas where she might find her family and friends again!</p>\n<p><strong>The tech</strong></p>\n<p>All of the pixel and music assets are self-made, so is the code. All of the code is written in PICO8 itself and all of the PICO8'ing is done on a Raspberry Pi 400! I wanted this project to feel like a kid exploring a C64 or getting one of those BBC computers for Christmas. I was born in 1998, so I missed out on those things :)</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think, I'd love to hear your feedback &amp; thoughts!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T10:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/1469cd3c12c01bf5d10037f5aa06db1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bram Dingelstad"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
