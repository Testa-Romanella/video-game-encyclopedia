If you fail in one run, you must restart. <br/><br/>Have fun, and happy holidays. <br/><br/>This game is dedicated a friend of mine who was taken too soon. I think about him and his family sometimes during the holidays and in the Secret Santa note I was given, they told me they liked golf. So did he. He would have loved this game, so I dedicated it to him.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a99c957c3f1b1bfb7e501852e7f847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
