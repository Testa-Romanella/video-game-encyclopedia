Meet Mr Hugh Mann. Hugh loves humans, and he wants to be just like them!

Just don't be too suspicious along the way! You might be surprised at how forgiving people can be, but make sure not to push your luck too far or you could end up in hot water. And who knows? Hugh might just save the world...<br/><br/>Human Simulator offers a host of funny and interesting jobs for Hugh to attend, with each level becoming more complex and difficult along the way. By physically rotating Hugh's head, as well as pushing and pulling his hands, and manually operating his legs, you might end up realising how much we take for granted in just being our normal human selves. After all, being human is surprisingly tough! How tough, you ask?
