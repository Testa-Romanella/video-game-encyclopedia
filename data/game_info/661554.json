Please report how it runs on older machines though :)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Source code</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I put around a years work into it on and off\u00a0during the evenings (which is both hard but fun), so please consider giving\u00a0a tiny donation or buying the source code. It would really\u00a0motivate me to do more stuff like this!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>FREE! &lt;3\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The game is of course still free, and i hope it triggers just a fraction of your good old memories of EGA games, just the way it did for me while i developed it.</p>\n<p><strong>Want to make games together?</strong></p>\n<p>I am always working on new game projects for old machines, but would love to do them with a talented pixel artist and/or game designer. So feel free to get in touch!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:39:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c4aeb8fdb59aa70a90ec3c4db95230.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["megakode"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
