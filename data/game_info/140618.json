But how exactly are they connected? Explore the house and find notes in order to figure it out, but there's ghosts!</p>\n<p>''Gathering on Halloween Night to Summon'' is a short (5-10 minute long) adventure game made in like 3 or 4 hours. It is meant to be a horror game parody, and hence is not particulary scary. Do watch out, however, as a few sudden scares do occur.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0a/a0a714020e061a30318af71347a68836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frogge"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
