They want to know if your species is intelligent, so they have dropped you into a little human hamster cage and given you the maintenance manual.\u00a0Bad news: it's in THEIR language. Good news: if you have the equivalent intelligence of a larva, you should be able to translate the manual and keep yourself alive!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Two things are needed to play this game: the on-screen executable AND the instruction manual pdf. </strong>We highly recommend printing the manual out and writing all over it.</p>\n<p>More optional downloads include a blank lexicon, for you to keep track of words you think you've translated, and more information about the sounds of the language, if you just happen to be a language nerd and wanna nerd out (might be kinda spoilery, so don't read this until you've played a bit).\u00a0<br/><br/>~Credits~<br/></p>\n<p>Pat Farnach - 3D art<br/>Casey Frantum - audio<br/>Yori Kvitchko - programming<br/>Qristy Overton - language construction<br/>Alex Privee - design<br/>Andrew Yolland - font creation, manual production<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d27f2fb850af3afceb6e67c82b4a5ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ayolland", "Pat", "nextlevelbanana", "YoriKv"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
