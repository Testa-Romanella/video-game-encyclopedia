Cubidoo loves eating food, but if she eats too much, her body transforms into a cube and moves very slowly, and if she stays fit, her body transforms into a tiny furball and moves faster! One day, Cubidoo heard that The Eight Holy Pizzas will fall from the sky, and so she sets her feet on an epic journey to find them all...</p>\r\n\u00a0 Instruction\r\n<p>Raid every slice of\u00a0holy pizza goodness from the hands of Evil Grampas and Grammas!\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the same time, don't starve yourself or you will lose determination and give up this epic journey.</p>\n<p>And try not to produce bugs! We went a bit too optimistic about the complexity of this game so.... there are LOTS.. LOOOOTS of bugs. We will keep updating the the game to SATISFY YOUR NEEDS.
