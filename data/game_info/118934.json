Developed by one man-child, Jake Benbow, in the space of three weeks, it's a short, sweet and simple game, but I like to think it's pretty fun. As it stands, the game is complete, however if people seem to enjoy it then I could always revisit it.</p><p> I hope you enjoy playing, please let me know what you think on Twitter (@jakebenbow) and also if you have time to complete a quick feedback form, that'd be awesome! The game is free, but if you really really like the game, then if you could give me a small tip or donation then that'd be greatly appreciated,</p><p>Happy bombing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c4e5fa195cfef0009e7ce03cc297d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jakebenbow"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
