Each level will contain a set number of enemies. The amount of bullets the player has is strictly related to how many enemies there are in the level. For example, if there are 3 enemies in one level, then the player will only have 3 bullets to eliminate all of the following enemies. The levels will get increasingly harder and with the introduction of new mechanics, the player's knowledge and skills of these mechanics will be tested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef74e5ea2b248ab75802e1549b31114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["topbaca"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
