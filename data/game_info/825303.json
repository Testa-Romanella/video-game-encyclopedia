At the beginning of a round, each player draws seven dice.\u00a0</p><p>Players take alternating turns. On your turn you can perform one of the following actions: <em>Load, Seek, Strike,</em> or <em>Surface.</em> </p>\n<p>You win the round with a successful <em>Strike.</em> <br/></p>\n<em>Load</em>\n<p>To <em>Load</em>, draw a die.  \r\n    </p>\n<em>Seek</em>\n<p>To <em>Seek</em>, discard a die. Your opponent must either <em>a)</em> discard a die of the same number from their hand; or <em>b)</em> discard two dice.      </p>\n<em>Strike</em>\n<p>To <em>Strike</em>, play any two dice from your hand. Your opponent must dodge your <em>Strike</em> by playing a die from their hand of the same number as one of the dice you played for your <em>Strike.</em> </p>\n<p>If your <em>Strike</em> is successful, <strong>you win the round</strong>. Otherwise, the dice you and your opponent played are discarded.      </p>\n<em>Surface</em>\n<p>If there are no dice left in your draw pile, you are <em>Suffocating</em> and you ignore any effect that would cause you to draw dice. You must <em>Surface</em> to refresh your draw pile.      </p>\n<p>To <em>Surface</em>, shuffle your discard pile into your draw pile. <br/></p>\n<strong>== BASIC STRATEGY ==</strong>\n<p>- Use Seeks to whittle down your opponent, then Strike to finish the job once you have them cornered.<br/>- When your opponent has no/few dice in hand, it's a great time to strike.<br/>-\u00a0Striking with two of the same die (e.g. \u2685\u2685) is much better than striking with two different dice<br/>- Look at your opponent's discard pile to determine the best dice to strike with.<br/></p>\n<strong>== CREDITS ==</strong>\n<p>- The original version of the game rules was designed by Chin Kee Yong and licensed under a Creative Commons 4.0 International license.\r\n    <br/>- Thanks to Zhong Yang for visual design, brainstorming, and playtesting.\r\n    <br/>- Thanks to Julius and Donald for joining me today .
