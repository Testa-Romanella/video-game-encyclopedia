A fierce demon, ruler over\u00a0Ja`han that came through the portal, takes the sorcerer`s body and starts a quest to conquer the humans` souls. A young sorcerer is sent to retrieve\u00a0some magical tablets that can block the portal.</p><p><em>This is the demo/free version of Pagan Hope</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a80326464a78ad4a02ae4c5706ddf68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vmtbits"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
