Block them off to get past them.  You may have to switch lenses to find extra blocks, or reuse ones you've found before.</p><p>Take your time and look around with the different lenses.  Try to anticipate what's coming up, especially around beasts.  Be careful though as you're not likely to survive after enraging a beast by using a lens near it.</p><p>If you're having trouble with a beast, keep your lenses off and stick to the shadows. \u00a0Usually, making a break for it is not a good option. \u00a0Listen for the lower growl when he returns to his home spot and wait a few seconds for him to get there before moving to the next shadow.</p><p>The last beast is really too hard at this point, but it <em>is possible</em> to get past him. \u00a0Use the nearest shadows you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a405b143c0c81f5795e1f7f0e9e43ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MyFarms Game Jam II"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
