First they both have to go shopping and fill their cart with all the ingredients they need. Then they will cut vegetables and do a salad using lettuce, tomatoes, carrots and salt. Then they will heat some oil and cook some eggs in it, doing sunny sides up. Finally they will create a burger stacking buns, lettuce, cheese, onions, meat and ketchup. This is a very healthy and nutritious breakfast and Baby Lulu will surely learn a lot for when she grows up. Of course, she will not use the knife and fire herself, she will just hand the items to her mother, assisting her and watching carefully.
