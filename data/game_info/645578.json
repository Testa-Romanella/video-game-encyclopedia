Avoid their bullets, as well as cover fire from their turrets, as you weave your way around three different biomes, all with different obstacles and layouts. Oh, and in case you didn\u2019t realize: yup, there are a lot of tanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD or Arrow Keys </strong>- Move</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Shoot</li></ul>\n<p>Eliminate all enemy tanks while avoiding getting shot yourself</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> :</p>\n<p><strong>Zachary Norton</strong>: Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan Whiton</strong>:\u00a0 Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Jesse Thomsen</strong>:\u00a0 Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Brooke Holmes</strong>:\u00a0 Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:28:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/643713ae597775238a7e38b0a4a8195e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Champlain Game Academy 2021"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
