Pretty simple, I'd say. Ideally this game would be a browser game, however\u00a0 I failed to get that working, as I'm pretty inexperienced in that arena. I hope you understand and enjoy! This game is in Alpha version currently and will have updates every so often. If any bugs or balancing issues\u00a0are found, feel free to comment or lemme know in the discord server.
