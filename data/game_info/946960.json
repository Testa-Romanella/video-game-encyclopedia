And of course\u00a0<strong>managing</strong>\u00a0your various stats within the game too...<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 If YOU believe you can do all of that at the same time without it being <strong>TOO MUCH</strong> for you, well give this game a try. Here you will be attempting to hire workers, fire at enemies, and trying to get the perfect balance between upgrading your stats and your income. Can you hold the enemies long enough til' you have enough money to buy the\u00a0<strong>Lost Soul</strong> and give permanent\u00a0salvation to your Civilization?<br/><em>(<strong>PS:</strong> a more in-depth guide can be found inside the game, on the main menu!)</em></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>to move<br/>-\u00a0<strong>LMB\u00a0 </strong>or <strong>RMB</strong>\u00a0to\u00a0shoot</p>\r\nMore Information\r\n<p>- This game was originally planned to be made for TriJam #212 (with the theme \"Too Much\" and a\u00a0 3h time limit), but I ended up overscoping my game WAY too much. That's why I decided to ditch the competition and instead try to finish &amp; polish the game to be as good as possible. The game itself was developed spanning 3 days, and with a total time of around 15 hours (including making the sprites and art for the game, but NOT including the music as I had already made some before starting the development).</p>\r\nAssets Used\r\n<p>- <strong>Music:</strong> Made by me (it's goofy I know\u00a0lol)<br/>-<strong>\u00a0Playlist that's within the settings: </strong>Re-used from a project I'm currently\u00a0working on (Iron Infantry)\r\n<br/>- <strong>DOTween:</strong> On the Unity asset store</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> Good luck! (also please comment down below if you feel that the difficulty of the game is all over the place, thanks!)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:07:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/494c1d5b596af46cffa3a57da15c7f26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Use3rnamed"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
