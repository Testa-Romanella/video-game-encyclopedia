I say developer because in Japan there's a lot of games that are developed by developers and then the fans are critical of them, but I usually do the\n\ndeveloping.\n\nWhat does this platform have to do with this?\n\nWell, the Xtreme 3 prototype is currently being developed by a team that's called Outhouse Media.\n\nWe wanted to provide a new experience to the fans and that's what we did.\n\nSource: WikiMedia Commons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:48:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7ca6d5c3c4db3ef6f28ce7ef7c1acee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
