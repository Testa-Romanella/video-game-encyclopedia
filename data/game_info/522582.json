It's filled with inside jokes, a really silly sense of plot, the mechanics are both unique and flawed and I love it. The game is sadly unfinished and will likely stay that way however this game is still worth your time at about 2 or so hours of play time. Give it a try and have fun with my silly sound effects, the only thing that will likely stay consistent throughout all of my games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b25618265d69d68bed6c6428350fe2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProfessorHerb"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
