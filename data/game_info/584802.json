To fend of any tumbleweed you can shoot it with your trusty ol' revolver, but watch out not to launch yourself into cacti!</p>\n<p>Side note: There is a bug where the ammo UI is just a black square when the game is played in the browser for some reason, so until I fix it just pretend you can see it :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T05:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b37/b372f3dfc876fb9ef95bef6ad9ef9c45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stevemcwin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
