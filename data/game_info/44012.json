Dracula's books need to be safe for a long period of time. Many of the ancient texts cannot be touched by mortal hands or they will be damaged beyond repair. You must use your wand of lightning to invoke numerous spells to organize and seal the ancient tombs. Invisibility will then be cast at the end to protect them from thieves. You have only nine counter spells that will fix running out of time for the spells but can earn more through progress.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n54 increasingly difficult levels.<br/>\r\nSix symbol types that must be cast to properly seal the tomes.<br/>\r\nSome variations of symbols can be figured out to shorten cast/draw times.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T10:35:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd384e1238e20056850666af70a9408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 93, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5000, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G.
