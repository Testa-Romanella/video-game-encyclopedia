One has developed the ability to mutate humans to have superhuman abilities, and the other has developed impressively advanced machinery. Everyone in both nations knows about a mythical wishing well, which is said to grant one person one wish every five hundred years. Rulers, rebels, and refugees from both cities are scrambling to find the wishing well and to achieve their innermost desires.</p>\n<p>You play as a hero who has been trusted to find the wishing well, preventing someone truly evil and destructive from making the wish instead. If you are able to defeat powerful enemies from both the Mutant nation and the Machinery nation, you will have the chance to have your greatest desire realized.</p>\n<p>Mutants and Machinery is a Roguelike with randomly generated worlds. Explore different biomes across the world full of dangerous mutants and robots, and craft strong items to ensure victory against threatening bosses. You only have a limited amount of time to prepare for each boss, so good preparation is key.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game is in the early prototype stage, with only one level, one character, and one boss. It also has the lack of polish that the final version will have. If you see any bugs, tips, or anything in general, leave a comment so I can make this game the best that it can be!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/0087cc6c155186bd702ee1f59e1904be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheOneAndOnlyNate2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
