Each of them behaves in their own unique way, from being in the room you were in last, to waiting for you to open doors to ambush you, and more. You must learn from your experience to evade them long enough to survive until 7 AM to win. It's all about learning, strategy, and execution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can run into the dark vents, hide in the empty cabinets, duck behind furniture and more to survive. However, there are many mistakes you can make as well. You must learn them and learn FROM them in order to win. Anything you do can get you killed, especially hesitation.
