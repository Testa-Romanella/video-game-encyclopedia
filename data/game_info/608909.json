{"id": 608909, "slug": "prehistoric-grapple-early-demo", "name": "Prehistoric Grapple - Early Demo", "name_original": "Prehistoric Grapple - Early Demo", "description": "<p>Prehistoric Grapple is a 2D Adventure Platformer where you explore a prehistoric island with a grappling hook. You play as Rex, a Dinosaur who was frozen in a block of ice and was reanimated by lightning during a storm. Rex awakens on a\u00a0 unfamiliar prehistoric island\u00a0\u00a0and soon discovers a grappling hook which he can use to explore the island and fight monsters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On your journey to explore the island, you'll encounter a wide variety of obstacles such as lava, monsters to fight, ponds, of water to swim through,\u00a0\u00a0and much more. You'll also meet the strange inhabitants of the island who always seem to have a lot to say such as the self aware talking signposts who scatter the beach. Talking to these characters can give you valuable information on the island or just some funny dialogue.</p>\n<p>Use the A and D keys or the left and right arrow keys to move Rex left and right. You can use the space bar to jump and you can click on a point on the screen to grapple to it. Pressing W or the up arrow key will allow you to engage in dialogue with characters while pressing the S or down arrow key will allow you to restore one point of health in exchange for 5 fruits.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is an early version of the game that has only been worked on for a few weeks. Only the beach and coastline sections of the island are available and much more will be added in the full version, along with many bug fixes and improvements to the gameplay. More demos may be released before the full release of the game although there is no current timetable for when the next demo or full game will be released.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The project may be complete by the end of the year but it is my first full game release and I am currently developing it alone so it may take longer. I plan on releasing the game on itch.io and possibly steam, but I haven't decided on a price or if there will even be one. If there is a price, it will be minimal and it may only apply to the steam release, but again, I don't know yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan on making the game as easy to access as\u00a0 possible because as a brand new developer, I think it is more important that people play my game than it is for me to make money off of it. While I would like to make money off of my games at some point in the future, I am currently developing games with the hope of getting better at it and making fun experiences to share with others.<br/></p>\n<p>As this game is still in early development, any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I hope you have fun with the early demo of Prehistoric Grapple and will be looking forward to the full release in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86f71175e0ef2b16482d44411b2011d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["benhen_26"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
