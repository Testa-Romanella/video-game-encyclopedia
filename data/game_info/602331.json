Through a physical exploration of the sea\u2019s forbidden, moonlike landscapes, to intimate encounters with local characters, the user gets a rare glimpse into one of the world\u2019s most dangerous, soon to be extinct, wonders. Centuries of human intervention and political neglect have turned the Dead Sea into a precarious place. Its water levels have dropped dramatically, leaving behind sinkholes and collapsing beaches. The experience offers a deep insight into the complexity and very human impact of this ecological and geopolitical crisis. Once Upon a Sea is our call to action.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T03:26:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e7baf1d1a654c9307e2d8e47fd291ee.jpg", "website": "http://deadseavr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blimey"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Blimey"], "esrb_rating": null}
