You are a Blue sphere lost in world with no explanations and you try to find the seven spheres that connect and follow you, explore the environment with WASD or directional keys(ESC for menu). There is no sound in the game, I was planning to add but I was afraid of infringing copyrights.\u00a0 Enjoy!
