{"id": 752966, "slug": "lion-messenger", "name": "Lion Messenger", "name_original": "Lion Messenger", "description": "<p><em>Lion Messenger</em>\u00a0is an interactive chat log following my own conversations with God throughout the Christian season of Lent. Conversations are added regularly. Each entry's content is unplanned: I have no idea what each day will bring nor how the conversation will unfold.</p>\n<p>Lent has always been an important spiritual season in my life. In following Catholic tradition, simply giving up things for Lent was never particularly helpful for me. Instead, I found choosing to start something new was far more healing. This project was initially born from that - I wanted to be more intentional with Jesus.</p>\n<p><em>Lion Messenger</em>\u00a0is now my second piece referencing my spiritual life, but it's my first directly addressing it. My relationship with Jesus is unconventional by all means. It feels only natural that I process this significant aspect of my life through my art practice. I invite the viewer to read and experience a slice of my personal chat history as I continue to seek some higher truth.</p>\n<p><em>Lion Messenger</em>, HTML5 Game built with Twine, 2022</p>\n\n<p>Controls: This piece is designed to\u00a0be played on a computer.
