I made this game in return. It's quite difficult, so good luck. (There's also an extremely game breaking bug, so sorry about that, this game was made in an hour ^^; )</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You are a penguin who is very hungry, and so you must eat the pancakes that are falling out of the sky. The gameplay is simple - consume as many pancakes as you can without them either touching the floor or you falling into the gap in the level, otherwise it's game over. Eating a pancake will increase your score.</p>\n<p>For some reason you can keep on playing the game even when you get a game over. Just press \"R\" if you fail if you want to keep things fair, otherwise you can continue playing (it's your decision, after all).</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrow keys - move left and right</p>\n<p>Up arrow key - jump</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Made with Godot 3.2.3</p>\n<p>Art created by Grafxkid</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef013e36046936ff8286098205233d9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kwago Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
