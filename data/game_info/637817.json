We were unable to complete it, but we have enough for this pre-alpha demo that you can try. It is not a complete experience, is not polished, and is very short, but we hope you enjoy it anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were many features we wanted to add, and we wished we could have a more complete game experience, but unfortunately we ran out of time. It was a good experience however, and is our first independent game development project for both of us! We are happy with what we accomplished and we hope you enjoy what we have created.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your motivation and support during this project.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The MacOS and Linux exports were not tested, and the HTML5 version may have bugs (especially with saving/loading, which isn't essential anyways). <br/></p>\n<p>Also, there is a bug allowing you to attain the GFM before you unlock it (use the scroll wheel). I forgot to remove it and I am too lazy to re-upload it. Since this is a demo it doesn't matter too much, but you can ignore that cheat if you like.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d8c8814b77ed5e71bcd1554c8fb1002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Conscience"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
