Compete on some of the most challenging and exhilarating drift stunt courses that will test even the best of drivers and push them to their limit! <br/><br/><strong>GAME FEATURES</strong><br/><br/>Career Mode<br/><br/>Career Mode is all about competing in a simulated drift stunt racing championship. You will have the opportunity to travel to several challenging stunt courses and compete against the very best drivers to try and rack up the most points for each event. After the regular season ends, eligible drivers will have the opportunity to compete for the Drift Stunt Racing Championship at the Championship Stunt Racing Course. <br/><br/>Stunt Courses<br/><br/>There are several different stunt courses that offer different layouts and different points opportunities. Each event starts with three minutes on the clock. Once the countdown clock reaches zero, the driver will be released from the starting area and have the opportunity to score as many points as possible. Once the three minutes has expired, each driver's final score will count towards the final standings for the event. The driver with the highest score wins the event and qualifies for a berth in the Drift Stunt Racing Championship at the Championship Stunt Racing Course.  <br/><br/>Event Scoring<br/><br/>There are several different ways to earn points at a Drift Stunt Racing event. The most common way to earn points is through a feature known as the 'Drift Chain'. This feature will calculate the length of a drift dynamically and add points to the driver score as the drift is taking place. Once the tires stop sliding and the drift comes to an end, the score will officially be added and the process starts all over again. Aside from the drift chain, there are also various stunts that can be completed on each stunt course in order to accumulate points. For example, some courses have a spinning hay pylon that can score points for drivers who successfully complete a full drift around the pylon. Drivers can also drive through checkpoints, tires, and crash crates to accumulate stunt points.<br/><br/>500 POINTS - STUNT COMPLETED<br/>300 POINTS - CRASH CRATE DESTROYED<br/>250 POINTS - FAST DRIVING SPEED<br/>DRIFT CHAIN (DYNAMIC POINTS) - DRIFTING<br/><br/><strong>STEAM FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Steam Achievements<br/></li><li> Controller Support (Driving)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250afed34ef42397c5e1d60c157c38a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDRumble"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JDRumble"], "esrb_rating": null}
