Inspired by nostalgia, the use of early web 2.0 and 90s aesthetics acts as a juxtaposition to our relationship with predictive algorithmic, content-driven information that continuously saturates our lives. Through the different artifacts, we follow a teenage character and her interactions with different worlds; the physical world (her bedroom), the digital world (screens), and her internal world, in the form of a visualized internet \"rabbit hole\". The final piece intends to convey a slice of her life that reflects a blurring of digital and physical realities. This project was created using a combination of Unity 3D, computer graphic art, and AI generated imagery using prompt engineering.</p>\n<p><strong>CAM Collective</strong> is made up of three multidisciplinary artists, Carisa Putri Antariksa, Amreen Ashraf and Maria Denise Yala. Their work focuses on worldbuilding, speculative storytelling and researching the various ways in which life and digital technologies are entwined. CAM\u2019s works primarily use new media technologies and digital materials to construct immersive storytelling experiences. They have participated in the following exhibitions and residencies: Coding Resistance fellowship with FUTURESS (2022), ADA-DADA Residency, South Asian Visual Arts Centre, Toronto (2021), UKAI Migration, Toronto (2020) and cyberhaze, OCAD University, Toronto (2020).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T06:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/6243579168dd6dad6950e34b0ca0485a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CAM Collective"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
