It is their mating season and you are needed to help them get busy. Help them finding mates by using the left and right arrow and meet another shapely with the either the same color or the same shape, but not both. Also be aware of brickeys they don't like shapelies.</p>\n<p>This is for the Untitled Game Jam 2020. The theme was 2. There theme is about mating(involving 2) and matching games(where you need to find a pair).\u00a0 There are different factors you can determine an object is a suitable match. They are color and shape. The scoring is in factors of 2. The each measure of the music\u00a0features two notes.\u00a0 You can have at most 2 lives only.</p>\n<p>This is my second game to be published. It is in the similar vein as my first game, but a little different aspect. If I did any expansion on it, I would update the sprites to have random faces. I would update the music to be better. Add more sound tweaks. Draw a good scrolling background.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Made using Unity, Aseprite, Bosca Ceoil, and Bfxr. All assets, code, music, design were created by me.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f0f89461802b98b5ddce43a06ea4a82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trainarmadillo88"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
