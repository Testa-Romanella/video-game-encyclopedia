In Wildlife Park you must build an animal park from scratch, managing it so your visitors will spend their money. You begin with just the park area, a ticket booth, and some money. From there you can buy animals, build the zoo, hire employees, and then open the gates and let the visitors come.</p>\n<p>Features: <br/>\u2022 45 detailed animated and simulated species ranging from mammals and reptiles to birds and marine animals <br/>\u2022 Fascinating, challenging, and realistic animal behavior in areas such as reproduction, socialization, aging, birth, aggression, and \"trainability\" <br/>\u2022 Animals can be trained with a huge variety of interaction devices such as trampolines, ropes, slides, trees, and video screens <br/>\u2022 Aside from the 20 missions there are (potential) zoo locations around the world awaiting the player to master zoo management under these different preconditions.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Choose a variety of terrains with different climates, environmental sounds, and music themes to start your park in. But be careful in your choices in climates and animals, as keeping a polar bear happy in the Sahara is an incredible challenge! <br/>\u2022 No single goal to reach the finish of the game. The park has to be managed well to gain access to new areas, attractions, and more importantly, exotic animals <br/>\u2022 No-limits landscaping at various heights, many plants, bridge constructions, ponds, rivers and waterfalls, and buildings <br/>\u2022 10 professions for your personnel to care for the animals and park: Feeder, Garbage, Zookeeper, Animal Catcher, Gardener,\u00a0 Vet, Worker, Animal Trainer, First-Aid <br/>\u2022 Great athmosphere with realistic sounds and corresponding music themes.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Building architecture style differs by climate <br/>\u2022 Transparent walls give visitors a better view of marine animals, allowing you to build underwater observation rooms\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf93890f2b471863dfbbcae24f0eae4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["b-Alive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
