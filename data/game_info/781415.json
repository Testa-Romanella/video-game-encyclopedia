And I wanted to learn more about non-nav mesh-based ai. And Physics-based movement/animations.</p>\n<p>The UI for the game was a bit rushed so it could have been much better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls can be found in the escape menu on the left side.\u00a0</p>\n\n<strong>How to play with twitch:</strong>\n<p>First, you need\u00a0to connect your stream when you're live on twitch. That can be done\u00a0by pressing the purple button, in the top right of the main menu page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On that page, you need to fill in your\u00a0channel name -  username - and oath password which you get by pressing the \"get your Oath link\" button.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Viewers can then join with the command: !join\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Currently, a maximum of\u00a050 viewers can be in the match. When an AI dies a new one can join in again. But this can be disabled by pressing the return/enter button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If a viewer joins in multiple times the ai from them won't attack each other.
