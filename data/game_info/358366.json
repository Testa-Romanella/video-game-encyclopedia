The player must use their character to manually manipulate the game's main cameras. Because of this, it is easy to lose your character. Press 1 to recenter the main camera on your character, or press ESCAPE and press RESTART to restart the level.<br/>There is no natural conclusion to the game. You must manually quit using the pause menu, even if all colors are collected.<br/><br/><strong>To Start</strong><br/>At the start of the game, <strong>hold W to walk forward until you see your character.</strong> This is for dramatic effect, however controls are not restricted, so it's easy to get lost at this point.<br/>Once your character is sufficiently close to your camera, press SPACE to pick your camera up and carry it around.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong><br/>The goal of the game is to collect every source of light in the world. There are 7 of them, one for each color of the rainbow.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>W - Move character forward.<br/>A - Turn character left.<br/>S - Move character backward.<br/>D - Move character right.<br/><br/>SPACE - Pick up or drop lights.<br/>E - Hold to project previously collected light forward. Release to stop movement.<br/>ESCAPE - Pause game.<br/><br/>LEFT CLICK - Used to drag camera windows around the screen. <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Can also be used to move the main camera by holding and moving the<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 mouse.<br/>RIGHT CLICK - Used to delete camera windows and reabsorb light cameras.<br/><br/>1-7 - Used to toggle character tracking on and off.
