Anything we had lying around was enough to build something that would allow us to play with friends.<br/><br/>With an old wooden board, several nails and some sticks, we could create a \"Preguinho\" field. Add to that a coin and we had a soccer game to play with friends. Then it was a matter of setting up a championship table and inviting the neighborhood to play in the contest. It was a fun time, even before video games.<br/><br/>Nail that Coin aims to bring back that joy, it simulates that iconic game from the past and will grant hours of fun to the entire family and friends, in a very competitive game. It shows the young what we did back then to have fun!<br/><br/>There's no age limit in this nostalgic game, it's all about physics and ability.<br/><br/>Nail that Coin includes:<br/>- Single player mode: play against an artificial intelligence with 5 different difficulty levels to choose<br/>- Two player mode: allows two players to compete against each other in the same device<br/>- Training mode: allows unlimited moves for a single player on the board<br/>- Shootout mode: never end up in a draw again, if you enable Shootout, upon a draw Nail that Coin starts Shootout mode placing the coin in increasingly difficult positions for free shots<br/>- Head to Head: the camera is automatically positioned for the player in front when it's his turn<br/>- Board style: old wood<br/>- 80's coin texture (Brazilian, Australian, American, German, English and French)<br/><br/>** No network multiplayer support yet.<br/><br/>Like our page on Facebook and check out the latest news on Nail that Coin (Preguinho):<br/>https://www.facebook.com/PreguinhoTheVideoGame.<br/><br/>It Nail that Coin (Preguinho)'s page you can message us with questions, comments or suggestions, we'll answer as soon as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T03:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e3c7e359cb0598f0322e062f585067_saY4BIa.jpg", "website": "http://www.preguinho.com.br", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Joao Carrion"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Joao Carrion"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
