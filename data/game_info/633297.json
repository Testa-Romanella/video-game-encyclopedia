[WARNING: Flashing lights can be intense in some situations.]</p>\n<p>This is a simple 3 stage game where you interact with the little vinyl players to progress through all 3 stages. You must avoid catching the \"eye\" of the reel to reel projectors, which float around the map going from TV to TV to watch their favorite shows. If you get close enough, you can even hear what they are watching...</p>\n<p>Nothing much else to this one. Enjoy!</p><p>P.S. I know there are performance issues. UE5 is a resource hog right now. A GTX1060 is most likely the minimum right now. Also, the game is hard. The projector ghosts are quite fast and can detect you very easily. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T08:45:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d7e416ab52084e73dcb3480f15bff16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skareeg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
