If two mirrors have markers,\u00a0you can walk from one to another. This only works on some mirrors. Right-click\u00a0to change the mirror type (the red mirror clones the last mirror and lets you walk out of it while the blue mirror lets you walk from one mirror to another). If you can't go from one mirror to another, press Space. This game is very buggy and far from finished, but I figured that I'd submit it anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e422074607b5173d7045156226b933e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Playoceratops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
