Elven Talk is a fun app for all ages that takes text written in the modern tongue and rewrites the text with an Elven flair.  Using copy and paste, this text can be transported to other apps (such as Mail) to send messages in Elven.  Text received in Elven (e.g. through the Mail app) can be copied and pasted to Elven Talk and translated back into the modern tongue.  Elven Talk works with text written in any language that uses the alphabetical characters A-Z.  Non-alphabetical characters or special characters are allowed but will not be given an Elven substitution.<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>- Give written words an Elven flare.<br/>- Copy and paste text to and from other apps.<br/>- Fun interface includes floating fireflies, falling leaves, and a sleeping tree.<br/>- A gentle shake of the device makes leaves fall from the tree.<br/>- Tap the tree\u2019s face to change its expression.<br/>- Selectable firefly density.<br/><br/>Please Note:  This app does not translate Elf languages from any popular books or movies.
