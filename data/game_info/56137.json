{"id": 56137, "slug": "nascar-dirt-to-daytona", "name": "NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona", "name_original": "NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona", "description": "<p>NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a racing simulator developed by Monster Games and published by Infogrames in November 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. It features NASCAR&#39;s Dodge Weekly Racing Series, Featherlite Modified Tour, Craftsman Truck Series, and the NASCAR Cup Series (originally Winston was the title sponsor but due to ESRB rating, all tobacco and alcohol related brands were censored). But Dodge Weekly Racing Series and Featherlite Modified Tour&#39;s all drivers were generic fantasy meanwhile the Craftsman Truck Series were also less real drivers. The unique feature of the player having to work one&#39;s way up through the ranks of tiers from the low tier Weekly Racing Series to the Cup series would later be used in EA Sports&#39; NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2002-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-22T04:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c33/c3377a6edf4360b0ea4d577277d4a553.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "GameCube"], "developers": ["Monster Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Infogrames", "Infogrames Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
