We decided to make a story driven game keeping in mind the subject of this event \u201cKeep it Alive\u201d. In our game you\u2019ll be playing as Noe trying to keep as many animals on the Arc as possible. Remember choices matter, they are going to guide you and hopefully make you laugh on the way.</p>\n<p>We created all the graphics.
