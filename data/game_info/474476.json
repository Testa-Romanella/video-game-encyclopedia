Make them count.</p>\n<p>How to play<br/>- Jump with O/Z.<br/>- Attack with X.<br/>- Hit enemies while they're not looking to defeat them quickly.<br/>- Press the jump button in the air near a grapple point to grapple to it. (Press up while grappled to reel in faster)<br/>- Hit targets with a star to open a nearby door.<br/>- Once you get the sword, you can switch weapons by pressing DOWN, then X while on the ground. (Current weapon is shown in the bottom left corner)<br/>- Use the sword to dash past searchlights without being caught.</p>\n<p>At the end of most levels, break the case and steal the gem to finish. But don't touch the case, it's covered in electricity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a2b7d3aaf22334d70c43d205c47a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["pixel shock"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
