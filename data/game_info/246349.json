You're a fun loathing god and you won't condone any of that devil worshipping and jazz lettuce. Your creations will feel your wrath as they're shattered into millions of tiny pieces until the power goes to your head and you destroy the planet. Takeaways: Looks super cool. Fun to make people explode. The emojis tell a hip narrative when pieced together (man sleeps with cake and his mom). A tactless metaphor for a power-hungry god and the silly concept of sin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec552f7e3a4f148dd20cca68d7731da1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["luckfiam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
