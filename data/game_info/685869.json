The new features I added primarily revolve around the clock prefab we made for our quiz. In this project the user gets to draw on the screen to the right side, they may clear it when they feel it is appropriate to do so. If the user loses sense of time while drawing because they are having too much fun, they can take a look to the left to read the clock that is provided. If they don\u2019t know how to tell time from a clock they can read the digital time below. I have even accommodated for people in other time zones by adding options for them and day light savings circumstances as well.\r\n      </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:35:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babf8cd2f54b33fed794ca9e012878c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["waqaspathan00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
