It makes use of dynamic camera angles, immersive vignettes,\u00a0\u00a0and interstitial narration in order to tell a very simple story:\u00a0the disaster and rescue of the Bristow Helicopters Flight 56C in January of 1995.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cullen</strong></em> was initially made for a specific call for games, but I\u00a0later realized I\u00a0had broken many rules of the project for which it was designed. So, it exists now as its own thing.</p>\n<p>(I'm currently having shader issues with my Mac build, so I'll add that after I\u00a0solve the problem.
