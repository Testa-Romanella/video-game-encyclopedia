This system was inspired by me sitting one night at work and watching the Yogscast play their Yogsquest tabletop game series and I wanted to make a quick, cheap, and easy system. And now that it's done, here it is!</p>\n<p>Included is a two-page document that details character creation, running the game. And a character sheet in .png format.</p>\n<p>While I'm offering this system out for free. Tips are always appreciated! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e94/e94d2e9c9bbf82eb06927a81c89c6168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuall\u00e1n"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
