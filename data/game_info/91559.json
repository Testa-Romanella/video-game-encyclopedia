When strangeness sets upon this humble town it is but a trifle matter as Sam and Joel set upon their quest to get the most time anticipated video game of the century: Moose Trooper 11. <br/>Along the way they\u2019ll meet new friends, old enemies, new enemies, little green forest critters called Goblims, politicians with a knack for war, superheroines, wizards, doctors, fleshy horrors, homeless people, homeless goblims,  rats,  walking heads with tails?, punks, robots,  mysterious merchants, owl people, pirates, hoodlums, mutants,  giant pigs, tentacles, skaters, the undead, knights, bullies, ghostly floating hands, sages, shopkeepers, bunch of other stuff, did you copy paste this text to see what it says?  Really I'm just typing stuff now to make it seem like a long list. There is really nothing of value here. Fine, there is a secret area in the very first room of the game! But shhh, don't tell anyone, it's out little secret. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>What is a chain game?\u00a0<br/></strong>Remember when you were a kid and played that game when you would fold a piece of paper, draw the start of a creature, and then fold it again and your friend would draw the next part? Then you'd do it back and forth a couple of time when finally you unfold it and look at your creation.\r\nA chain game is basically that: one person starts making a part of the game and when they feel it's reached a good point they sends it off to the next developer on the list. The end result might not always be the most polished game out there but it's an interesting journey where each part of the game bears the unique mark of it's developer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits\u00a0</strong><br/>Chapter 1:<strong>\u00a0</strong>Momeka<br/>Chapter 2: Fisherson<br/>Chapter 3: Donut<br/>Chapter 4: Moosetroop11<br/>Chapter 5: Prpl_Mage<br/>Post-Credits Game: Momeka</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e6198060b008247b534e0ae3351c2303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charas Project"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
