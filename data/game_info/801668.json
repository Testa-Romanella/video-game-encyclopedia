From creating your own Mecha, to creating your own weapons, to other things. Sure, it isn't anything too fancy, but it's something I can call my own. I'm always willing to take feedback. This is just something fun for everyone to do.\u00a0 (The Cover Image is\u00a0not mine; credit goes to the owner who made it.)<br/><br/>Of course, later down the line I'll probably update and add some things later on in the years. Let me know. I'm always willing to improve my stuff. :)<br/><br/>Edit: I changed and updated one of the rolls in the Armaments page. it was 8d6, but changed it to 6d8, to make it more fair for people who are fighting against European fighters who are using European based/Medieval Esque weaponry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T08:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84bd322fc481b61c29c4d77e6c76529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoverofDogs123"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
