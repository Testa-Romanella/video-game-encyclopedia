The theme was \"Roll of the Dice\" and I kinda took that literally.\u00a0 There are dice on the screen and you must destroy before their numbers overwhelm you! But watch out as each dice has their own effect that will try and prevent you from wiping them out!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>J or left click to fire<br/></p>\n<p>R to restart the game<br/></p>\n<p>Known Issues</p>\n<p>There are no sound effects when the player shoots or when a dice die.</p>\n<p>There's no \"beating\" the game. Nothing happens if you clear out all the dice. Just aim for a highscore.</p>\n<p>Also the game may get laggy and collisions can get weird when there are a lot of dice on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Spaceship: \u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/star-sparrow-modular-spa...</p>\n<p>Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-fr...</p>\n<p>Explosion Fx: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/war-fx-5669</p><p>Font - Into the void: \u00a0https://www.dafont.com/into-the-void.font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ade/adeff1534ce4a65c6804e97648cea9e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wafflefish"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
