Utilize different running speeds, jump heights, and bounce off of Powerwalls to maneuver around obstacles and reach the top of the map! Enjoy the climb with friends or by yourself. But be careful, as some jumps are more punishing than others...<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Challenging, yet addictive gameplay!</strong><br/><br/>While you can't stop running forward, hold the <strong>Slow</strong> key or the <strong>Fast</strong> key to adjust your running speed, and hit a wall to turn around (whether you want to or not). In addition, encounter fun modifiers like Powerwalls which allow you to kick off of a wall with a massive boost of speed! Make precise jumps over treacherous areas by yourself or with friends. And with hand-drawn art, you'll navigate the map through beautiful environments with colorful animations and effects!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Don't fear the fall...</strong><br/><br/>Whether you get distracted or make a mistake, falling will be unavoidable. With no checkpoints and instant autosave, you'll be forced to work your way back up to attempt a jump again. Some falls are small and won't punish you, while some are less forgiving. But fear not! The difficulty starts easy and increases over time, meaning the game is available to players of all skill levels! You'll hone your skills near the bottom so that you can overcome the obstacles above. As you near the top, the adrenaline and excitement you'll feel will be unlike any game you've played before!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The challenge is <strong>better with friends!</strong><br/><br/>Who doesn't love laughing at their friend's shortcomings?
