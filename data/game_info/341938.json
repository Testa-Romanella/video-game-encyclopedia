We get together every week for a 8-hours jam to experiment on the new opportunities in educational resources and collective intelligence.</p>\n<p>This time we wanted to work on COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE : how cooperation helps to go further and to reach a goal (or to rip eachother appart on the way there, it depends...). This game can be played all alone, but it will be WAY easier to have more brains and hands to escape this evil maze!</p>\n<p>We made this game in one \"8 hours Jam\", and will be very happy to hear your feedbacks about it. We hope you enjoy it! <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Made by Delphin Casado, Lola El Koubi, Tom Rivi\u00e8re and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Urien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T03:45:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c0/3c02aec0948423ecb1fd2bf9850cc89a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Savvy"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
