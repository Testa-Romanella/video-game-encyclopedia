No anti aliasing used. There is a fragmente shader running over the game that ensures that only two colors are displayed.</p>\n<p>The theme was LOOP, in the game, all the enemies are repeating the same attack over and over until they are damaged enought to die or switch their loop.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by Cuphead (we are huge fans of Cuphead), so it's very difficult. To ease your pain, please use a controller, there is also the easy mode which should be passable to everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>NB! There are some bugs with the WEB version for some reason, shooting sound effect is not as load and the tutorial automatically pauses the game. For the bes experience download the Windows version.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b97f9080a5f5e5eb71db10983abe1ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["internet8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
