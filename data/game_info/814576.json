Chef is out of ingredients so it's time to venture into the restaurant's dungeon to restock the larder with delicious monsters. Chef Quest is a tiny, action-oriented RPG of culinary delights.<br/></p>\n<p>Chef Quest was my entry for the RESET 64 4kb Competition (2018). Despite appearances and tiny file size\u00a0there's a bit of depth to how the game works (which confused most people, and is a good lesson that hopefully I\u00a0learn one day). It is highly recommended you read the instructions first before playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T12:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/1987ddf9e3fa034d46e78290602f9e65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antstiller"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
