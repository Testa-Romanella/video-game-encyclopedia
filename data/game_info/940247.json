The same goes for bugs, as I trust I accidentally left plenty!</p>\n<p>The game might not be much, but if you have a few minutes to spare, it is fun to get a new highscore, the game is not super challenging, but that doesn't mean it is a cakewalk.</p>\n<p>If you have a good score, good job! Share your score in the comments and maybe you can see how you compare to others! Or not, who knows, I just hope you have a little bit of fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Fantorim the Golden</p>\n\n<p>If you want to quite the game press ESC, if you want to play after you pressed ESC, just reload the page.</p>\n<p>Current game build: 1.2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T07:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6bfa94ee44bc0c45e3db5871e847d3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fantorim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
