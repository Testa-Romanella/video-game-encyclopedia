The full release is going to be Tuesday 5/1/19. It's a minimalistic platformer where your character is a frog whose objective is to eat flies. There are currently 12 levels to play through, and the game can be beaten in 15-20 minutes or so.</p>\n<p>The music is\u00a0<em>Hop Hop Master</em>\u00a0by Jonny Bartlett, created for this game.</p>\n<p>Oh, if you get stuck - unable to jump but you can still lick - please leave a comment.
