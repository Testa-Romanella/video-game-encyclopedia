It combines the elegance of Chinese ink painting with the beauty of music. We wish you could feel the depth of traditional Chinese art and enjoy the picturesque scenes of \"Jiangnan\" while playing this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is the first work produced by J.M.Arcady, an indie game team formed by undergraduates. We are dedicated to spreading the essence of Chinese culture through games.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne of the game's special features is that you can use our \u201crhythm generator\u201d to upload your own music and it will generate a corresponding beatmap automatically. The beatmap is written in the form of JSON and allows manual modifications.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T15:39:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa9/aa9ad6750f702e40cf14292f02e228fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["J.M.ARCADY"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["J.M.ARCADY"], "esrb_rating": null}
