We collect space garbage, but not just any garbage, only garbage that could be well paid. The main objective of our company is to search for onboard recorders on abandoned space stations.

To do so, you should solve physical puzzles, avoid traps and interact with environment.<br/><br/>Puzzles can be solved in different ways, but some actions lead to a dead end or even a fatal outcome.
