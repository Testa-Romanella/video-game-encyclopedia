This is an expansion to the world of SENSELESS CITY, first introduced in the puzzle game I released last year. You can find the first SENSELESS CITY game here:<br/>https://destroyed4com4t.itch.io/senseless-city<br/><br/>It's a visual novel, built around a widely expanded version of Nightendushi's VNES-ENGINE, which I converted to CNROM mapper from the original NROM to be able to add more characters as well as expanding the scripting language to accommodate music and background changes as well as an inventory system. If you wanna try your hand at Nightendushi's original engine, it is here:<br/>https://github.com/NightenDushi/VNES_Engine<br/><br/>It's still very obviously a demo at this point. I expect the finished game to be a 96KB CNROM, which will make it the second one in existence after Bubble Bath Babes, lol. After this I will probably make a crunched down version of the engine with smaller characters and more detailed backgrounds for future games but I just really wanted to stick with the idea of giant characters in this one because they looked so good.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T07:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da7/da751b433ce169158388220ee1255438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
