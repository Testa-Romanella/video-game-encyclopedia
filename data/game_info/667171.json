{"id": 667171, "slug": "toys-on-fire", "name": "Toys on Fire", "name_original": "Toys on Fire", "description": "<p><strong>Toys On Fire</strong> is a small arcade game in which you control a tiny but fast RC fire truck saving a town made out of toys from fire and chaos in a battle against time. <br/></p>\n<p>Drive all over town as you try to put out each fire as it spawns, finding the quickest route as you go. Earn points and bonus time for each fire you extinguish successfully, but careful, a burned down house means you lose both time and points too. Randomly spawned power ups can help you prolong your run and gain a new high score! <br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arcade style vehicle controls<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Random powerups</strong></li><li><strong>A small town built out of toys</strong></li><li><strong>Beat your best score<br/></strong></li><li><strong>\"No Mistakes\" mode where a single burned down house ends your run!<br/></strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Using\u00a0a\u00a0gamepad\u00a0is\u00a0STRONGLY\u00a0recommended!\u00a0</strong>While the game offers keyboard controls, they are unprecise in comparison and nowhere near as fun as playing with a gamepad. Also, the Dualshock 4 and Dualsense controllers are supported natively. If you are using DS4Window or comparable software, I recommend turning it off. <br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD or Left Stick + Triggers = Steering/Gas/Brake<br/>Arrowkeys or Right Stick = Aim/Shoot water cannon<br/>Escape or Start Button = Pause/Unpause<br/>Select Button = Take screenshot</p>\n<p>The Asset bundle you can buy contains most if not all of the meshes and textures from this game that I made myself. You can use them freely for commercial and non commercial projects, and credits are not required.\u00a0 It's 42x FBX files (although a bunch are different road/dirt/etc tiles.) and the corresponding textures. Plus some tileable textures and sprites/particles! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d14f4019d227dc0bc109de810abf74c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ChocoMint Softworks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
