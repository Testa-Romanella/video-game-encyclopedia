It's barely even interactive. But I'm uploading it for fun, posterity, future development, etc. :)\r\n<p>This is my incomplete submission for the February 2023 Action Button Goblin Game Jam (theme: there and back again).<br/></p>\n<p>The idea of the game is:</p>\n<p>You are a little dino guy who wants to grab treasure and return home. You traverse to the treasure along a single line of tiles. You pick which tiles are next (perhaps 3 at a time or something like that) in order to manage risk to health/gold and possible rewards. Tiles can have special events, such as bandits attacking you on the open road, or monsters attacking you on a grassy path, or finding extra treasure/gear in the hostile mountains!</p>\n<p>Once you reach the treasure, you must make it home with the treasure through the same tiles you set up previously. I would like the tiles to behave slightly differently and to have slightly different incentives for the journey home, perhaps related to protecting your treasure.</p>\n<p>I intend to continue working on this after the jam to flesh out all of the core ideas :)<br/></p>\n<p>Credit for stuff other people made that I used:</p>\n\r\nThank you to Arks for the lovely dino sprites :) <br/>https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters\r\nThanks to CosmicGiant and editors for their implementation of the dreaded Singleton <br/>https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/151547", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T04:50:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59f/59fb4cb0b9708dc8dc8a7a7e1db26baa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zednaught"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
