Majestic Mega Supporter Bundle", "description": "<p><strong>Mr. Fisk has been taken!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Finding himself in a completely unknown location, Mr. Fisk must make his way up a mountain to get back home to his lake, but climbing is a challenge for a salmon not used to moving on dry land.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Go Home, Mr. Fisk! is a challenging (im)precision platformer, where a single mistake may bring you all the way back to the beginning. Mr. Fisk is a clumsy and poorly maneuverable fish out of water, faced with the task of finding his way up a surreal mountain inhabited by other sea life. There are a number of equally valid routes up, the way you climb is up to you! Explore the mountain for secrets and routes leading forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Simple yet challenging platforming mechanics.</li><li>A dynamic soundtrack that changes alongside your progress.</li><li>Hats and other similar accessories to find and equip on Mr. Fisk.</li><li>Secrets, references, and dumb jokes to discover and enjoy.</li><li>Two proper endings, as well as another poorly hidden one to find.</li></ul>\n<p>This bundle version is meant for people who enjoy \"Go Home, Mr. Fisk\" more than is sensible, and wish to support Klothscape's future endeavors. It does not radically alter the game or contain more playable content, the entire game itself is available on Steam for free right now.</p>\n<p><strong>What is different from the basic version:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>An additional accessory in the game: a majestic crown and cape for the true king fishies among you, automatically unlocked upon purchase.</li><li>The OST, along with the right to use it any way you want to. We only hope you credit us if you do use it for your own creative ventures, and would love it if you shared your work with us too.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T06:55:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/64441aa5ca6d200b2f6154e8b4ab3831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klothscape"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
