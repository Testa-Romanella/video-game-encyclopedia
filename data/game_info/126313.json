{"id": 126313, "slug": "crowd-eraser", "name": "Crowd Eraser", "name_original": "Crowd Eraser", "description": "<p>A small match-3 rogue-lite made in scraps of free time throughout a week for the 2016 7DRL (Seven Day Rogue-Like) challenge.</p><p>Latest update: March 20th, 2016 (just fixing some annoying bugs)</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>- Arrow Keys / WASD / Numpad to move/attack.</p><p>- Spacebar to wait or go up/down stairs.</p><p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p><p>Around your character, there is a highlighted grid. Within this grid, \"match 3\" rules apply: if three or more things in a straight line have the same symbol/color, they will be erased. This includes walls, people, and you.</p><p>Other people will begin to chase you if you wander close enough. If they are next to you, they will try to change your symbol/color to match theirs. If you attack them, they will generally disappear.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Built with Unity: https://unity3d.com/</p><p>Makes use of the ROG framework, from the Unity Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/52479</p><p><strong>Jam Notes</strong></p><p>I started with: </p><p>- Unity 5.3</p><p>- version 1.21 of the ROG framework ($30 from the Unity Asset Store)</p><p>- a few small scripts I made while trying to learn ROG before the jam</p><p>- some generic bits &amp; bobs (code + the pixel font) from previous projects</p><p>I might've inadvertently cheated by some hours as my weekends have been busy and I didn't mark exactly when I started (at the time, I didn't expect to make any real progress, given the amount of other stuff in my schedule). Total hours actually engaged with the project are definitely on the low end.</p><p>Sadly, most of the proper rogue-like bits had to be cut, due to lack of time.</p><p>Since the deadline, I've uploaded a new build that fixes some awkward bugs. If for some reason you are compelled to play the slightly buggy version, I've left that one up for a little longer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f405205366e29570d2cf5a3bca904eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mr. a"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
