{"id": 448258, "slug": "eq-app", "name": "EQ App", "name_original": "EQ App", "description": "<p><strong>The EQ App</strong> is an interactive astronomical, space-based simulator of setup and working with telescopes equatorial mounts and simple astronavigation on reference stars. The application will help astronomy enthusiasts to figure out how to orient the telescope on the equatorial mount for observations and how the \u201cdrift\u201d method works for accurately telescope orientation. You will learn how to navigate under the night sky using the reference stars in an interactive form and see a lot of interesting things in the process of preparing for astronomical observations using this application.</p>\n<p><strong>Three types of telescopes are available</strong> in the application, which will help to understand how the equatorial and fork mounts work, why the telescope can follow the star and how to quickly prepare the telescope for work under the starry sky.</p>\n<p>For more experienced astronomy enthusiasts and astrophotography enthusiasts, it will be useful to practice the precise alignment of the equatorial mount using the star's<strong> \u201cdrift\u201d method</strong>.</p>\n<p>The application uses a pleasant<strong> low-poly style of graphics</strong>, which will not distract from the perception of information.</p>\n<p>For beginners, astronomy enthusiasts, the application has interactive lectures, from which you can learn in a game form information about how to prepare for observations and how to find interesting objects in the sky without using cheat sheets in the form of applications on mobile devices. There are several demonstration modes: the telescope setup mode and the observation mode under the night sky, where the view of the star dome is as close as possible to the real observation conditions.</p>\n<p>The starry sky in the application displays real constellations and some objects of deep space. Using this map, you can learn to find your first objects in the sky for initial observations.</p>\n<p>The application is translated and voiced in 2 languages: <strong>Russian and English</strong>.</p>\n<p>For fans to get the most out of interactivity, an achievement system is provided.</p>\n<p>One of the missions of this astronomical encyclopedia is to inspire the viewer for new discoveries. A short film available in the main menu will help the viewer decide that for him astronomical observations are: romance or serious science.</p>\n<p>In order not to get confused and remember the location of the objects studied in the application, navigation maps for reference stars are available in the distribution package, which you can print.</p>\n<p>All new discoveries in the application will be accompanied by a pleasant and <strong>calm music.</strong></p>\n<p>Look for information about where to download this application on the official page http://www.eqapp.vistavideo.ru/ and in the social networks: https://vk.com/eqapp</p>\n<p><strong><em>I wish you a pleasant pastime and clear skies in the interactive simulator EQ APP!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7eab9aef31818426f4de2df947bc3bd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["iLivesey"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
