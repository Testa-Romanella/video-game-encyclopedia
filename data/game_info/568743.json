Even worse, he is stuck in level 1 until he touches the orb at the end of the level. Even worse than that, every time he dies he <strong>progresses </strong>to the next level and grows further away from his precious phone.<br/></p>\n<p>Jump and dodge through a facility full of evil robots and deadly acid and get the orbs to go back or uncomple the previous level.\u00a0 A and D or Arrow keys to move and space to jump. Good luck, you\u2019ll need it!</p>\n<p>Thanks to pzUH for the character, robot, tileset, and orb, to CTatz for making the phone, and to https://cooltext.com/ for the font I used.
