My Love2D project that has been going on for months!<br/>It's basically a sokoban clone but with some gimmicks.</p>\n<p>Now, how do you operate the engine? Simple, every level pack, made by me or the community (if there is one), is a folder with an \"index.txt\" file, you open up the game and drag the \"index.txt\" file onto the game window. You play with arrow keys and you can reset the level with the \"R\" key. I assume most mechanics are intuitive.</p>\n<p>Now, i've also attached the tutorial level pack so you can learn the game, more level packs coming soon i hope<br/><br/>But what if you want to make levels? You can use the attached Sokobad Editor (instructions are in the program)<br/><br/>If you made something with it, be sure to contact me on discord!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T17:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/8970adf098ac4971d577b79df7ab24f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leol22"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
