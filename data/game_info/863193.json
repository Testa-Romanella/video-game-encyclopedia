Thanksgiving Day.\u00a0\u00a012 P.M.</em></p>\n<p><em>The city wakes up oblivious to what happens in it. Its streets wake up with the first rays of the morning with a festive and jovial atmosphere in them, it is Thanksgiving Day.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, the celebration will look tarnished, because while the whole city keeps its attention at the parade, across the main street, away, on the bank center of the city it can be heard the tires skidding in the driveway.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>Several men break into it and with violence, they take possession of the bank. A plan like that would not admit any mistake, but that's why there are men like you, to prevent that they reach their goal.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>John E. Scott is the name recorded on your Inspector badge. The age that your gray hair marks in the sides of your cropped hair shines as your experience. And your ability to hold cold blood in the worst situations has catapulted you to your actual position: you are the skilled negotiator of the Austin City Police Department. you are the man they call when situations have been crooked too much to want to hide your head under the ground.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>The man who takes out the garbage and cleans the city of scum like the one that is robbing the city bank today. The place where the honest people deposit the sweat of their force and work.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>With very few units available to be deployed, most of them watch the parade, entering the bank has been the easiest thing that those rats have done in their lives, and that has in them a confidence that you want and must fragment until they beg.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>You still have very little information. You know they've taken hostages. You don't know if someone is hurt, need assistance or if they have taken a life. The life of someone who was been waited at the table of his house to celebrate today.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>They cannot go unpunished.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>You take a seat inside the police van. At your table, that damn device of the devil.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>When have you consented not to let you in to talk to them? You didn't even need a megaphone in your life.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>You light a cigarette and the smoke blurs the atmosphere. You turn off the radio, you look at the map and pencil in hand you make the first call inside the bank.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>Here starts your negotiation:\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>-I'm Inspector John Scott, boy... the one in charge to find a quick solution...\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>-With experience, you handle the call with restraint before hanging up.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>You sigh and before you can stand up... the phone rings.\r\n  </em></p>\n<p><em>You have a call.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b4a69d00f67d74ab3dea902f026b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dp3rucha"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
