This is meant to give those who download it a sense of what to expect from this project, feature-wise.<br/><br/>I am taking donations of any amount in order to help fund the progress of this game, as well as future titles. The full game (once it is released) will be $5, any demos I make for it will always be free.<br/><br/>This demo starts from the beginning of the game (no title screen added just yet) and ends once you defeat the first mini-boss (Giant Scorpion).<br/><br/>I have big plans for this game, so stay tuned for great things!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>---Gamepad (Xbox 360 controller style)---<br/>A = Jump<br/>X = shoot (once the Red Blaster is obtained)<br/>START = pause menu<br/>D-Pad = move<br/>LT = run<br/><br/></p>\n<p>---Keyboard---</p>\n<p>left / right arrow keys = move<br/>C = shoot (once the Red Blaster is obtained)<br/>SPACE = jump<br/>D = run<br/>ESCAPE\u00a0 = pause menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538953638ce83c5ff818a13db7b3d995.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glyphic Enigma"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
