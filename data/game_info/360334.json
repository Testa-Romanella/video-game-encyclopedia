But if it reaches zero you die.</p>\n<p>On top of that you can only get healed at a safe zone, and that is also where you can save, and get change your passive skill that goes with your main skill bolt. There are 6 passives and you can use only 1 of them to your advantage. Your skill bolt, is your only skill you can use.
