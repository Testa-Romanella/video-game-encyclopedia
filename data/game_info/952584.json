Delve into The Grand Instruments: massive and perilous\u00a0musical structures, long dormant until the main character's use of musical magic awakens them.\u00a0What purpose do they serve? Who has set these events into motion, and why?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This prototype was released in 2022. I've made many improvements and changes since then.
