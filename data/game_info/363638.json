Before you rush into battle, you should become stronger. First, your character will be armed with a small sword. While you are at the initial stage you need to collect experience in the form of multi-colored grains, which are scattered throughout the game map. Also, do not engage in battle with other players until you are only at the first level. Once you raise your level enough, then your character will be with more powerful weapons. Then you can engage with other players. To take the lead you need to destroy a large number of enemies and maximize your level. Enjoy the game and good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:30:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab4/ab44c059fa70b5c32c96273712713cf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nobius"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
