{"id": 704654, "slug": "survival-girls", "name": "Survival Girls", "name_original": "Survival Girls", "description": "SURVIVAL GIRLS is my tribute game to one of my favorite games, RUST. You live on an island and need to stay alive with food and water. You build your base and defend it from others, craft items and weapons for your base, build an ATV, Snowmobile or car to race around the island. Survival Girls is focused mainly on crafting, building and raiding other players compounds!  Search and collect various plants and materials to craft guns and vehicles (and soon to tame animals). The game is in a very early state and I intend to add more animals and AI and other features like air drops and  events . I also would like to hear from you, the players, and try and include as many of your suggestions into the game as possible. I am a Solo dev and this is my FIRST GAME! I hope you enjoy my efforts and have a good time Surviving Girl!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-09T21:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/6565403e69165a9cfdaf4697d86fd95d.jpg", "website": "https://www.redsquirreltributegames.rocks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Squirrel Tribute Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Red Squirrel Tribute Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
