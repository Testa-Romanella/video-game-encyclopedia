It is a short point and click adventure where you can travel between rooms by clicking on certain text.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT- If you are sensitive to slightly flashy visuals, press  \u201cTAB\u201d to turn off wild room transitions. A small symbol with an X will  appear in the top right corner confirming the change.\r\n</p>\n<p>Asides the usual clicking, controls are: <br/></p>\n<p>-&gt;TAB to toggle wild room transitions <br/></p>\n<p>-&gt;ESC to exit the game <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Something that might be worth noting,  there is an inventory system, but it is a very simple one where you  don\u2019t need to click on the item or drag it to use it on another and  there is no combining of items. If you click on something you can pick  up, it is picked up automatically and shown in the top left corner, and  if there is something that item is to interact with, if you click on  that item and the necessary object is in your inventory it will  automatically use it.\r\n</p>\n<p>TOOLS <br/></p>\n<p>Gamemaker Studio 2 <br/></p>\n<p>Gimp <br/></p>\n<p>Aseprite <br/></p>\n<p>Protools\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Story, Art and Programming by Leanne Rath (it'sa me, Realtanhen!)</p>\n<p>Music and Sound by Kris Silver (https://soundcloud.com/krissilver92)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0aceefba48c0d042b5b7897e8742197a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RealTanHen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
