We in Snigelsnugel are a group of students who made this game during a 7 week (including Christmas- and new years-weeks) long project at Sk\u00f6vde University, as part of the game development programs. We will not update the game and it lacks a few things like a pause-menu, a way to close the game and such. Though it does automatically save your progress.</p>\n<p>We are very proud in our creation, despite its flaws, and decided to share this immaculate experience with the rest of the world. While a bit buggy and imperfect, we managed to create some interesting mechanics and areas, including a sling-shot and ground-pound mechanic, with a fluent control-scheme to boot. Explore many areas as Snail and look for many hidden secrets!</p>\n<p>The story of the game has many layers to it, which may be difficult for many to grasp. It starts off with Snail, who is in debt after neglecting to pay their rent to the mafia. The mafia are angry about this, and threaten to kill Snail. Now, Snail has to find golden doubloons with which to pay their rent with, all while watching out for the mafia's goons. The world is a strange one, with many characters that seek to aid Snail in their quest. Help Snail survive another day by collecting Blueberries\u2122, Gems and a few more things to get the doubloons they need!</p>\n<p>To make the game we used sounds from the website www.freesound.org, and used some assets from Unity's template \"FPS Microgame\". We also used Fungus, and some assets given to us by Sk\u00f6vde University.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:36:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bedc19dbf625bfd3763fdf6d9734e50e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snigelsnugel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
