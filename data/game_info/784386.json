This is a faithful port/remake of the original game, which was a launch title for the Nintendo DSi, originally released outside of Japan in 2009.\u00a0 The DSiWare original itself\u00a0is also\u00a0a port of the mini-game \"Pyoro\" from the first WarioWare title on the Gameboy Advance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0do not own the original music or gameplay, as those are all copyrighted by Nintendo. I developed this remake purely for fun to learn the Playdate SDK, and am not asking for any money. Instead, you can buy the original game on the 3DS eShop for $1.99 until the shop shuts down in March 2023. If there's enough interest, I may develop a spiritual successor to the game that avoids the use of copyrighted assets.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>All the classic Pyoro gameplay you know and love</li><li>1-bit remakes of all the original sprites</li><li>Optional crank controls for Pyoro's tongue</li><li>Dynamic soundtrack</li><li>True-to-the-original tongue physics</li><li>High score tracking\u00a0</li><li>Verified to run great on device!</li></ul>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Please feel free to share any feedback, high scores, or bug reports in the comments below.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T11:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e3ed13b45fe47e78c475427af51d38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madvogel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
