Anyone caught out is likely to be torn apart. Nothing can keep them away.</p>\n<p>Nothing, that is, except you, your werewolf-proof bunker, and your semi-automatic shotgun loaded with custom silver-tipped slugs. As you watch the moon rise, be on the lookout for survivors trying to make it to safety, and be ready to protect them. Their lives depend on it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p>This game was written for GitHub Game Off 2020, where the theme was \u201cMoonshot\u201d. On the literal level, it\u2019s a game about werewolves that come out on the full moon, and you have to shoot them. Figuratively, trying to save hapless people from your bunker is something of a moonshot\u2014an ambitious and perhaps impractical goal.</p>\n<p>On the meta level, this whole project is a moonshot. I\u2019m a high school teacher on the back end of my 30s; despite grand intentions, I haven\u2019t made anything more than a flimsy prototype of a game in many years. So, making a game in a month? Learning a new library to do it? Sign me up!<br/></p>\n<p>You can judge for yourself how successful I was. Yeah, it\u2019s very buggy; yeah, the \u201cplaceholder\u201d art never got upgraded; yeah, the \u201cOptions\u201d menu doesn\u2019t work\u2026 But <strong>I did it</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits\u00a0and\u00a0Licence</strong></p>\n\n<p>Code is licensed under the GNU General Public License 3.0 or later.
