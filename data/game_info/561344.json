I recently played a game called Shieldwall and liked it a lot.\u00a0 Thought it would fit the theme and this jam could be a nice learning experience for me. And it did :)</p>\n<p>I want to change a loooot of things; but I guess I will have to do all those sometime after the jam is over. For now,\u00a0I only had 2.5 days to develop, so I couldn't complete the game even with the help of art assets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It still feels nice to run around with the army, so I submitted :)</p>\n<p>Hope you like it.</p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>GAMEPLAY</strong>\u00a0--------</p>\n<p>Capture points (tents) by being the majority in their range.</p>\n<p>Once they are captured, they will start soldiers for the respective owner. Every point has a different production cap and rate.</p>\n<p>More soldiers can help you to capture points faster and be the majority.</p>\n<p>You can command your army to be in a certain formation or stay at certain point. Enemy leader will do the same.</p>\n<p>You would clash your armies and fight to the death... But, I didn't have time to develop that part :)</p>\n<p>So right now, there is no \"game\" to be played to be honest. But it is still fun to hang around, so I submitted it.</p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>CONTROLS\u00a0</strong>--------</p>\n<p><strong>Movement :\u00a0</strong>A W S D</p>\n<p>Jump\u00a0 / Double Jump\u00a0: Spacebar</p>\n<p><strong>Left Shift Hold\u00a0 :</strong>\u00a0Run</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Click :</strong>\u00a0Attack ( It doesn't do anything right now\u00a0)</p>\n<p><strong>Call\u00a0To Arms Formations\u00a0: 1 ( Grid ), 2 (Circle) , 3 (\u00a0 Triangle )</strong></p>\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>USED ASSETS\u00a0</strong>--------</p>\n<p>Low Poly Medieval Weapons\u00a0Pack</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/lowpoly-medieval-weapons-...</p>\n<p>Polyverse Low Poly Sky</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/polyverse-skies-low-poly-skybo...</p>\n<p>Tents are from Synty\u00a0Knights Package</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/polygon-knights-pa...</p>\n<p>A* Pathfinding Algorithms for Multithreaded Calculations</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/a-pathfinding-project-pro-87744</p>\n<p>Sculpted the terrain with the\u00a0Polaris module</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/low-poly-terrain-polaris-202...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a546f47ec6232ee869d211546e2f9e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmetahaydemir"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
