I joined when there was 3 hours left so I opened up an old project and got to work. It was really stressful to say the least. I will post a video soon about the making of it so check back on this page in a few days if you are interested.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>That is a good question. It is a complete mess and has a few bugs that I know of so for my sake just ignore them because I will just pretend they were intentional. Anyway, thanks for playing and I hope you worked out how to play the game because I am way too tired to explain it.</p>\n\n<p>Ok goodbye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/174a6426c8e0fbdd8de95ef4b58697ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wow_Games_Created"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
