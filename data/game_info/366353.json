There was no story to get in the way, no stats to remember, no confusing gameplay. Just gems and enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's my Birthday today (18th of August) and I wanted to release a simple game where you had to collect gems and avoid enemies before the time runs out.\u00a0This is a minimalist game, don\u2019t expect to be able to write long evolved essays on the gameplay on this one.</p>\n<p>However, I had to do something to bring it into the 21st century so this is a 6 degree of Freedom (i.e. flying around in 3D space) game where all the levels are procedurally generated. Even the music is procedurally generated using a custom AI music generator which is literally composing the music as you play. It may get some notes wrong sometimes, this is the first time it has been used in a game, so it may be a little nervous!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play -\u00a0You need a Joypad to play this game at the moment!</strong></p>\n<p>The controls are simple, left stick moves you forwards or backwards and allows you to strafe left or right. The right stick allows you to look around. Use the shoulder buttons on the controller to roll left and right.\u00a0Press 'start' or whatever your equivalent is to access the pause menu where you can invert the Y axis.</p>\n<p>\r\nOh, nearly forgot: don't let the enemies touch you, you'll notice when they are about to as the environment will turn red. If they do touch you, they take a lot of time from you.\u00a0Don't worry though, each gem you collect will give you back time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wow, nearly forgot this one too: Gems can be hard to find on the later levels to give you a bit of a hand if you press 'A' or 'X' on your joypad each gem will show a little locator that helps you track it. You only get 5 goes at this so use them wisely and they fade out over 2 minutes. \u00a0Also, if you're in your last 2 minutes on some of the larger levels they will automatically come on to give you that last bit of help!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd20e5f5ba6f9b6cc0c31dd64ac09e7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["xiotex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
