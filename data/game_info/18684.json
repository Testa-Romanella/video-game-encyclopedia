Unique enemy sequences and attack patterns will overlap with each other to challenge the player's reflexes and quick decision making. Will you risk losing a life for the sake of a few hundred extra score points, or will you choose a less rewarding, but safer maneuver?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA single bullet hit will cost you a life, after all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d38befadc8c66b22b63cb1a569abae.jpg", "website": "http://kircode.com/hypnorain/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keyreal"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["keyreal"], "esrb_rating": null}
