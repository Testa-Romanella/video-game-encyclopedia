Level 2 cannot be played until Level 1 is beaten, and\u00a0Level 3 cannot be played until Level 2 is beaten. Upon exiting the game, all progress is lost.</strong><br/><br/>Metal Melody is a 2D Rhythm game where you play as Von, a struggling ex-musician in need of some quick cash, who will\u00a0compete in a tournament to win a large cash prize. The competition won\u2019t be easy, and your enemies will try to defeat you by any means necessary. Luckily, you have various abilities that can be used in battle to your advantage, so give it your all!<br/></p>\n<p>The Lobby: This is where your journey begins, and where you will be sent after each battle. There is no challenge here, so use this time to relax, or speak to the various NPCs hanging around who may have some useful info for you. When you\u2019re ready, head over to the bouncer, who will bring you to the battle.\r\n</p>\n<p>Battles: This is where your skills will be put to the test. Hit the oncoming notes on the screen to charge your Power Gauge, which will activate its selected ability on a full charge. Be careful though, because if the Power Gauge drops to 0%, you\u2019ll take damage! Your enemies will also try to attack you at various moments, so be sure to keep an eye out for dodge notes, and hit them when they appear!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each level will be more challenging than the last. Do you think you have what it takes to make it to the top?</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Lobby - WASD/Arrow Keys to move, MOUSE1 to select level / close dialog, E to interact.</p>\n<p>Battle - ESC to pause, MOUSE1 to close tutorial (Level 1) / select menu option, Arrow Keys to hit notes, Q &amp; E to switch abilities.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TEAM:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming - Thomas Gordon (https://dova14.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Soundtrack - Jeremy Cooney (https://defectivescrub.itch.io), @joeiswoa (https://open.spotify.com/artist/14gMQJgpGMUpZPCym5c73Y), Philippe Tanguay</p>\n<p>Design - Thomas Gordon, Jeremy Cooney</p>\n<p>Art - MJ Lawrence</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T16:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1806d1ea32a4d18b59fe052c8386ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DefectiveScrub", "Dova14"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
