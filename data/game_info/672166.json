{"id": 672166, "slug": "crystalgrab", "name": "Crystalgrab", "name_original": "Crystalgrab", "description": "<p>Made for a programming class I'm taking through Coursera.\u00a0</p><p>Created by Jeremy Anderson, 2021</p><p>Using assets from MSU Gel Lab, 2020</p><p>Changes to base mechanics include:<br/></p><p>1) Instead of health blocks there is a health bar, allowing different enemies to deal different amounts of damage, and acid to deal damage over time.<br/>2)\u00a0Acid deals 1 damage every 0.1 seconds (real time)\u00a0rather than setting off the usual multiple seconds of i-frames.<br/>3) You can always activate jump while in acid. This is useful if you fall into the Death Bowl, as well as in the bonus zone where physics get a little wonky.<br/>4)\u00a0The level is extensive, including a variety of challenges to test your skills.<br/>5)\u00a0You can hop through vents by pressing the up button (or pushing the thumbstick farther north than the NW/NE intercardinals). Vents animate when you walk in front of them, and their corresponding vent opens as well to let you know where they exit...if It's on the same screen as you.<br/>6) You can also activate the vents remotely, and use them to get robots out of your way...or to move them somewhere useful for you!<br/>7) As a minor change, robots take no damage from being jumped on and always bounce you 1.5 times your normal height. This makes them useful for puzzles.<br/>8) To avoid having players accidentally solve or ruin puzzles on the opposite side of the map, your vent activation is a 9-unit radius; roughly your field of view.<br/>9) Tiny change:\u00a0Because the game consists of one giant level, I removed the Level Select button from the main menu.<br/>10) Collecting a crystal doesn't just add to your score; It also heals you AND increases your maximum health! The health bar itself extends as you grab crystals, to reflect this.<br/>11) Collecting all 30 crystals in the level requires a bit of tricky jumping and patience for a rather devious puzzle I included. But if you do it, that's an alternate victory condition and you don't have to traverse the map to the regular exit after achieving it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T08:57:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a024bb7494f14e15306fc503a4fe87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["karishi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
