The hue-tiful blobs are attacking! Survive as long as possible before you're OVERLOADED by the mob.</p>\n<p>Destroy a blob by shooting it with the same colored bullet. Be careful though... shooting them\u00a0with the wrong color only makes them TWICE as mad! So first, make sure to scan in the right color with your laser beam.</p>\n<p>Extra CHAOS: Good luck with Slime Wheel's special bonuses...</p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Controls\r\n<ul><li>WASD moves your character\u00a0</li><li>Mouse aims bullets and laser</li><li>Right-click to scan enemy\u00a0color.
