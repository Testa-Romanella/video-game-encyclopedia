{"id": 979643, "slug": "folkorigin", "name": "FolkOrigin", "name_original": "FolkOrigin", "description": "...is an RTS game with RPG elements, where the entire world is set on a 2D hexagonal map. The main objective is to expand the settlement in a way that ensures production and extraction of as many resources available on the map as possible. Well-planned allocation of workforce results in effective resource acquisition necessary for trade, enriching our settlement, and providing units with the ability to craft items that enhance their individual characteristics. A well-trained and equipped unit is key to defending the settlement, conquering successive zones on the map, and surviving in a world full of Slavic monsters.<br/><br/><br/>Work on the project began in September 2023. Together with my younger brother, we are creating a game where he focuses on 2D graphics - drawing buildings, landscapes, characters, and other elements, while I handle the remaining aspects of production - coding, testing, writing game content, publishing, creating trailers, and much more.<br/>Our project, the game, has been made available in early access to showcase what we're working on and gather constructive feedback to help us develop the project in the best possible way, eliminating errors and refining gameplay.<br/>Overall, we're working on a game that we've dreamed of and want to play ourselves :)<br/><br/><br/>\u2022  29 buildings to construct<br/>\u2022  24 resources<br/>\u2022  41 different items in the inventory<br/>\u2022  21 enemy units<br/>\u2022  11 recruitable units<br/>\u2022  mode: <strong>Tutorial</strong> - Tutorial mode is a gameplay mode where the player is introduced step by step to the basic mechanics related to settlement development. The tutorial is continuously updated.<br/>\u2022  mode: <strong>Free Play</strong> - Free play mode is a gameplay mode where the player develops their settlement in any way they choose, with no time constraints, main objective, or opponent to thwart their plans. It is the best way to independently acquaint oneself with the game. However, it's essential to build the settlement in a way that prepares for upcoming threats, such as bandits and Slavic demons.<br/><br/><br/>\u2022  Adding/improving animations and appearances of buildings and characters *<br/>\u2022  Landscape diversity *<br/>\u2022  Stat-boosting amulets *<br/>\u2022  Runes granting special abilities **<br/>\u2022  Linux and Mac version **<br/>\u2022  Refinement of UI panel layouts and buttons **<br/>\u2022  Enhancement of tooltip content **<br/>\u2022  Summary of completed gameplay **<br/>\u2022  BALANCE of resource/item/unit valuation **<br/>\u2022  Crafting - item manufacturing ***<br/>\u2022  Ambient, sound effects ***<br/><br/><br/>\u2022  Steam achievements **<br/>\u2022  ability to recruit exotic units **<br/>\u2022  individual unit skills ***<br/>\u2022  game save system ***<br/>\u2022  weapon crafting ***<br/>\u2022  construction of defensive buildings ***<br/>\u2022  gameplay mode: hunting ****<br/>\u2022  gameplay mode: survival ****<br/>\u2022  gameplay mode: map domination - multiplayer ***** !!!<br/><br/>(\u2217 - level of difficulty of execution)<br/><br/>Music \ud834\udd1e - AlkaKrab", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T09:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/144/14461d032814a0f99b77ac70b3ef52af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LDSG88 Lukasz Dolata"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["LDSG88 Lukasz Dolata"], "esrb_rating": null}
