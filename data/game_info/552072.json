Beware though - Hagatha only has 40 bucks and vendors can only deal with so much of her bullcrap. It\u2019s on you to talk the vendors down so that you can make your money last and help Hagatha get back to walking around telling people to go back to their own dimension.<br/></p>\n<p>Move with arrow keys and press Space to slice. Slice discount tags to reduce the price and save money. Getting hit by projectiles will cause vendors to lose patience.
