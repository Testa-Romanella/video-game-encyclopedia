I didn't have a whole lot of time, and I basically made this game in like a few hours just before the deadline, but it still works (atleast kind of :)). All of the art is made by me (big surprise) and the code is also written within the deadline! Please remember that this game is pretty crappy, because I made it with sfml and c++ in which I have very limited experience with, so I didn't have time to add a splash screen, menu or sounds. Thanks! :D</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>\n<p>You're a chicken, and you need to <strong>prevent </strong>the <strong>falling big\u00a0egg</strong> from <strong>falling down</strong> and breaking.
