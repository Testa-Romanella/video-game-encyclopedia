The optional theme was: Change.</p>\n<p>I've made several ship generators before. One in Adobe Flash and one in Javascript for JS1k. Procedural Generation is a fascinating topic and there are so many cool ideas for things you can make.</p>\n<p>The spaceships are generated from stacking together different sprites from a large collection of pre-drawn basic shapes. Various operations are performed on the ship such as painting a new material over it, creating sub-sections of the ship which are then repeatedly copied, randomly increasing the height of parts of the ship, and so on. At the end a bunch of accessories are attached to the ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong><br/> </p>\n<p>\"8Bit sounds \u00bb gun9.wav\" by Tissman licensed under CC0 1.0<br/>\"Return of the Mars Mission.wav\" by esistnichtsoernst licensed under CC0 1.0<br/>\"Retro_Explosion_07.wav\" by MATRIXXX_ licensed under CC0 1.0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/99734f8c794cbcd1a584b1d8aa3e9c34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donitz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
