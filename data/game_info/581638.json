{"id": 581638, "slug": "perpetual-pinata", "name": "PERPETUAL PINATA", "name_original": "PERPETUAL PINATA", "description": "<p>Perpetual\u00a0Pinata is an Incremental Card Game where you must destroy the pinata. Inside the pinata, is some candy... and another Pinata?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your hand is displayed at the bottom of the screen. There is a mana count near the bottom left. Mana is gained over time. By clicking the Mana button, it toggles the Autoplay feature, which will randomly play cards when the mana is full. Playing cards will damage the Pinata, and the pinata will drop candy.</p>\n<p>The candy can be used to purchase cards from the shop! Generate a set of four cards and pick one that you get to add to your collection. Generating more powerful cards costs more, so get killing on those pinatas.</p>\n<p>Use your collection in order to build your deck.\u00a0 Decks must have 20-30 cards with a limit of 15 copier per card.</p>\n<p>This is the game jam version of the game. It is relatively complete. There's 29 cards and there's a collection and deckbuilding system. I was hoping I could add more cool cards to the game, but I was short on time and found myself having to\u00a0 do a shortcut for a lot of the cards.\u00a0 I also wanted a saving system, but I ran out of time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Potentially working on it, if you really want me to do more, leave a comment/DM me.</p>\n<p>All assets are made for this game by Divagated (except for the font, which was made by\u00a0Divagated, but not for this game)</p>\n<p>Made for ZenoJam</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/zeno-jam-the-perfect-jam-for-beginners-3</p>\n<p>@me in my discord:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/TCyHkAR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c51bb56038255ba1bc806af39d3fdbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Divagated"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
