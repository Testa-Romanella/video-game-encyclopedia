(Granted I probably wouldn't play this very intensely).<br/><br/>When it came to implement it, I gave myself a challenge to make this without using Unity's Physics or Colliders in any capacity. Instead, the goal was to have all objects be aware of:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Their Relative position on the screen ( From the bottom to the top, Left to right, as values between 0.0 and 1.0 respectively)</li><li>Their World Position, which is used for rendering and collision checks</li><li>Their relative size, by virtue of distance + direction checks from multiple offset origins.\u00a0</li><li>Clamped movement, such that at any frame, I could tell you exactly where an entity was, was headed, and where it's going to be. </li></ul>\n<p>Right now it's just Padoru Nero jumping around based on a procedurally generated stage made of blocks, based on the layout of Candies 'n Curses. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/804/8041adeda2025977c459f04a8c7c6dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Digibunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
