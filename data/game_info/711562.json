Santa Claus has been drinking again and started throwing the presents out of his sled instead of placing\u00a0them safely under your tree. Now you need to collect them from your garden so your children can have a wonderful christmas.\u00a0But beware, the local population of badgers are also trying to give their kids a christmas filled with presents,\u00a0so you better be fast. Also, with Santa Claus drinking as much as he does, better check the contents of the\u00a0presents as well before giving your 4yo a chainsaw with a cute ribbon on it.</p>\n<p>Made by<br/>https://i-am-fabii.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16e/16ecb29b102434facc2bb7a6489388a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["I am Fabii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
