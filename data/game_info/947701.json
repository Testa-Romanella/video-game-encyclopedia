There's no alternate ending or choices, and it should be around a 15 minute read through the story.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever made, art and music by me! It's nothing spectacular, and rushed in some aspects, but I hope you enjoy it either way. Have a good day!</p>\n<p>SPECIAL THANKS: boldomeVEVO, SlamTopHatMan, RottyUnwoven, whensrell, 2Mariotic, luckichaiki,\u00a0NiccYeet, and the rest of my friends who cheered me on!</p>\n<p>Like the music?
