It was developed over 3 years and features a chiptune/disco soundtrack by Reed Richards.</p>\n<p>This is the full version of A Mini Falafel Adventure, originally created for a Retro Remakes competition in March 2007. This version is much longer and contains many more bosses and power-ups. An average playthrough will take about 2 hours, so it's not a long game, but the goal of A\u00a0Mini Falafel Adventure is to take you on a journey and surprise you.
