Needless to say, it's in development, and is far from a finished product. Most of the assets have been gathered from image searches and youtube to mp3 converters lol. I'll find a way to create all my own assets if I get serious about this game, but right now, my priority is to make sure everything works. <br/></p>\n<p>Feedback is appreciated, good or bad.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bf/2bff55cbd092524eb39995099d47233a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["duwangJEff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
