Who knows, maybe it can keep moving forever, an infinite amount. But to make sure you and a friend don't have to play forever, you got lives, don't let the ball past your paddle, if it happens too many times then that's game over for you.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>For the left paddle: w for up, s for down</p>\n<p>For the right paddle: up arrow for up, down arrow for down</p>\n\n<p>Extra comment:</p>\n<p>This is a very simple game with no singleplayer or online mode. It's my first game that I'm releasing and was mainly done to understand how to make a game. If you want to check out the inner workings of it here's the github for it:\u00a0https://github.com/PaRK66M/InfiniPong</p>\n<p>I want to be making lots of games which put smiles on people's face so any feedback or advice\u00a0is greatly appreciated. Hope you and whoever you also play with enjoy this game as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90a/90a5d7fe62d66b76bef9249a4deb8741.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PaRK66"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
