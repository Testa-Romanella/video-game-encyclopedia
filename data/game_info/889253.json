I have to admit: I took A LOT of inspiration from Ultrakill, Doom and Devil Daggers, but i hope to make it an original game. If you want sound - turn it on in Escape menu. Music is rather being tested now. I know there are some bugs etc. but i am working hard to fix them. Any feedback would be extremely helpful. If you can, please support the project because I am investing a lot of my personal time in it and trying to get it on steam. Have a good time!</p>\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>WASD: Move<br/>Shift: Dash<br/>Cntrl: Slide<br/>F: Punch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T17:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdc/cdcb73858c2ad03797514748656c04be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["L0g0Z0g0"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
