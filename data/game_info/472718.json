My name is Ian and if you are reading this, thank you so much for giving a little amount of time to play this game, it means a whole lot to me. This was my first game jam and I had alot of fun developing and designing, and learning new things along the way. As a guy with only 3 months of experience developing games, this was my toughest challenge yet, it was very hard and challenging, but the satisfaction you get from finishing the game was unreal!</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any suggestions, and I will try to implement them as much as I can. Anyways, Thank you so much, and for fellow jammers, Goodluck, we all did a great job :&gt;</p>\n<p>-devIan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/964/9649a4df5b728a7a31665485dc48c7e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ianszzkieyyy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
