How about working when you are dreaming, looks like a good idea huh? but! wait... if we can work while dreaming, why don\u2019t we make it a video game. This will be a great experience!!<br/></p>\n<p>The story of the freelancer who uses the \"Work Hard Play Hard\" dreaming machine to learn while she is dreaming. The action RPG game where the player is gonna work during the day and get the knowledge during the night then use that experience to do more harder work.</p>\r\nFeature\r\n<p>In Work Hard Play Hard, you have to finish 16 works within 16 days. But, some work too difficult. So, you has to enter the Work Hard Play Hard Simulation to upgrade your skill. And from now on the game feature\u00a0splits into 2 parts.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nIn the night -\u00a0Get fight in the dream\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>You enter Work Hard Play Hard Simulator. The simulation will bring you into the dungeon full of bug, C# Slime and trap that will shoot ERROR to you and NO place to recover your HP.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And if I can recommend, the best way to face the ERRORs is to research them. Counter the bullet when it gets near you to receive research points that are used to shoot your special bullet and recover your energy.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you finish the dungeon, you will unlock a new level and wake up in the morning.</p>\r\nIn the day -\u00a0Wake up and work\u00a0\r\nDoing Work\r\n\r\n<p>First thing I can recommend you to do on the day is to work once finishing all the work is your objective. In 1 day, you can do up to 2 works before it goes dark. Higher work requires higher energy and level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finishing the work may give you money or skill points or even increase directly to your stat.</p>\r\nBuy upgrade\r\n\r\n<p>The destination of your money. Here in the shop, you can buy items to upgrade yourself or change your play style. And, there are 6 items waiting.</p>\r\nLevel up\r\n\r\n<p>Once you level up, you can go upgrade yourself.</p>\n<ul><li>HP\u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; so you can receive more damage.</li><li>ATK -&gt; for more damage multiplier.</li><li>Energy -&gt; to do more difficult work and increase you energy for attacking.</li></ul>\n<p>In this window, you also can select your tool in the dungeon and an item that you want to carry with.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Notebook shooter : Range attack with small damage but safe.</li><li>Pen lance: Melee attack with skill to summon buddy and higher damage.</li></ul>\r\nControl\r\nWASDWalkSpacebarRollLeft MouseShoot Bullet / SelectRight MouseShoot SpecialECounter / InteractEscPauseQUse HP Orb", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:00:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ae/9aed8ef4acb4ed163cd8cf8ed97ad5ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmberIX"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
