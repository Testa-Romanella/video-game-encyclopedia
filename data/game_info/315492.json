You as the lonely heart is trying to collect three stones. You start with 1000 HP and you have no way to regain them. Between levels you can spend your lives on upgrades, but then you have less hitpoints. The game also has a timer, which allows for speedruns. Post your times in the comments!</p>\n<p>There's a few bugs here and there, but nothing major. We will probably patch these after the jam! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcce04762102c5d08144edb8a63087ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aveuse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
