I made a whole video dedicated to this game jam and the making of this game, coming soon or already out! I couldn't playtest with other people so there maybe many bugs.\u00a0Hope you enjoy this game and make sure to leave some feedback/bug reports in the comments! Made in the Xanderjam Game\u00a0Jam with Godot v3.2.3</p>\r\nContains music \u00a92021 Joshua McLean (https://joshua-mclean.itch.io)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:26:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70fd5ceab8b6caf60ad3a48b0dfe49a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["rystaldev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
