{"id": 707182, "slug": "the-conductor", "name": "The Conductor", "name_original": "The Conductor", "description": "\"Conduct a path for a trebled heart.\"\r\n\n<p>The\u00a0Conductor is a single-player\u00a0Rhythm game where you tap notes that fall down from the top of the screen at the correct time (when they're touching the gears on the bottom of the screen).\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a ball of steam appears on the screen, you must swipe the screen to push the ball of steam offscreen\u00a0(but not on the bottom of the screen because that will trigger the effect).</p>\n\n<p>There are four modes:</p>\n<p>1. Story mode: Play through 3 different levels, having to unlock them by getting a \"good\" or better rating at the end of the level (determined by how accurate you are with your taps). In the first level, you need to get a certain score, in the second level, you need to survive for a certain amount of time, and the third level is the boss level that is very difficult and you need to survive for the entire length of the song and the song is faster than the others and there are attacks that the boss does as well.</p>\n<p>2. Practice mode: Play the game without any worry of losing. It's also endless so you can just keep going without having to continuously restart! However, you won't ever know how accurate you were since the level doesn't ever end.</p>\n<p>3. Endless mode: Like Practice mode, it is also endless, but you will lose after missing 5 notes like normal, so you will be able to know what your score is at the end.</p>\n<p>4. Jukebox mode: Play through any of the songs you want at 60 BPM (meaning one note spawns every second). Like the Boss level, you will play until the end of the song, and not to a certain score or time limit.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the game trailers here:</p>\n\n<p>Credits (in order of last name):</p>\n<p>Team Name:\u00a0Orchestrate</p>\n<p>Game Name: The Conductor</p>\n<p>Project Manager: Holden Elling</p>\n<p>Vision Holder:\u00a0Christian Babcock</p>\n<p>Art Team:\u00a0Jordan Little</p>\n<p>Design Team:\u00a0Alec Nicholson, Mitchel Smith, Jeremy Quickel</p>\n<p>Programming Team: Christian Babcock, Seth Grimes, Amorina Tabera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T19:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ac/4ac972668b69ce51e3de1e6a9a9ca904.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Seth Grimes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
