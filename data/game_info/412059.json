BUT there are\r\nalso some Keyboard controlls but they aren\u2018t quite as smooth as the\r\none with the controllers!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Wallglitcher is a\r\n2-4 player local multiplayer in which you have to surive the longest,\r\njust don\u2018t fall down. You can fight you\u2018re friends if you jump on\r\nthem (yes, in the game too). But the map also fights against you! - I\r\nsometimes just wants you to leave, with an hard impuls, or just\r\nteleports you around. You can also gain some profit from it, if you\r\nuse the ability which is sometimes given to a random Player and just\r\nkick you\u2018r mates out even more.</strong></p>\r\nQuick Awsers to\r\nquestions nobody asked (nFAQ):\r\n<p><strong>1. Which Platforms\r\nare supported?</strong></p>\n<p>Currently only\r\nWindows with 64x and 32x Bit systems.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Are you sure that\r\nthere\u2018s no Linux or Mac release?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, they both\r\nfailed buiding, caused by my incompetense to disable the Xinput from\r\nthe controllers.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Is a Linux build\r\nplanned?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, but I\u2018m a\r\npro-prograstinator.</p>\n<p><strong>4.Which Features\r\ndoes the game have?</strong></p>\n<p>Look below the nFAQ\r\nto see some features!</p>\n<p><strong>5. But will it run\r\nCr\u2026 ehm on my PC?</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty sure it will,\r\nif you have not enough FPS, you can disable PostProcessing in the\r\nsettings, which gave me a performance boost of 300FPS!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6. Are there\r\nany other questions yet?</strong></p>\n<p>No, just ask!</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nPlayer: \r\n<p>We have up to 4\r\nPlayers, which are controlled individually by every controller /\r\nkeyset.</p>\n<p>The Players can walk\r\nto the left and to the right and also double jump.
