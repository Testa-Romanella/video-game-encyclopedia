After the first day I knew my I\u00a0couldn't make the entire game and movement in one day I decided to change plans and came\u00a0up with this concept and got way more done than I thought possible.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Share highscore in the comments:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:41:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8022f2cf50cb35174e12a9776b097f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PepperBoi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
