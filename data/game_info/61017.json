{"id": 61017, "slug": "survisland", "name": "Survisland", "name_original": "Survisland", "description": "  We have designed three different biomes in current version: The Shallows, Mangrove Forest and The Swamp. Each has its own unique landscape, vegetation, resources and sub-biomes. You\u2019ll have to alter your strategy to survive in different biomes.A Living Nature  Sunrise, sunset, changing of clouds and raining, the weather and nature cycling is not only for visual satisfactions. They actually affects you, just like real life surviving, the nature is always the most formidable foe. <br/>The nature has its inner patterns to control the weather; you can learn and use it to benefit yourself. You can stand in shadows or in water to avoid the heat of a summer\u2019s afternoon, start a campfire to keep warm in cold night, detect the direction of the wind from your campfire smoke, hide from strong winds behind a rock, avoiding rain under a tree.<br/>The plants in Survisland also will bear fruits overtime in the right seasons; you can directly pick them up or hit a fruiting tree with a rock to shake some off. Cutting the whole tree down can get all the fruits immediately, but you also will lose a fruit source in long terms.Fully Detailed Metabolism System  We made a very detailed metabolism system to simulate real life human beings.<br/>Your body is built up with muscles, fat, bones, blood and water. All your actions will cost calories, and the stuff you eat can only be useful after you digested them!<br/>  Surviving is not only about keeping hungry and thirsty levels at bay, but to keep nutrition in balance, you\u2019ll have to find various foods to achieve this. Once your body is unbalanced, there will be a symptom as corresponding to it. Some symptoms are harmless, only act as a notification, such like Empty Stomach. Some will reduce your body functions: getting Cold will reduce the stamina regenerate speed and cost more calories. The worst symptoms will reduce your health: Starving, Dehydration, Freeze, Suffocating\u2026 <br/>  Wearing clothes can always provide warmth and also some protections from environment. Some prevents you to get wet when raining; some keep you warm in strong winds. You should wear the suitable gears; eat various foods to keep your stats balanced!Realistic Items  We made a very deep and complex item system: each item has its own size, weight, species, hardness, toughness, quality, portability and functions. These properties determine the size an  item will occupy when you put it into a storage; is the item too heavy for you to carry; how will this item perform in a combat; how can I carry it, with one hand or two; where can I equip this item, as a shirt or belt etc.<br/>  Item system is the heart of our simulation of real life, anything you can think of can be made into an item and you can see it acts in our game with the functions you\u2019d expect in real life!<br/>  Now there are more than fifteen functions we have made in the system, more will added along the way to bring you a more realistic game world.Unique Crafting System  Survisland has a unique crafting system. Some items have one or several Crafting Nodes, it indicates different parts of an item that can be crafted. You\u2019ll need to use various Crafting Techniques to process these parts.<br/>  Which Crafting Techniques you can use is determined by the items on your hands, certain techniques require specific tools in hands.<br/>  This Node Based Crafting system will cover all the common crafting in the field. But you can also find use workbenches to combine items. Workbenches can be found in wild as a wide tree stump or a flat rock.Build Whatever You Want  From a simple leaf tent to a huge stone fortress, you can build anything you want with our flexible Building System.<br/>  You\u2019ll have to craft three types of building marks: Foundation mark, Support mark and Surface mark, to start building. Each mark represents a specific building part and you can upgrade these marks to actual buildings.<br/>  Buildings can protect you from the most violent weather but cost a lot of efforts, choose a fine place to settle down!Up Coming Features Here are some planned mechanics we will add into the game in future updates.<br/><ul><li>More biomes and more resources. We currently only have about one hundred items and three biomes for you to explore and the technology level is still in stone-age. All the fun that metals can give us is coming in future updates. And more biomes will be created as planned: Hills, Rainforest, Mountains, Grassland, etc.</li></ul><ul><li>AI Animals, currently we don\u2019t have animals on the islands, but of course we are going to add them into the game, actually it\u2019s the most prior function we are working right now. There will be fishes, birds and land animals. They will have their own schedule of life and unique reactions to the environment.</li></ul><ul><li>Mental Health, this is another important part of our surviving simulation. Many lone survivors didn\u2019t die from the lack of resources, but mental illness: loneliness, despair, fear. There will be some mental properties added as basic stats, like sadness, excitement, stress or loneliness. New symptoms will also be added to reflect the states of these properties and they can affect the overall mental health, when the mental health is drained out, you may lose your mind and gone crazy.</li></ul>Community:  Survisland should evolve in the way you players prefer to. So we\u2019ll take suggestions and advises from you right here on steam, we\u2019ll open topics focus on certain aspects of the game for you guys to comment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b45/b45f1fb93b614ea567f36a1279a71f1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Super Trampers Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Easy Joy"], "esrb_rating": null}
