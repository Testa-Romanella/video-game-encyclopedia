But, as I meditated, what came up\u00a0was instead a strong sense of hatred I\u2019ve had lodged in me for the abuser of someone I love.</p>\n<p>I decided to meditate through that hatred so I could reconnect with my heart and find something more, uh, positive to bring to this jam. But, as I worked through it, it became clear that that hatred itself was the most honest and present material I could work with this month.\r\n </p>\n<p>So, here it is; a short game about the stages of overcoming hatred for an abuser.\r\n </p>\n<p>HATE is a 1-4 player emotional-surrealist game where players control ragdoll characters to uncover healthy and (sometimes extremely) unhealthy ways to deal with the emotions tied up in hatred. Each level is designed to simulate the emotion it is tied to, and to provide space for players to examine their own relationships with each feeling.</p>\n<p>Level one is anger.\r\n </p>\n<p>Level two is fear.\r\n </p>\n<p>And level three is [protective] love.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c3/0c3aee374943032b8f5c2183c1746919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["faejacks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
