You play as an orphan teenager, and along with your little sister <strong>Kiyoko</strong> and your childhood friend <strong>Mirai</strong>, you will need to break out of your daily routine and join a faction of independent rebels called the <strong>Circle</strong> in order to try to defeat <strong>Everlasting Abundance</strong> (the regime). However, ushering in a new era of freedom isn't as easy as 1-2-3. Conflicts will arise. Tears will be shed. Meat &amp; potatoes will be eaten. And the flowers will grow back... Probably.<br/><br/>This game is 3 to 4 hours long, has 4 different endings and an original soundtrack (heavily influenced by classic JRPG music). It also has a Story Mode if you want to breeze through the combat and mostly experience the narrative.<br/><br/>Pride &amp; Accomplishment!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T05:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca19cd03879f349507b1f2a2f302b19e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExtremeAverage"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ExtremeAverage"], "esrb_rating": null}
