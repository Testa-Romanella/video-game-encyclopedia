What do you do? Smash the shuttlecocks towards the zombies, of course!</p><p>Move your mouse to move the player. Left-click to swing the racket, and right-click to jump. Jump-smashing the shuttlecock will make it spread upon hitting a zombie.</p><p>This is a reupload for a game I made in Ludum Dare #32 (April 17th-20th 2015).
