Your job is to manage the village garden and ensure all households get the produce they need. But be sure to keep the soil healthy. The village has limited space, and if the land degrades, you may not be able to grow enough food.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The community has three garden plots. Each one can support up to three different plant species. All plants have various properties. Make sure to grow the right plants to keep your soil healthy. If any of the plots' health bars reach zero, it is degraded and cannot produce more crops.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: Mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Health bar: Soil Fertility</li></ul>\n<p>Fertile soils help your plants to grow and flourish. Make sure to keep sufficient levels of nutrients and soil organic matter. Be careful, erosion can carry away fertile topsoil, and heavy rain can drain your soil of available nutrients.</p>\n<ul><li>Health bar: Soil Substance</li></ul>\n<p>Many crops need earth to grow, but weather and wind can carry the soil away. Protect against erosion by keeping a shielding plant cover. Deep and established root systems can provide extra protection by stabilizing the soil.</p>\n<ul><li>Health bar: Soil moisture</li></ul>\n<p>Soil moisture is essential for plant growth, but the unprotected ground can dry out quickly. Keep plant cover and shade to slow evaporation. Higher levels of organic matter can also improve the soil's ability to retain moisture.</p>\n<ul><li>Weather Conditions:<ul><li>Moderate:\u00a0A bit of sun, a bit of rain, not too hot, and not too cold. Just perfect!</li><li>Wet: Heavy rain has been pouring down for weeks. It's going to be a wet summer</li><li>Windy: Watch out! Winds are blowing up.</li><li>Dry and Hot:\u00a0The sun is burning. Make sure to stay hydrated.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>[CREDITS]</p>\n<ul><li>Sofia Jonson : Game Design, Subject knowledge \u00a0, Art;</li><li>Helen Gomes: Programming, Game design;</li><li>Music:\u00a0<br/>\r\nZapsplat.com\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f26fee6462235c3a5517b246d6a8a0ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HC_Gomes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
