The theme was \"Running Out of Space.\"\u00a0The basic premise I\u00a0came up with was a dungeon that gets smaller and smaller as you clear your way down. I think the result was something really fun and interesting.</p>\n<p>I'm just stoked that for the first time in several years I've actually finished an LD entry and it was basically exactly what I\u00a0wanted. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>The HTML5 version of the project is a slightly altered port which was completed after the jam time. The only functional difference is that you can press ANY key to get to the controls screen at the start. Otherwise it is functionally identical to the Windows version completed for the Jam. The only other change is the view port size - anything larger causes HUGE framerate drops for some reason and (due to the change in view port size)\u00a0a resizing of the font and text boxes so that they will fit.
