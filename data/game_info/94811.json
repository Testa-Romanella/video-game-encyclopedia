The player has since become a sheep, the objects bales of hay, and so SokoBAArn was born. \u00a0Isometric is perhaps not the best viewpoint for such a game, but I like it, and watching that sheep walking around sure is fun :)</p>\n<p>Two of my previous games - <strong>W*H*B</strong> and <strong>X=Y=Z</strong> - have both featured levels created by other people, and so I thought I'd take that a step further with this game and provide a full-working level editor within the game, which produces a 25-character code which anybody can then type into the game in order to play that level. \u00a0This, along with the 30 levels built into the game, should at least provide a brief distraction to the woes of the world</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65cedc31dd39b78c5265c416ce9b6a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
