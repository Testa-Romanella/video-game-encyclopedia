Press the X button (keyboard X) to start the game.</p>\n<p>The game will begin with Mavis asleep for a short time, she will look like a fuzzy donut when she's asleep. In the sleep state, Mavis' health, happiness, etc. will not diminish.<br/></p>\n<p>When Mavis awakens, she will be ready to be interacted with, there are three modes of interaction you can use the X button (Keyboard X) to use a selected option and the O button (Keyboard Z) to change the selected option.<br/></p>\n<p>PLAY) Represented by a heart icon - using this will bring out a cat teaser toy and Mavis will play with it. Doing this will boost Mavis' happiness meter.<br/></p>\n<p>FEED) Represented by a fish icon - using this will fill up Mavis' food bowl. If you let her food bowl get too low she will become hungry and will have her health diminish.</p>\n<p>CLEAN) Represented by a shovel icon - using this will clean up any poo that Mavis creates. Having poo makes a dirty play environment and will make Mavis' health diminish.</p>\n<p>If you let the health meter drain completely, Mavis will leave you for a much more competent hooman and will leave several poos as a going away present for you. To restart the game once this happens, press the X button or X key on the keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>INTERFACE</strong></p>\n<p>At the top of the screen is the health meter, it is represented by a bar between a broken heart and an intact heart.
