She'd never dared to dream....<br/><br/>\"And...it has local multi-player, with competitive tournament action? How many players?\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"At least 6. More if you can figure out how to plug them all in. XBOX, PS4, Wiimotes. Everything I could find.\"<br/><br/>Electrostatic energy crackled between us as I explained that it was a party game. Players control heads that fly around like rockets, competing to collect falling points and collaborating to keep the heart from being eaten. Her jaw trembled when I told her it offered intense, physics based action, where your best defense was to excrete blocks on all those beneath you.<br/><br/>She was silent, but I knew her thoughts rushed like the hot blood in our veins.<br/><br/>\"I.....I love you\" she whispered.
