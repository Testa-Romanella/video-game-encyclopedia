I hope I have done the genre justice with SALVAGE and that you will play through several times, enjoying the new and exciting experience each play-through provides.<br/><br/>I see SALVAGE's replayability as key to its value proposition, and I hope you will agree.<br/><br/>I hope you will check back frequently\u2014here on the store page, or on SALVAGE's Discussions forums\u2014for progress updates and news. Please also feel free to follow me on Facebook and Twitter.<br/><br/>If you want to contribute more actively to SALVAGE's development, I will be haunting the Discussion forums as much as possible to gather your ideas, feedback and suggestions, and to answer your questions as best I can.<h3>What can I expect during Early Access?</h3><ul><li>I WILL UPDATE THE GAME FREQUENTLY\u2014And if I need to take a break longer than a week, I will inform you via a Steam announcement.<br/></li><li>I WILL COMMUNICATE\u2014I genuinely love games and gaming in all its forms.
