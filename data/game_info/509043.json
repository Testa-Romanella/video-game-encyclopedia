Leave orbit, enter the atmophere and gracefully glide to your landing spot. Economize your fuel, avoid overheating and do NOT stall your wing. Gravitation, heating, air resistance, lift, pressure and more are modelled in accordance with physical reality.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created in 10 days for the Beginner Circle Jam #3. It uses no engine but SDL for input/output and portaudio plus libpd for sound output. If you have an older machine, please make sure to reduce the resolution. This is because the world is procedurally generated and rendered on CPU.</p>\n<p>Who we are:<br/>Graphic Design: Hermann \"optimaList\" Seitz<br/>Programming and Sound: Julian \"DaJu\" Wenzel</p>\n<p>special thanks to Nina and Toni for testing the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/160/1603fd111aa0d830a7f3622b1f8d2d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaJu", "optimaList"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
