It seems you've got a few days to meet some new friends before everything starts up again. Lucky for you, there's a popular park nearby! In this cute, short little not-a-dating-sim (It's a friend making sim!) you can talk with a handful of fuzzy creatures and get to know them!</p>\n<p>This was created for GBJAM-9 as mostly an exercise for me to force myself to complete something with a deadline, as well as to identify areas I need to improve in. I've learned a ton from this and look forward to trying again in another jam!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my entry! I'm pretty sure I've checked every path and they should all be functional, but if I missed something please let me know!<br/></p>\n<p>A Button = Z<br/>D-Pad = Arrow Keys<br/></p>\n<p>(That's all you need to play!)</p>\r\nThings I'm proud of:\r\n<p>- The art! I think I did a pretty good job of creating a few cute friends!<br/>- Completing this! I need to get better at scheduling.</p>\r\nThings that were okay:\r\n<p>- The script is fine, I wish I had written more.</p>\n<p>- The engine not displaying ' properly? I could have fixed this, but didn't.<br/>- The gameplay loop. It exists but isn't the best. I could have added more for the player to do.</p>\r\nThings I've learned:\r\n<p>- I can't write music! Holy cow is it hard!<br/>-\u00a0I miss my IDE, drag and drop can get tiring fast.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fa/6fa39eb23201876977e9ef2835096535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Syber"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
