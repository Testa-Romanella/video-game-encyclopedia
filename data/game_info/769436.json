The design of the game scene is based on the underworld division in ancient Chinese myths and legends. But only this time, we broke the stereotypical impression. Presented to the players is the rich experience of box court exploration, interesting game interactions, and immersive plot scenes. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>Koward is a timid guy who doesn't dare reveal his feeling to his girlfriend Mangostina. In order to complete the indicators given by the king of hell Yama, the two hell messengers Black Wuchang and White Wuchang (Wuchang means impermanence in Chinese language) abducted Koward with an excuse and brought him to the underworld. Koward's spirit was then imprisoned within Fengdu Ghost City. To escape and resurrect, Koward needs to collect enough elements and meet all the necessary conditions. As Koward, the player will explore the netherworld and vibe with some ghosts and monsters and cheat the death Yama with fantastic tricks.<br/><br/><strong>Key features</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Novel interactive system</li></ul>The hero needs to constantly collect wine to fill the 'wine spring' so as to prevent the devastating moment after the king of hell wakes up. In addition, the hero can get stuff from his relatives and friends in the mortal world by dream messaging and the cross-world delivery services. The psychic medium undertaking this operation is borne by the famed Bank of Heaven and Earth.<br/><br/><ul><li>Classic but not exhausting box court exploration</li></ul>There are always some collection elements on the bright side. Still, with your desire for more of them, you will find that you are good at discovering those hidden elements in quirky corners and obtaining the sense of achievement in a professional manner. Pay attention to those luminous, missing and regularly arranged places! And do revisit the places you have been to for new discoveries! There are little ghosts who like to whine and cry! You will need to constantly adjust the lens angle flexibly while playing the game to find hidden elements.<br/><br/><ul><li>There is a casino in the underworld! Compete against ghosts with fantastic leisure games</li></ul>After thousands of years of ghostly work, White Impermanence, a righteous ghost officer, nowadays patronises the Oblivion Casino because of boredom. Believe it or not, chips of the  casino in the underworld can be souls if only you dare!<br/><br/><ul><li>More gameplays under development</li></ul>Join the hell disco, check out the dungeons and mazes, and meet the most powerful being in the underworld - the Great Emperor of Fengdu! <br/><br/><strong>Operating instructions</strong><br/>In the process of the game exploration, you will often use the [Q][E][R][F] key to adjust the lens angle, use the [K] key to reset the lens, use [C][V] to zoom in and out, and use \u3010B\u3011to switch the first and third person.
