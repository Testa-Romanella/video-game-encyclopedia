Stunts are only awarded if you land properly, to practice you landings!<br/><br/><strong>Exploding cars</strong><br/>Cars now have a Damage Meter. If it gets to 100%... KA-BOOM! You explode... then re-spawn in a random location. And.. when you explode, your car breaks into bits that stay in the level, so you can drive into them and push them around. It's insanely fun.. so on, try it out!<br/><br/><strong>ELEVEN Unique Cars</strong><br/>You can select any of the ELEVEN amazing stunt cars each with differing suspension, weight and handling. Any car can be played in any level in any game mode from an easy to navigate game selection menu (once you have unlocked them).<br/><br/><strong>ELEVEN Amazing Levels</strong><br/>Choose from ELEVEN unique driving environments, filled with stunt and trick ramps, bonuses and hidden challenges including an awesome Power-Ups that will allow you to take your tricks to a whole new level!<br/><br/><strong>Collect COINS to unlock content</strong><br/>Each level in Go Crazy game mode contains 1x Game mode coin, 1x Level coin (in 3 pieces) and 1x Car coin (in 3 pieces).
