Dinner is served in the underwater corpse-city at the Caf\u00e9 R'lyeh. Meet a Deep One for the first time and get to know each other while enjoying the nightmare cornucopia of delicacies and share fun anecdotes while you look for love and try not to go insane.<br/><br/>Gameplay unfolds over a dinner conversation, where the choices you make have consequences to the love connection with your date, and also to your sanity. If you have a keen eye for detail, you will pick up on the subtle clues that your date has mentioned. This will help you explore additional areas of conversation that can lead to a lasting love, and help avoid the date spiraling down into inescapable madness!<br/><br/>Each new date is a chance to find love or madness with another creature - each one has a randomized personality profile that is generated each time you play, and the menu items also change with the tides of chaos, so no two dates are ever the same!<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Intriguing characters with individual personalities that react to your choices<br/></li><li> Subtle and slowly maddening layers of puzzling depth in your date's behavior<br/></li><li> Unique and original horror-painting art style<br/></li><li> Love and Sanity meters that increase and decrease depending on how your date is going<br/></li><li> Deep-dish horror cuisine, featuring things that should not be for breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner</li></ul><br/>We hope you enjoy your stay near scenic Innsmouth under the sea.
