The game has multiple endings though, in case you want to explore better.<br/><br/>I developed this game in 2012, initially in a custom engine, currently I ported it to Unity, so that I can provide Windows, Linux and OSX builds.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c4c52736a412cf95fe5e7b977fbd86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lunar Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
