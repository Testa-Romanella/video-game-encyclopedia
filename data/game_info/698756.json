I had never made a game before making KSK.... So yes at the time it got a lot of hate...</p>\n<p>KSK2 However has proved to be somewhat of a special launch since .. I already had tons of previous experience with the engine .... and Its launch wasnt so bad...</p>\n<p>I am recovering KSK2 because I believe this game had potential... I mean It definetly doesnt have same quality of my most modern GAMES.... but well it still proven to break a lot of barriers for me...</p>\n<p>KSK2 introduces fishing mechanic as well as crafting.... and as always in this game you will be fighting the same battles over and over again hiting \"Enter\" lots of times...</p>\n<p>while unlocking new content and progress...</p>\n<p>KSK2 is a game that made me really proud at the time...</p>\n<p>KSK however I no longer have the files of that game... You can still play KSK2 since you dont need to know anything of the first game in order to play the second game...</p>\n\n<ul><li>Active Battle system(\"Enter\" spamming)</li><li>Incremental progression</li><li>Crafting</li><li>Shoping</li><li>Cute Recipes</li><li>Funny non important lore =)</li></ul>\n<p>Have Fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:06:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/382/382faa04d67628dc59108ef81da78f36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixelabor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
