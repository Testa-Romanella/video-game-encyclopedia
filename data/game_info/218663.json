He must tackle many arduous tasks. He must make many painful choices. He must take on terrible creatures. But his burning determination will overcome the Plague and his worst nightmares.<br/><br/>==================================<br/>- Dubbing in english, latin and italian<br/>- Original character and story (really a bad guy...)<br/>- Rich 3D audio environments (best in home theatre 5.1)<br/>- From 6 to 8 hours of gameplay<br/>- Beautiful and well-acted dialogues<br/>- More than 21.000 words dubbed for every language!<br/><br/>==================================<br/>We apologise in advance for having to keep the price so high, but unfortunately we had to dub loads more text (including that where the lead character describes the locations he\u2019s in) and having worked really hard to ensure playability for all, with long, complex testing phases and loads of effort in all, the production phase was much costlier than expected. But we strongly believe that many video games can and must be made accessible to the blind and the sight impaired, and so we decided to take this risk. This is our passion and our mission, and we feel that this kind of game (i.e. adventure games) is PERFECT for playing in audiogame mode. So please understand the reason why we had to set this price, and help us when you can to spread the word about this adventure, in all senses, that we have embarked on together. Thanks for your understanding, and thanks again to all those who decide to purchase the game.<br/>We fully intend to continue along this road and produce other games. If we succeed in selling enough copies to break even we will have the economic sustainability to continue to produce videogames that are truly accessible to all. And not only Medieval or adventure games!<br/><br/>Yours for eternity,<br/>Ivan Venturi (creator, script writer, designer and producer of the Inquisitor project)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a4d1a70ca5f7d7cd973ed090a6dddf_WuPvCnQ.jpg", "website": "http://www.audiogamestore.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ASSOCIAZIONE CULTURALE DI PROMOZIONE SOCIALE AUDIOGAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["ASSOCIAZIONE CULTURALE DI PROMOZIONE SOCIALE AUDIOGAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
