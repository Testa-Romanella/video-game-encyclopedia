As you grow, you constantly evolve and get ever better weapons. In the end, you\u2019ll have to face the ultimate adversary and defeat it to win the game.<br />\nThis game has been in development for a long time and I\u2019m proud to finally release it! It has FAR more content than the first game- 26 unique tank states, over 30 weapons, and over 50 enemy types! Hundreds of comments on the first game have been considered in the development of this better version!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a3e/a3e5fb289586931e91f6fc10d9c0e30d.png", "website": "https://www.kongregate.com/games/HeroInteractive/bubble-tanks-2", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
