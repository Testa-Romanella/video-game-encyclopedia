Failing to escape them will result in your untimely demise. Do you have what it takes to escape the machine learning hummingbirds?!</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>This is the second prototype game I developed\u00a0for EECS 499 at the University of Michigan as a research project. The research project was interested in exploring the\u00a0application of machine learning in game development. As such, I\u00a0tried to create a playable game centered around machine learning agents. This prototype game is the end result of what I was able to accomplish in little under a semester's worth of research and development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out the full project devlog:\u00a0https://projecttalos.com/</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\nMusic\r\n<ul><li>Darren Curtis - Demented Nightmare</li><li>Rachel F.
