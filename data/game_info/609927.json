You now have 30 seconds to destroy as many asteroids as possible! Smaller asteroids farther away from you are worth more points than bigger ones closer to you. If you get a high score, it is saved permanently unless you decide to reset your high score at the start of each 30 second round. If you lose your guns by dropping them or throwing them out of reach like a drunk baboon, no worries as there is a reset guns button on your terminal to get you out of the mess you made!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52c3949183508cf913204175e98d3168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wizardsmana"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
