You will need keycards to reach him. There are 3 stops with the starting area included.<br/>The difficulty is more unforgiving than in the original. Save games are not supported. If you find the game hard, there are cheats included in the readme.</p>\n<p>More information is in the readme file.</p>\n\n<p>My first Unity game has the same name as this project, that was more multiplayer focused and used the game's 8 bit textures.</p>\n<p>This version focuses on single player and HQ textures, models.<br/>I began working on this in 2013 and finished it in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong><br/>The levels were converted with a Build engine tool, only the subway map was made from scratch.<br/>Some sounds and video were used from the TekWar TV series.<br/>Ped models and animations were used from GTA: SA that were more or less altered.<br/>Textures were mostly from <strong>textures.com</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to:</strong><br/>Sleepy for testing and feedback during the development. He also made the vehicle and a big hand statue 3D model.</p>\n<p>Minimum system requirements:</p>\n<p>- Windows XP SP2 or newer<br/>- .Net Framework 2.0<br/>- 512 MB RAM<br/>- 2.0 Ghz CPU<br/>- Nvidia 9500 GT<br/>- 500 MB free space<br/>- 200 MB after install</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong><br/>https://github.com/kurtis2222/TekwarRemake<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/889bbd26614d6e7398ce26e82ea0b583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kurtis2222"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
