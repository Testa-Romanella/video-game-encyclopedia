A perpetual blight, swallowing and corrupting all in its path; mutated creatures and grotesque monsters now roam the lands of old.\r\n</p>\n<p>Much of the populace attempted to flee to the surrounding kingdoms, however, under the King\u2019s orders, no one was to leave.\r\n</p>\n<p>Foreign invaders saw this as an opportunity; one where ignorance led to death. Now with a confused, hungry, and ever desperate population, the Kingdom of Whaebrook teeters on the brink of collapse.\r\n</p>\n<p>Many heard tales regarding a group of legendary heroes that went missing sometime before the madness that ensued, maybe it could be linked?\r\n</p>\n\n<p>However, not all is doom and gloom. Outsiders flock to Whaebrook in the hopes they can make a name for themselves, become a hero, and fight back against evil.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as Arryn, the Forgotten Knight, a character from humble beginnings. He was once a poor farm boy who worked on his grandparent's farm, living day to day, barely getting by. Woodland thieves raided his village and abducted him to replenish their fallen. Later in life, he wished to make an honest living. He rose through the ranks, ultimately settling as the Queen's guard. After her death, Grimwald banished him out of sheer disdain. Arryn goes on a pilgrimage to retrieve an ancient artifact of immense power and value, but to what avail?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T21:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9ac2585f95a3e772b705ffb97b63ea73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sokcx", "Zaiier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
