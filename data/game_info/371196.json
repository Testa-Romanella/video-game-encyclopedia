Think and make your way out of each level with a simple cube.</p><p>Any questions or just wanna hang out? Join my Discord, click\u00a0here!</p>\n<p>My first game ever! I never made game, only thing I could do before this was moving objects using a tutorial, and now I learned so much. This game isn't meant to be a winner, good looking or extremely nice to play. I just wanted to learn new things, and that's what I did. Now I can start making a real game with cool game-play and art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667dbfd6bf484f6c0fb8f8798f491fd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrizlyBear"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
