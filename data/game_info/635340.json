This game has more horror plots than many similar works. Even if I debug the game step by step from the perspective of developers, I will still feel horrified. Since the process of game ontology is not too long for the first time, I added a link with higher playability to the part after the game was cleared. This is definitely a horror game worth playing. I hope all players will like it.( I u I )<br/>\r\nAfter purchasing this game, you will receive:<br/>\r\n1. About 30 minutes of intense and exciting adventure in horror villa<br/>\r\n2.
