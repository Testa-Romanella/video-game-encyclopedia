The story of a world plagued by a virus, that has killed all adult males, leaving only women, and young males alive. However they are not alone, for zombies stalk the streets seeking to turn them into zombies. You take the role of a young boy, who is building a shelter so his mother and sister can survive the zombies that now plague the city. On your travels, you will meet other NPCs, who you can invite to your shelter and help protect. However the clock is constantly ticking, and you need to make sure you keep a good stock of food, medicine, and other supplies. But be careful more zombies come out at night! You can send people at your shelter out to do quests, but the young male zombies are known to infect women in a very special way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T12:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658980e161ff7a6ffa028e9dfa731f34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["justcoffe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
