Place down and move around a variety of chess pieces to defend a magical barrier against an army of robots, collectively known as the COVET.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Progress</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>There are 3 different chess pieces (pawn, rook and king) to move around the board.</li><li>There is only 1 type of COVET, moving in a straight line.</li><li>There is an in-game tutorial to cover the basic mechanics. This tutorial can be skipped.</li><li>The only proper \"level\" after the tutorial is endless, measured in waves. The amount and spawn rate of the COVET gradually increases up to the 100th wave.</li><li>The game is only localized in English. I think that should go without saying when development has only lasted a couple weeks, but still.</li><li>Every art asset in the game is subject to change.\u00a0I'm a programmer, not so much an artist.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T08:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e856ca123a69cc72d387f48584b7fb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gavitro"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
