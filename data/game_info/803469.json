The answers will eventually point them in a very specific direction. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Well, this is it! The finale of the so-called Matsumori series! However, I'm aiming to make this game more stand-alone than the other titles. I might look into having some kind of in-game encyclopedia to help smooth things out on this front.</p>\n<p>This game doesn't really have as much of an involved story behind it's creation as <em>Matsumori Days</em> or <em>Arbiters From Another World</em>, sadly. Actually, to be honest, I'm thinking that making this incarnation of the game will <strong>be</strong> this game's \"involved story\"!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T15:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f1983cc3565a99f0fb86b771481ed019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarrendReikan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
