Laser doors have malfunctioned and there are electric shocks occurring everywhere.

The same concept is introduced in the game and it matches the theme perfectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>\"Smoky Splash\" is a partial grid-based and partial rogue-like\u00a0game where the main goal of the game is to secure the 3 chemicals that has been mixed to form smoke in the lab. But be careful, the lasers have malfunctioned and there are electric shocks occurring everywhere. As soon as you secure all 3 chemicals the smoke will gradually reduce and clear on its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The controls are super simple.<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</li></ul><ul><li>Enter or Space to start</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Concept, Design &amp; Programming<ul><li>Anagh's World - using Godot 3.2.3</li></ul></li><li>Graphics<ul><li>Anagh's World &amp; Kenney (www.kenney.nl)</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Anagh's World, Kenney (www.kenney.nl) &amp; CodeManu@opengameart.org</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dev Comments</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The movement of the player is non-grid based and it is done purposely to introduce some difficulty in the gameplay.</li><li>When you run away from an electric shock or laser, instead of you getting electrocuted, you are pushed away from it. This gives a realistic effect and also makes the gameplay little easy around the dangers.</li><li>You might feel that the levels are little blurry or whitish, that is because of the smoke in the room.</li><li>The game has only 3 levels since I had to make the game in just 3 hours and I was out of time. On the brighter side,\u00a0 now small kids can also complete the game easily :)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T09:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3c40e8f867a8feaa9653df6154ae97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anagh's World"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
