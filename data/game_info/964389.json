Play the default game modes, create custom game modes, and view your stats in-game and on the BeatShot website.<br/><br/>A BeatShot account is automatically created for you using your Steam ID when you first launch the game. You can sign in through Steam on the website to view your scores anywhere.<h3>How does the audio analyzer work?</h3>The analyzer keeps a rolling average of the frequency values across multiple channels. When it detects a change in frequency that is very different from the current rolling average, targets are spawned. You can change how sensitive the analyzer is to frequency changes for each channel using the settings menu.<br/><br/><br/>When you provide the game with a song file, it analyzes a separate audio track from the one you actually hear. This offset allows the game to account for reaction time. Here's a short breakdown, using 250 milliseconds for reaction time:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The idea is to destroy the target at the bright green color. Reaction time is one of the settings changed across difficulties in default game modes, but can customized using the Spawn Beat Delay setting in custom modes.<h3>Default Game Modes</h3><br/>Default game modes are meant to provide baseline functionality and show what custom settings are used to make them.<br/><br/><ul><li> Multi-Beat: continuously spawn targets<br/></li><li> Single-Beat: only one at a time<br/></li><li> Beat-Track: tracking one target<br/></li><li> Beat-Grid: static grid of activating targets<br/></li><li> Cluster-Beat: multiple targets spawn at once, each activated separately<br/></li><li> Charged Beat-Track: Multiple moving targets that require 2+ shots to destroy</li></ul><h3>Custom Game Modes</h3><br/>Customize your own game mode from scratch, a default mode template, or a previously created custom mode. There are currently 40+ customizable settings, including:<br/><br/><ul><li> Spawn area height/width, including dynamic spawn area height/width<br/></li><li> Minimum and maximum size of targets, including dynamic target sizing<br/></li><li> Spawn beat delay<br/></li><li> Max target lifespan<br/></li><li> Target spawn cooldown<br/></li><li> Multiple target movement settings<br/></li><li> Minimum distance between targets<br/></li><li> Target activation conditions<br/></li><li> Target deactivation conditions<br/></li><li> Target destruction conditions<br/></li><li> And a lot more</li></ul><h3>Detailed Scoring Analysis</h3>As of now (July 17th), the stats page on the website contains:<br/><ul><li> Overview, showing time played statistics across all modes and play frequency over the past year<br/></li><li> Default Modes, allowing you to select a game mode, song, and difficulty (see gif below)<br/></li><li> Custom, allowing you to select a custom game mode and song<br/></li><li> History, showing every score entry you've ever saved</li></ul><h3>Audio Analyzer Settings</h3><ul><li> Up to 24 user defined frequency band channels (e.g. 0-87 Hz for a bass channel)<br/></li><li> threshold (sensitivity) for each band channel<br/></li><li> time window of the frequency sample</li></ul><h3>Other Settings</h3><ul><li> Custom crosshair creator<br/></li><li> Change all colors that a target cycles through<br/></li><li> Standard video/audio settings, including DLSS 3<br/></li><li> Sensitivity based on two common competitive FPS games</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T04:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b74c55a815b5cd1649121cb04ee47bf.jpg", "website": "https://beatshot.gg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Markoleptic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Markoleptic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
