The race that happens only once a century. It started in 1938 when Sir Rodger Clark wanted the greatest race. Not just a normal race, but a race that was unbeatable! He started by making people dress up from different eras to race and see who would win. But that got boring. Forward 2000 years later, his great great great great great great great (this goes on for a while) relative, revised this race but using their state of the art (sometimes breaks) Time Condenser Unit (TCU) to travel around actual time and find racers from the ages. Pick your racer, travel around the track in the era but watch out, the TCU is prone to randomly opening rifts that you will be pulled into! <br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You will spawn with an intro cutscene showing you around a map. You will then be taken to the character selection where you can pick your racer. Simply pick ,race and enjoy! You can quit on the results screen or ALT+F4.\u00a0 Cars will also adapt to being in the sea and land so keep an eye out! <br/></p>\n<p>Two awesome maps with one being in the Viking era with Loki and Valkyrie and one being from the Medieval era with Ralph the shop keep! (Yeah...Ralph was an odd one. We were looking for racing candidates and well Vikings are obvious, but Ralph..he was persistent. Turns out fans love him!) <br/></p>\r\nDeveloper Comments\r\n<p>I had an absolute blast making this game. So much fun to make everything work and play nicely together. I didn't create the models but I used assets I had purchased. Still as so much fun. I played the game several times and just had a blast. I had more plans for the game but just like every jam, you never manage to get them all in.\u00a0I\u00a0used\u00a0so\u00a0many\u00a0packs over the years I've brought\u00a0from\u00a0the Unity Asset\u00a0Store, HumbleBundle and SyntyStudios. <br/></p>\n<p> I streamed making large portions which you can find here:<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n What I did well\r\n<ul><li>The use of HDRP to make a visually appealing game with\u00a0volumes\u00a0and\u00a0lights \r\n</li><li>The game play is quite fun. \r\n</li><li>The story behind the race is funky and unique</li><li>I streamed a huge chunk of development</li><li>The kit bashing of models to make cars</li></ul>\r\nWhat I would do better next time\r\n<ul><li>Don't focus on making sections \"perfect\" and just get the gameplay out</li><li>Find a way to make some Unity packages accept asmdef files. It kinda makes it super hard to work when I use them and they don't.</li><li>Need powerups! Need to lay the game out more before fine tuning.</li><li>The cars sound too much like normal cars lol Need to learn FMOD more</li></ul>\r\nNew things I've learnt\r\n<ul><li>Cinemachine Dolly and Cart - There are some features missing (like being able to play it in the editor) but overall its a quick way to provide a nice dolly system</li><li>Ultimate Vehicle Controller - This asset is a brilliant start for any car racing system. It has a good AI with a decent car driving system.</li><li>FMOD - Fmod is a tool for managing audio easier than mixing directly in Unity. Still have so much to learn here!</li></ul>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<ul><li>Some vehicles float</li><li>Ralph isn't the greatest character for some odd reason lol</li><li>AI sometimes fall through the floor</li><li>You can manually change gears in the car which breaks it a little</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cff44251dd56fba5c6492694bb908aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["D3kryption"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
