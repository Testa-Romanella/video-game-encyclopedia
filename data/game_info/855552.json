Rack up as many laps as you can before time runs out! Use arrow keys to move, 'X' to start or reset.<br/><br/>This is my entry to the 2022 #pico1k jam, run by @Liquidream! This jam challenges entrants to produce a game in PICO-8 using only 1024 compressed bytes of code.<br/></p>\n<p>For the sake of posterity and reflection, here are some of the things I did to squeeze this into the size limit:</p>\n<ul><li>Used a goto based program structure, rather than function based. This allowed me to use some routines which 'fall through', removing the need for multiple function calls.</li><li>During the maze transition animations, instead of making a function to erase only the map tiles (to avoid drawing over the stars in the background), I instead just made the stars last in the draw queue, and made them only draw if they aren't drawing on any existing graphics.</li><li>Grouped some routines together in a counter-intuitive, but space efficient way. For instance, the if statement that is used to draw end-of-game text also contains the routines for handling end-of-game input.</li><li>Generated maps directly in the map memory using the binary-tree maze-building algorithm. Wrote that routine so it can produce maps with the opposite bias using the same code.</li></ul>\n<p>This was a real challenge, and I learned a bunch of new stuff from this jam! I hope you enjoy this little Marble-Madness-inspired racer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e4a891306787172550020319f0f1c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Soundole"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
