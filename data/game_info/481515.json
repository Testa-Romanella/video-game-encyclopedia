Each tablet has a magic power associated with the letter that is released when used as an attack. For example, the letter \"C\" releases a chilling blast that freezes enemies. You can even release multiple tablets at one time, to power up the main attack.</p>\n<p>When you release the power of a letter in an attack, you have to input the braille character associated with that letter. If you're successful, the attack will be even more powerful!<br/></p>\n<p>All the letters released in an attack this way are added to the \"Chain\", a list of letters that are floating in space. When you smash letters together, they might form words. And when that happens, the Chain releases a powerful attack against your enemies! Try to build words with your Braille attacks along with normal attacks to maximize strategy, but watch out for your opponents manipulating the Chain too!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Blind Accessibility<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The Sequence was built with blind accessibility in mind from the ground up. Even though it has impressive visuals, it also has a high level of accessibility for blind and visually impaired users, allowing for free 2D movement, detailed menus and descriptions. Features include wall and hallway detection, labeling landmarks, step sounds, visual descriptions, and full keyboard compatibility.</p>\n<p>Note: The current release has a Text-To-Speech lag bug that is top priority. Expect a patch within the next week.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n<p>The main game code for The Sequence is not open source, however, several parts that were used to build it are.</p>\n<p>Speech-DLL - The DLL that allows Game Maker to talk to SAPI. NVDA support is planned in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>Game Stat Builder - A dev tool to help produce data files for the game. Please note that this application is not blind accessible, but it might be added in the future. :(</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>\n<p>Join us on discord!<br/></p>\n<p>Support me on Patreon!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d40b342bbd46f6ca4341a5a50a03801.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punished Felix"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
