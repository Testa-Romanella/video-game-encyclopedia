There are two files in the archive: sbm2_1.1.tap, and sbm2_1.1.trd.</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow this game came to be\r\n<p>In the far 2001, a Marie Slip\u2019s port of the world famous game \u201cSuper Bomberman 2\u201d was released on ZX Spectrum. More than 20 years passed since then, and the same author, but now with a team of professionals, decided to rebuild the game, creating it from scratch.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are waited by hi-quality engine, brand new graphics and music, new prizes, new worlds, new enemies and at the end it is necessary to fight with a boss. The game also has its own uncomplicated story that immerses you in this fun universe. The game\u2019s engine guarantees smooth 50 fps movement and animation, plenty of sound effects and music to AY-8910 from a professional musician, as well as General Sound support.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n\r\nRelease notice\r\n<p>The full version of the game is sufficiently optimized and accelerated to support slow memory computers like classic ZX Spectrum 128.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you going to play with friend (2 player mode) on HARD level of the game, you may be need to use 7 MHz turbo mode (if exists on your hardware). It\u2019s because sprites may flick on 3.5 Mhz.\r\n</p>\n<p>When playing VS BATLE the accumulated prizes does not disappear after death. This makes the game a bit more interesting.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls are set by default:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1: OPQA, SPACE, ENTER (pause)\r\n</li><li>Player 2: Sinclair 1\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Before you start the game, you may want to set the buttons for both players in the Options menu, and select play using the Kempston Joystick.\r\n</p>\n<p>During play, you can switch the music off/on and exit to the main menu using the ENTER button.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game autodetects Kempston Joystick, so when it\u2019s present it will automatically activated by default.\r\n</p>\n\n<ol><li>Fire \u2013 increases the blast radius (maximum effect can be obtained by taking 5 pieces).\r\n</li><li>Bomb \u2013 extra bomb (maximum effect if 5 are taken).\r\n</li><li>Bomb-kicking foot \u2013 with this thing you can kick bombs.\r\n</li><li>Yellow heel \u2013 allows you to pass through bombs.\r\n</li><li>Heart \u2013 gives you an extra life.\r\n</li><li>Green Blob \u2013 allows you to place yellow bombs, which can explode from contact with walls, if you kick them well, of course.\r\n</li><li>Red Shield \u2013 gives you invulnerability to explosions.\r\n</li><li>Fuse bomb \u2013 while standing on the bomb, hold down the \u201cFire\u201d button and the bomb will activate standby mode. As soon as you release \u201cFire\u201d, a detonation will occur. This allows you to kill enemies while waiting for them to approach.\r\n</li><li>White Skull \u2013 can take away all your bonuses, or force you to place bombs for 20 seconds without respite. A bad prize, but trust me, in the heat of battle you\u2019ll often take it by mistake.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Version 1.1</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>More than 10 rare bugs fixed (thanks to the community for their help in finding them!).\r\n</li><li>The demo version has become a full-fledged gaming demo that has an end and a beginning. The demo version includes the first 5 levels and the casino.\r\n</li><li>Have you been annoyed by flickering sprites? The game engine has been accelerated so that sprites no longer flicker on computers with slow memory.\r\n</li><li>The entire engine has been redesigned, with the hit boxes now using pixel-precision technique, which means the game now more enjoyable to play.\r\n</li><li>Added the ability to choose a character when playing as a single person (yeah, you may roleplay a girl even when playing solo!).\r\n</li><li>Fixed bugs with weapons, casino, and game freezes.\r\n</li><li>When playing in HARD mode, the balance has been corrected. The \u201cShield\u201d prize works for one level, then is taken away. This way you can\u2019t just bomb everything.\r\n</li><li>Well and still the game runs fine at 50 fps.\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nThe authors\r\n<p><strong>Code</strong>: Marie Slip, Gogin<br/><strong>Music</strong>: n1k-o<br/><strong>Graphics</strong>: Joe Vondayl<br/><strong>Testing</strong>: Black Cat, Alex\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T09:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b26fc39a19ee1bfe13efb77bace26b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZXEvolution"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
