How unfortunate that this particular forest was also the lair of a bunch of famished monsters... It would be a real shame if a bewitched and malicious Sign transform itself to trick and mislead the hikers ! ! Guide the hikers to the three different paths to feed the monsters, and be careful to not let the monsters starve nor stuff them ! Beware, every type hiker has its own nutritional intake and more or less fill the hunger-gauges !</em></p>\n<p>We used free assets for the font and the SFX:</p>\n<p>Kenney<br/>- Menu select sound<br/>SuperPowers asset pack<br/>- Creature sounds<br/>Speedenza<br/>- Whoosh sound on sign metamorphosis<br/>Godowan<br/>- Exclamation point appear sound<br/>Geronimo Font Studios<br/>- Kindergarten font for in game text and menu<br/>Iconian Fonts<br/>- Young frankentein font used for menu assets</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T04:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c2efc4ef76278cf55632963d28f2a7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scarounet", "Yawl", "Sollen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
