Momentum is conserved but gravity is reversed, letting you fling yourself high into the air or deep beneath the surface. The goal is always straightforward - collect the three orbs in the level and jump into the wormhole - but spikes, endless drops and impossible heights make this more and more difficult.Key Features<br />\nDive into the ground - This unique mechanic preserves your momentum, letting you use the level itself to overcome a huge range of challenges.<br />\nConquer over 150 levels - Run, jump and dive your way through levels spanning from easy to brutally difficult. You&#39;ll need to both master the controls as well as think outside the box.<br />\nNon-linear level unlock system - Explore the game in whatever order best suits you.<br />\nAchieve Time Goals - Three tiers of medals provide an additional challenge for even the easiest levels.<br />\nMinimalistic graphics - Straight-to-the-point graphics help you focus on the gameplay.<br />\nMusic by Dubmood - A killer track that grows as you progress.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2014-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-18T07:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/827359772c54be643cfbc3d29b4e7f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 190, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Digerati Distribution", "Daniel Linssen"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digerati Distribution", "Kot in Action Creative Artel"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
