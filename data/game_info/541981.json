It was released in response\u00a0to the very well received film `Two small town`. It even caused a shortage of coins in the cities where it was released into the arcades.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this game was thought to be lost to corporate greed over licensing issues.\u00a0The film company chose to destroy all copies of the game along with all source to prevent any\u00a0lawsuits. As such this game was thought lost.</p>\n<p>The source code for this version only survived on punch cards because of a filling error\u00a0at a local library where it was filled under `The High Noon Duel` named after the most famous\u00a0scene in the movie. This is as close to a original reproduction as is possible after\u00a0recoding the punch card data to python.</p>\n<p><em>2021-01-07: Please be aware that this is a pygame application that is compiled with cx_freeze</em><em>\u00a0which means the python dll's are included. I have noticed that some virus software is now flagging these .pyc files as risk. Proceed on your own accord.
