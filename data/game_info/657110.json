You are in a grocery store getting supplies for your family. You must duke it out with other shoppers and survive as long as possible. Shelves are being wheeled at you by crazy people, but fortunately you can use that to your advantage and grab things off of them and hide behind them. Also you can teleport because reasons.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Weapons Guide:\u00a0 \u00a0 Eggs function as a standard bullet, but can be eaten for health as well. What a tradeoff!\u00a0 Seeds can be fired rapidly at enemies and bounce off of shelves.\u00a0 \u00a0Syrup slows enemies down and butter speeds you up! Be careful though, you can fall victim to your own syrup, and enemies can take advantage of butter. Also no, you can't teleport out of syrup, nice try ;)\u00a0 melons serve as protection, place them strategically to block enemy fire,\u00a0 soda grenades clear an area if you're cornered, but they're a last resort, the breadstick can be used to smack enemies and deflect enemy fire, the banannarang slices through enemies and always returns to you,\u00a0 and the bologna can be sued to temporarily blind enemies that fire, rendering them unable to shoot.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Probably will make a steam release with more content later.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Developed By Nathan and Kevin Bryant Copyright SecretsnowconepeopleLLC 2021<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c76cc1c344f41d06b96c2c91da8251c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Secretsnowconepeople"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
