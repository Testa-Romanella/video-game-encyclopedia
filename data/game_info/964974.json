Players can arrange them to do various tasks as mentioned above, but the cultivators have a high degree of freedom in specific tasks they do every day. In situations of fatigue, stress, and poor health, they may not necessarily follow the player's instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are also many buildings in the game that players need to earn money for their sect before they can build. It is worth mentioning that except for the secret realm that will gradually open up and become more difficult according to the exploration progress, other buildings can be used directly after construction, without the need for Lv1, Lv2, Lv3... This way, they can gradually upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe more sect buildings there are, the more civilians can be attracted to visit or shop in the sect. Developing new pills or magic treasures, or hiring cultivators to break through new realms, can also increase the reputation of the sect in the cultivator circle, attracting more cultivators to come to the sect, giving players more opportunities to choose better cultivators.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPills can be divided into five types: Qi recovery, healing, combat, health preservation, and beauty. Only cultivators can purchase the first three types, while civilians can only purchase the latter two. The materials required for refining pills mostly come from cultivation in the spiritual field, while a small portion come from exploring the secret realm. However, exploring the secret realm can yield the seeds of spiritual plants.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough magic treasures are divided into more types, only monks will purchase them. The materials required for refining magic treasures mostly come from exploring secret realms, and a few scarce materials can be purchased from visiting monks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T03:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b137418dc070f10f32a8d4a2fc1f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5e38\u5dde\u5e02\u534e\u84dd\u5fb7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5e38\u5dde\u5e02\u534e\u84dd\u5fb7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "esrb_rating": null}
