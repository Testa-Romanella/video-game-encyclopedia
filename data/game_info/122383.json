You grew up into a normal life, with a normal job, then, suddenly, one day, you break down. You become trapped in a maze of convoluded thoughts and memories, and for some reason, you remember fragments of your old diary you kept up until a few years ago.</p><p>Find all the pages and find your way out of the labyrinth before you get consumed by your inner demons and become... a monster.</p><p>This game is very short and was made for the Ludum Dare 33 \"Compo\" game jam. I originally thought I had 72 hours, but realized I only had 48 due to plans, so I made this. :)</p><p>I'm quite proud of it. It's my first game that has a beginning, end, and story, albeit very short ones.</p><p>The game has almost no replayability: the map and notes are the same every time. :\\</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/8003a51b4f809f600c4feb6b9aec4593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MicroMacro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
