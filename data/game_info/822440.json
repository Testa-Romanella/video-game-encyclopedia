This is a game where you play as a cannon-ball operator, with your objective being to eliminate all the blue cubes in each level.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To start, use <strong>WASD </strong>for <strong>rotating </strong>the cannon. Once it is positioned the way you want it, <strong>hold space</strong> to build up momentum and <strong>fire</strong>. You will be catapulted as a dice onto whichever cube it is you aimed at.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Refer to Image 1.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>Now, upon every impact, you can use some of your\u00a0<strong>energy points\u00a0</strong>to change the direction the dice is headed. Energy points are earned depending on which side of the dice is facing upwards when hitting the cubes.\u00a0Use\u00a0<strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>to move the crosshair into position on the\u00a0<strong>holographic blue sphere</strong>, and upon pressing space, notice your dice moves in the direction your crosshair was aiming at!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Refer to Image 2.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>Please feel free to share your high score (levels) in the comments. Mine is 4!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:08:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df5c16f303eb618d81011b029b7640a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arihan10"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
