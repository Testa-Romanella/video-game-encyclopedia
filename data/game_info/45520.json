Colorful and full of action, Better Off Tread trades in yet more brown military combat for a whole lot of BOOM. Up to twelve players can split into teams to blast the treads off their opponents in a variety of exotic locales. A common formula, to be sure, but Better Off Tread remembers to put the \u2018fun\u2019 in \u2018conflagration\u2019.
