{"id": 213672, "slug": "comet-express", "name": "Comet Express", "name_original": "Comet Express", "description": "<p>As ace pilots in the far reaches of space, you and a wingmate have been hired to <strong>protect a cargo ship</strong>, the Comet Express, as it sails the cosmos. During your journey, however, your client has\u00a0been caught in a trap, surrounded by <strong>warp gates</strong> ready to <strong>bombard the cargo ship with powerful missiles</strong>! Your task is to <strong>destroy these gates</strong> - and, more importantly, <strong>missiles </strong>- before they have the chance to destroy the cargo ship!</p>\n<p><em>Comet Express\u00a0</em>began as a Unity practice project in order to familiarize myself with the engine, and also began as an actual on-rails shooter level similar to classic Starfox levels. As I improved the code, I reworked the level into a simpler but arguably more replayable level more similar to Sector Z.</p>\n<p>While the game is meant to be played co-operatively with another person, it can be played and completed solo by simply ignoring the other screen. Also note that the default controller setting for both players is Controller, <strong>but Player 2 can be set to use a Keyboard by pressing K while in-game</strong>. This is just a temporary measure until I reimplement the key bindings system from back when it was a single player game.<br/></p>\n<p>The game's asset\u00a0list is composed almost entirely of royalty-free assets (most of which from OpenGameArt) with the exception of the spritework. I'll be uploading the list of assets/links soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef054a53ceebfd043bc455f6d485300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guntler"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
