For this game jam, we were supposed to reimagine an Atari 2600 game. I decided to do River Raid, which appears to be an endless flyer.</p>\n<p>All assets were created using a combination of Blender, Windows Paint, Pyxel Edit, Gimp, and Bfxr. I tried making music but I couldn't get anything put together that sounded good, so no music in my game.<br/></p>\n<p>You can use W,A,S,D or arrow keys to move. Spacebar to shoot.</p>\n<p>You are a drone, and your job is to get as far as you can. You're flying through a flooded city. You run on energy reserves, which is constantly draining. If you shoot, you use extra energy. If you get shot, you lose energy. You will need to recharge by hovering over some charging pads. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything is randomly placed in this game - there are 6 sections of buildings that get randomly chosen, and all objects placement is random as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I want to do so much more, but I will not be home tomorrow to work on it. Things like level balance, ,animated water, music, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this remake!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd28be08ee96d2dfc7141979740853b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superhardboiled"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
