Each Chibo can evolve twice, and what they evolve into depends on what stat they are good at.</p>\n<p>You want to raise your Chibo by participating in mini-games first, because <strong>if a Chibo fails in battle, it dies permanently</strong>. So be careful out there!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GBJam8, a game jam all about making a game with a few of the restrictions on the original GameBoy. If you could rate this game after playing that would be highly appreciated. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/394/394f681e95057524781d352789594849.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SBucket"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
