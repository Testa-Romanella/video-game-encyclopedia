{"id": 965189, "slug": "as-planned", "name": "As Planned", "name_original": "As Planned", "description": "\"As Planned\" is a new type of Sokoban in which the player solves puzzles by giving instructions to the slime, which repeats the same movements, in the appropriate turns.<br/>\r\nSlime can only make simple movements such as moving one step, changing direction, or sliding in one direction.Besides, they cannot remember many moves, so they repeat the same moves. As it is, of course, it is impossible to solve the puzzle.<br/>\r\nThis is where the player comes in. The player can change the slime's movement slightly by giving instructions as a bird riding on top of the slime. The instructions can only be given a limited number of times, gimmicks such as holes and moving floors that increase as the stage progresses, and the slime that does not grow at all. Your brains are tested in 50 puzzles that are plagued by various constraints.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T03:35:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a56f8dd280140c4d78dbc491c1048bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["besukohu"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["besukohu"], "esrb_rating": null}
