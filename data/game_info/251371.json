This game is being made as my thesis, I want to prove that games can be sort of a language on their own. With the use of everything except for words or language, can all the ideas and concepts of the game be understood by everyone of every language? Can four people that all speak different languages still understand and play the game without needing to explain it in all of their respective languages.</p>\n<p>(I pronounce the game title as H, it is quite difficult to make a name for a game that is absent of language)</p>\n<p>If you would like to see development on this game, I will be sharing it here:</p>\n<p>https://www.tumblr.com/blog/thedon-jon</p>\n<p>Donations not required, however they do help me in funding the project and are greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you enjoyed the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0ee022c1e7a0f83c83999a6bfa0ee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonMendezGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
