It was finally rereleased on December 8, 2021.</p>\n<p>It presents a simple mathematical problem with interactivity, but it also has some supernatural story elements. The original problem was guess-the-verby, because I only had 4 hours to make it.\u00a0 Now, in the final town, there are items you can (eventually) find to get a solution. There are five towns, each a 5x5 grid.<br/></p>\n<p>The post-comp release includes text maps for where you are and can go, and it also detects if maybe you've made a mistake.<br/></p>\n<p>You can use an interpreter like WinFrotz to play, or you can use the HTML file.</p>\n<p>There should be a discussion thread below for bugs, etc. The source is on GitHub. You can report bugs and feature requests there if it's more your style.</p><p>Thanks to Wade Clarke for finding so much so quickly after the initial release.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf7799cf68f0c75bf6065e8f3fbdc703.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Schultz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
