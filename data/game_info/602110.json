During your lunch break you hear the alarm go off, but you don't mind it, it's just a test. When you step into the hallway, however, you find it empty. Everyone is gone, the facility is under lockdown and all doors are locked. The test subjects  must have escaped and you idiot didn't evacuate when you had the chance. Now you're standing here with nothing but a pistol in the middle of an alien invasion and the only way to get out of here is to find the key cards that can overwrite the lockdown procedure and open the exit gates.</p>\n<p>I'm currently making this game as part of a solo project for my second semester at the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg. It is made solely with the Monogame framework and no additional libraries that aren't part of XNA or Monogame themselves. I'm creating this game over the course of one semester by myself, taking only sounds, fonts and photo textures from external sources. Code, models, animations, UI elements and all other textures were made by me for this project.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Left Click - Shoot</li><li>R - Reload</li><li>Esc - Pause</li></ul>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Music: \"Torn Flesh\" by Karl Casey from White Bat Audio</li><li>SFX: \"Ultimate SFX Bundle\" by Sidearm Studios</li><li>Photo Textures: from Texturise</li><li>Key card Texture: from MyFreeTextures</li><li>Font: \"Evil Empire\" by Tup Wanders on Fontspace</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:33:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9e6b8bef5d2aa5182587e4151ee7fb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chandrion"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
