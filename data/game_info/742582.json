After glancing at the chat, you remember your friend that you haven't played with in 5 years. You can't help but wonder if he's still waiting for you where you used to meet up.</p>\n<p>The Lost Isle's is my second finished game and my first game jam game. I created all the assets myself except for the animations for the bipedal creatures and some of the sounds. The human animations all came from Mixamo and a few of the sound effects are from the YouTube Audio library. I made all of the character and object models using MagicaVoxel, created the soundtrack with BeepBox, and the opening cutscene was made using Microsoft PowerPoint. The game is still a little bit buggy and some of the AI get's hung up, so thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T07:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/cca1fad78a0377bb7f9c22942e23fec2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamingMonkay"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
