Our goal with this project is to create an interactive and 'living' ship that can be explored using VR devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and more.</p><p>The model for the HMS Unicorn is being built in-house by our very talented modeler Christian Tornholm-Lehn for both the VR Museum project as well as the project Hearts Of Oak: Conquest of the Seas. Due to the detail of the model needed for both a museum quality replica and use for gaming it will be one of the most accurate 3d ship models made to date. Because the real HMS <em>Unicorn</em> is 'in ordinary', meaning it has a house over the deck and does not have rigging, we are using the sister ship HMS Trincomalee as the base of the rigging portion. Both are <em>Leda </em>class ships, with minor variations in design so the rigging should be extremely similar.</p><p>This is still a <em>very early</em> build (around 40% complete) that only has some of the basic features in place. The final build will be much more like a museum with some interactive displays and information placards to learn more about the ship and life aboard in the age of sail.</p><p>If you run into any issues, please let us know at support@saltyseadogs.net </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a3/4a3ee3226c0e5cee433b7415f4a7fe4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Salty Sea Dogs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
