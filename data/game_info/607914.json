The left mouse button is used to select single units or to drag a box around multiple units. Left clicking on an enemy will set it as the primary target for the selected units.</p>\n<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>\n<p>This was an early Unity prototype I developed back in 2019 with the intention of releasing it on the play store, however the interface never really worked on smaller screen devices. This was the first project where I created the majority of the models myself using Blender, this was a good learning process and did a lot to improve my modelling skills. That said it also dragged out the project time significantly.</p>\n<p>I've decided to post it after all this time to get feedback so please leave a comment below regardless of whether you love it or hate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:18:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b99ce65f6de14042b24d83e45bff9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Curious Dog Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
