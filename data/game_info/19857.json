Do not let the enemy destroy your space station - they are many and they are very angry... Make your own epic space battle and winning strategy! </strong><br/><br/>It is a nice twist of classical shooter and tower defence. We have developed a unique idea, which combines an original space shooter, tower defense (manual control of your turrets) and something like strategy (placing turrets, units, structures). No more boring destruction going along a predetermined path of enemies - lets fire in all directions! You have a base, some laser turrets...and maybe you have a luck! It is really cool fun game for a \"time-killing\".<br/><br/>Key features: <br/><br/>-Cool superweapons for massive destruction<br/>-Base and turrets upgrades<br/>-Tons of different bonuses (drops from destroyed enemy ships)<br/>-Interesting unusual levels<br/>-Insane evil bosses<br/>-Great sound and music<br/>-Lot of fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/730925f6d82146d49de07420b4c293fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 115}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casiualogic"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Casualogic"], "esrb_rating": null}
