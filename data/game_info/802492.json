{"id": 802492, "slug": "the-old-war", "name": "The Old War", "name_original": "The Old War", "description": "It has been a generation since the mists came. They swept over the empire like a wrathful god and enveloped the lands in their cold embrace. Cities and towns were swallowed and cut off from the rest of the world. Any who entered the mists disappeared, never to return.<br/><br/>Finally, the mists have lifted and revealed what was hidden for a generation. Where once there was rich soil, beautiful forests and plenty of game, there is now blackened dirt, strange plants and twisted beasts. Dark creatures and monsters inhabit the new world, and where before there were towns and villages there is not a trace. <br/><br/>Rebuild your village, explore the new world. Reunite the lost empire. <br/><br/><strong>LEAD YOUR PEOPLE</strong><br/>You must lead your people out into the new world. Choose your leadership style. Will you be an effective administrator? Dominate your foes in combat? Or will you harness the chaos, using spectacular magical powers?<br/><br/><strong>BUILD A CITY</strong><br/>Create a burgeoning city out of the ashes. Develop your resources, research new technologies, and put your people to work. Invest in better training or superior buildings and make your city the center of a blossoming new empire.<br/><br/><strong>TRAIN A CUSTOMIZABLE ARMY</strong><br/>Your army stays with you throughout the game, so take care of them! Every loss is one less fighter for humanity. Purchase upgrades and equipment, gain experience, and learn new abilities. Each unit has the capability to become a mighty hero, or becoming another forgotten name.<br/><br/><strong>COMPLETE STRATEGIC QUESTS</strong><br/>Follow the main questline of each territory, or do side quests to bolster your forces. <br/>Train a veteran army of knights, hire conscripts, or recruit wanderers from the forests. Take out your enemy supplies, befriend the local towns, or knock down the front door. The choice is yours in how you defeat your foes.<br/><br/><strong>ENGAGE NEUTRAL FACTIONS</strong><br/>Many a strange creature has survived the mists. Clans, creatures, towns and cities have survived the onslaught. Make alliances, trade, or wipe them off the face of the earth. <br/><br/><strong>PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS</strong><br/>With a new civilization comes new responsibilities. Divide the labour by enlisting a friend to develop your mines, construct your cities, or explore the world. There are a thousand different jobs needed to be done, and who better than your friends?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T07:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/319b94502677badf9532a736d1e5b7af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Marshall"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Warchest Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
