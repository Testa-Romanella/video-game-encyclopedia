New knowledge and abilities will aid you on your increasingly challenging skyward journey. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA single game is quick and simple: reach the sun with as much silver as possible. Silver represents both currency and score so purchasing useful power-ups must be balanced with the long term goal of a respectable grade. Death will start you back at the beginning with nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe controls in Thy Kingdom Crumble are a little different than your usual platforming. Left clicking will have you jump towards the cursor and a right click activates any equipped abilities. WASD does as WASD does.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/5700dd469d7f5e4bbb0c098004aa1207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Julian Edison", "JulianEdison"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Julian Edison"], "esrb_rating": null}
