We were required to remix/re-imagine a 80's/90's video game. We had to pull a game out of a hat and my team got Track and Field. We had a great team and delivered a good project, sadly we came second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Great fun, I remixed the theme tune and did\u00a0the sound design. This is my 3rd ever video game I have had anything to do with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a66f326e0fbcb9ae8f68d07d74bf0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin 'SIRNARIO' Cupid"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
