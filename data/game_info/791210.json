On Android, you'll need to use whatever kind of package manager your phone has to install the APK file. Try googling your specific phone model plus APK if you don't know how to do this.</p>\r\nAre there any differences between the PC and Mobile versions?\r\n<p>They're completely identical. If you have the option, I would recommend the mobile version, since it was primarily designed for that platform, but you won't miss out on anything by playing on PC.</p>\r\nHow do I play?\r\n<p>The game features a short tutorial at the beginning, but a ton of information can be found in the Tamer Help section, which is located in the Monster Office (the right building on the main menu).\u00a0 You can also check out some of the videos on my youtube channel where I discuss the game.</p>\r\nI always lose!\r\n<p>1 vs 1 quick battles are inherently somewhat luck-based due to matchup dynamics, but getting a second attack of a different type will help a lot.  When you get a third monster, you can do 3 vs 3 quick battles, which are more consistent since you can switch out of bad matchups.  For daily and event battles, you'll need a monster with nearly maxed-out stats for its evolutionary level.  When a monster has eaten all the candies it can eat before evolving, it'll be ready to take on these opponents.</p>\r\nHow do I get more candy?\r\n<p>Early on, the daily challenge board and expeditions are the easiest sources of candy.  Once you have a 30-candy monster, you can take on stage 1 daily battles and the weekly event to significantly boost your candy income.  You'll want to hang on to a few maxed out monsters at each stage rather than evolving them so you can continue to win these battles.</p>\r\nI'm not getting any sound\r\n<p>It's not a glitch, the game just doesn't have any sound effects or music. I never have these turned on when I play games on my phone, so it wasn't a high priority when I was making the game. Maybe I'd consider adding some if the game became popular, but with it being a one-person project it was beyond my means at the time.</p>\r\nHow do I play online?\r\n<p>Make sure that the host has port forwarding set up for the port that you're using if you're playing over the internet (this shouldn't be necessary if playing locally). Also, make sure that both the host and client are using the same port and that you have the same version of the game.</p>\r\nWhat do I do if I find a bug?\r\n<p>For now, you can just mention it in the comments section. I may eventually set up a discord server for the game if there's demand for it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T15:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d4ab03a385444355a5d3f4bda6d07b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Tero Softworks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
