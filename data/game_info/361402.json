{"id": 361402, "slug": "blood-mage-md", "name": "Blood Mage M.D.", "name_original": "Blood Mage M.D.", "description": "<p>\"Blood Mage M.D.\" is a top-down action dungeon crawler similar to games like The Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon. Play as the titular Blood Mage M.D. as you destroy your enemies, but keep an eye on your health bar! All that blood's gotta come from somewhere, and you don't want to run yourself dry.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Hi,\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for playing our game. We made it for the GMTK 2019 game jam. The theme is Only One, and in our game we have only one resource, blood. Its used as health, ammo, and a powerup. You can pick up\u00a0blood that you fired\u00a0 when you are low on health and enemies drop blood splatters that can overcharge your health and\u00a0your fighting skills. Try to complete all the rooms without running out of ammo, or health (its all the same).</em></p>\n<p><em>We are: TNT b.a.\u00a0 (aka Anton Vinogradov and Hudson Newberry)\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>Sprite sheet provided by\u00a0Buch:\u00a0http://blog-buch.rhcloud.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:27:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1c7fb37de6ed1af3e0ed6f055ce95b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["garyyo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
