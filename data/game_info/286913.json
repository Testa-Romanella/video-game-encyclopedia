The idea of the game is to make the player remember things. The more the player progress throughout the game, the more things to remember.</p>\n<p>Firstly, to navigate through the maze, the player will need to memorize the colors that are given to them at the bottom left corner. Through this journey, they are required to pick up one item out of the many items while they are returning to the start point.</p>\n<p>We believe that the more times the player plays this game, the more it will help them remember stuff like, where did they left their keys or where did they left their walking cane.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay Screenshots :</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed96f17ae31e630d001fb2acc80ff535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yucchi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
