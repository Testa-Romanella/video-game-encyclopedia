[DEMO]", "description": "<p>\"But I love you.\" is a visual novel/dating sim...or at least, it starts off that way.</p><p>Once you get in town, the occupants all flock to you, intrigued by the stranded newcomer. At first, they try to help in their own little ways, but as they grow attached, they try to convince you to stay with them. Forever. That's when you notice things are very, very wrong in this town, from the datable characters to the setting. Once the player starts to notice a trend of the girls starting to be slightly, well, nuts, it becomes a horror game. The game still features multiple endings like a dating sim, some of them romantic, some where nothing happens, and a few where the player is...dead. You also have the option of ignoring all of the bad stuff and pretending everything is a-ok to keep scoring with the ladies.</p><p>Pre-order the full game here through the Paypal link: http://www.novellagaming.com/bily/</p><p>And please report bugs through the comment section.
