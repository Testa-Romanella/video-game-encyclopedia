(alpha 0.2)", "description": "<p><em>This game is in an early stage of developpement: any of the features (except the character customizer) are fully fleshed out and can at any moment be removed from the game ! <strong>BUT the ones described here are most likely going to stay, just change in execution and use !</strong></em><br/></p>\n\n<p>For now, the only part of the game you can play is on this interface: the Experimental Virtual Operating System (Ev O.S. for short)<br/></p>\n<p>You can customize the look of it using the <strong>\"customization\"</strong> opition, or by entering some lines of codes <strong>(by pressing TAB on your keyboard)</strong>. Customise the color, icons, audio, logo, time style and language you play with, and\u00a0more to come (like volume for exemple)...<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can (and in the futur, should) customize your own virtual Explorer</p>\n\n<p>For now, you have access to two body types, and many gear to chose and customise the colors of, with even a logo customiser</p>\n<p><em>In the futur, at least three more body types will be added. And two of them will not be humanoid</em></p>\n<p><strong>You can also export your Explorer, so your friends can import it and play with it ! </strong><em>(for now they will only be able to see and modify if, but in the futur they'll get way more out of this)</em><br/><br/></p>\n<p>And if you really like to type on your keyboard, why not use the extended code system ? (since it's a demo, all the gear parts are already unlocked: making it mostly useless)</p>\n\n<p><em>here are all the curent commands to customize your interface, you can see them all in by entering a command in the extended terminal</em></p><p>- To open the extended terminal: <strong>extendedCode.START()</strong>you then need to open the list of command (that will be entered in the normal terminal):<br/></p>\n<p><strong>terminal: commandList<br/></strong>and then close the extended terminal: <strong>extendedCode.STOP()</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T11:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0ef7295810f110ee573532be3fe3691b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HultraFox"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
