That didn't stop me from participating though.</p>\n<p>My jam goals were to focus on lighting effects to make the game look decent, and only use the default Unity sprites. It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>\n<p><strong>------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Void\u00a0Runner is a game about a strange creature, sacrificing it's life for numbers...</p>\n<p>Play through a minute long level, with a choice:</p>\n<ul><li>Play through the entire thing on 1 health, for maximum points</li><li>Play it safe, and just try to get through the level, not focusing on points.</li></ul>\n<p>The theme of the jam is 'Less is More'. Less health is more points.</p>\n<p>Comment your high score in the description below, I'd love to see it!
