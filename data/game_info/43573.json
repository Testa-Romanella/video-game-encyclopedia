Powerful dukes, regardless of competence, will require a seat at the table, and those left on the outside will be more likely to plot against you.</p><p> Keep your council happy, and the mighty vassals will resist the pull of faction and civil war. Dismiss their interests, though, and you may find yourself trying to hold together a council at war with itself.</p><p> Balance councilor skill and power to keep your dynasty safe and strong. Ignore powerful underlings at your peril, or simply buy their loyalty with favors. Conclave makes the royal council a force unto itself.</p><p>Main features:</p><p>\u2022Councils can now vote on changes to realm laws \u2013 or you can try to limit their power and influence</p><p>\u2022Revised education system for royal children, with new traits and events designed for childhood</p><p>\u2022New diplomatic system that prioritizes marital alliances and non-aggression pacts, as well as the possibility of coalitions</p><p>\u2022Improved military combat model with a greater emphasis on morale, as well as new rules for mercenary companies</p><p>Crusader Kings II appreciates the subtlety of court intrigue.
