Avoid enemy cubes on the left and right as you collect points.<br/><br/><strong>Cube Zoid</strong> uses a novel game-play concept that splits your device screen down the middle such that you guide a 3D cube on the left and the right at the exact same time. Watch the center for upcoming rows of enemy cubes that you must dodge as you collect points or grab other helpful items such as a force field or even TNT that will explode all the blocks on a single side of the screen. It takes a few tries to get the hang of, but you will quickly be a cube dodging pro.<br/><br/>Features include an online leaderboard and achievements, though you are not required to log in to enjoy the game.
