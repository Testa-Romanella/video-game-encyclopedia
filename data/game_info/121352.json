The middle mouse button allows you to pan around the network whilst the scroll wheel lets you zoom.</p><p>The left mouse button allows you to select devices in the network, select programs to run and select each node on the route that you want your program to travel to its target.</p><p>The right mouse button cancels any programs that you have selected so that you don't have to send them.</p><p>During the cutscenes, once the text has stopped scrolling, click the screen to continue.</p><p><strong>Credit &amp; Thanks:</strong></p><p>Design, art and story by Nathan C.
