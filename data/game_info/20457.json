The developers insist that their game is designed for joint playthrough and name the genre as a tower-defense coop. Therefore, efforts on a single campaign were apparently less elaborated than on multiplayer, so the singleplayer in the game is secondary.</p>\n<p>Visually the game is a heap of swirling nebulae, among which there are several strips of a battlefield. Is necessary to arrange the towers at special points along with the battlefield. The towers look like clots of energy, which, as the enemy approaches, begin to attack.</p>\n<p>During the completion of the game, players have separate resources, and they can build at any point of the map. So there is a little need for cooperation. The appearance of additional players on the map almost does not affect the gameplay in any way. Although the existing arsenal in the game can appear huge, de facto players only have three main types of towers to deploy: ice, poison, and fire. The rest are their upgrades, which must be built separately for some reason.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/676/676980aa78adec19a441f0c56ea502ba.jpg", "website": "http://www.microblastgames.com", "rating": 1.75, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 1623, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 20}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 72, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 72, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Microblast Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microblast Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
