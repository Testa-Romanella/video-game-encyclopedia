But fire rate is very slow, once you shoot your missile, you'll have to wait some seconds to recharge. For this reason you need to get the maximum precision when you fire to enemies.</p>\n<p>Big boss is waiting for you at level 11, you need to hit it 10 times to destroy it. It is able to shoot several missiles in every direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc69d939a3db127077f42ad6cb0940f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ginodp2015"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
