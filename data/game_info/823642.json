That sheriff, who 30 years ago had freed the town from criminals, has become the worst tyrant in history. Sheriff Bill MacColl had kept them subdued by promising to give them the role of their lives. Then came the 8-bit crisis and they resigned themselves to the greatest forgetfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow the retro returns and, the forgotten characters rebel against the power usurped by the evil sheriff, and prepare to free themselves from the oppressive yoke, in this isometric view retro action and puzzle game. We are in an isometric adventure with 160 rooms, allowing you to reach the end of the game through multiple paths. It is important to mention that some of the obstacles will require a lot of skill and speed, so we are facing a game with the high classic difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy Alfonso Fdez. Borro's tribute to the legendary Spanish development company and its characters (Sheriff MacColl, the bikes from Ground Zero, our hero Yuri Dimitrov from R.A.M. and some other well-known character).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T06:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0cda6dd6da206b1cab553d29ca9373.jpg", "website": "https://erbesoftware.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Topo Siglo XXI"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Erbe Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
