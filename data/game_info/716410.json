A game about earth with no soil to plant real plants. \u00a0You have been to space for 10 years to test plant life on different planets. You return and see this monstrosity and plant artificial trees to keep humanity alive.</p>\n<p>Controls on moon</p>\n<p>WASD : walk around</p>\n<p>Controls on Earth</p>\n<p>B : Toggle\u00a0planting mode</p>\n<p>Drag right\u00a0mouse : Move camera</p>\n<p>These trees are not good life source but are good enough. Trees will die after a while if not watered. Trees have 5 different stages : Sapling, sprout, half done, done and elder. They are harder to water as they level up. Bamboo can also be unlocked.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>You need to press the water bucket to equip it then after placing a plant, press on it and its percnetage will go up. \u00a0If\u00a0it stays in the green for long enough it will grow.\u00a0BE WARNED:\u00a0Elder plants have a 50% chance of dissapearing when the percentage is\u00a0high, if you want backup trees, keep it orange! Plant as many trees as you can in 10 mins or untill you loose them all. GOOD LUCK</p>\n<p>I hope this all made sense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1223751cf4e40985dbb1e5b8835183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InvictarQ"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
