I just can't stop playing! It's fun and never ending and addicting...... It's one of those games that's a time waster! I lay in bed at 6:00 pm and when I look at the clock after I played this game it was 1:00 am!!! And I'm not done yet, I'm gonna go play some more! BYE!<br/>By Cindy9903<br/><br/>Addictive!!!! <br/>My eight year old brother got this app it looked really stupid. Later I tried the app and it was so much fun! It is really easy to use and great for road trips!<br/>By Balletgurrrl<br/><br/>Great Game! <br/>This game is great. Three generations of our family play this happily, without fighting, looking at each other's creations, and cheering each other on. This is game works well, even for my 5 yr old granddaughter! It is addictive and I would recommend it to everyone, even using it to help hand-eye coordination.<br/>By RngrLdr<br/><br/>Funny and cute <br/>I downloaded it thinking it would be a alpaca evolution type game. But then I realized it's more like cookie clickers and it's just SOOOO funny and cute to watch<br/>By Fashion love<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br/><br/>Subscription options<br/><br/>In our game we have the following subscription offer:<br/><br/>Weekly Diamond Membership offers weekly subscription for $7.99 after 3-day free trial which make your in game production double and removes all ads.
