As my first foray into Game Jams.\r\nUnfortunately even with the 10 day window of this jam, I was unable to ensure I had enough time to achieve everything I wanted. However, I did learn a lot and that was what really mattered on this project!</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>Set inside the Earth's outer core, whilst on a science mission you have encountered strange beings of a hostile nature. Fortunately some of that science gear comes in handy.\r\nUse your photon guns to eliminate the hostiles. They are also used to discharge heat from the hull, enabling you to not only keep the hull within temperature but also deal extra damage to enemies!</p>\n\n<p>All credit to myself for Art/Graphics and Game Design.</p><p>Most importantly looking for feedback on the work done so far up to this point. Especially on ways to improve going forward!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e51a8ba79675e1697e3693c1bab7f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TankDS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
