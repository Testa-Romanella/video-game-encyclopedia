There are also lots of ways the camera could be improved: panning to players to start their turns, tracking shots when the player is out of fuel, and there's a rotation bug that makes it spin too much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac8817c03c35c7a2f879fba2d4b80a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dwemthy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
