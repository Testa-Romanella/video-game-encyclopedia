Use the movement keys/joystick to rotate cubes, causing them to roll unpredictably. (Cubes must be sacrificed so you can move through the level!)</p>\n<p>Very minimal (and messy!!) code, the concept was mostly tweaking physics and level design.</p>\n<p>I was only able to complete 2 levels, but they're pretty big. Enjoy the super hard section at the back end!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e20d4e43f09375746fd4f7cceb840b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mybluecorners"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
