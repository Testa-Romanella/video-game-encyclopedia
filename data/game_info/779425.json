I've created it as my 12th grade project at my school in a few months.</p>\n<p>You play as a Fly Momma and your babies have been kidnapped by mean spiders! Jump through the 2 Levels to collect them.\r\n</p>\n<p>Level 1 has 95 flies and Level 2 has 155 flies.</p>\n<p>The music is from \"Beetle Bug 3\". A childhood game of mine and big inspiration.</p>\n\n<p>Even tho I shoved this project for months, because of mental health and other projects... am pretty glad. I want to use Unity in the future. I've learning many Unity Basics in this prebuild Platformer, so that was a good idea.<br/></p>\n<p>And I've drawn all the graphics and learned how to do sound effects, of course there's always room for improvement. I like the cute characters.\r\n</p>\n<p>Updates may or may not come. Thanks to my stress I didn't finish some little things I actually wanted to do for the school project. Like a Level 3, animations, a fly baby counter, and some config.... but it's okay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T13:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f3a76199f2cf9fcf252d5df43a0a5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yanntastisch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
