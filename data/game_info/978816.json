The number and variety of quests will not let anyone get bored. Some tasks you can complete without hurry, in others you will have to do a little jogging. Some will require the use of a car. We do not want to reveal too much. See for yourself.<h3>CRAFTING</h3><br/>What is crafting in Forest Ranger Simulator? It's creating useful things from literally whatever you can find. Sometimes you'll definitely feel like MacGyver.<h3>GATHERING</h3><br/>In order to create something you first have to tear it down. Specifically, we need to acquire materials for building and crafting. To build a table we will need wood. In addition, in the forest we can find many other valuable things like mushrooms.<h3>LEARNING</h3><br/>Forest Ranger Simulator is a game, however, we wanted to include as much valuable information from real life as possible in the game. Thanks to the notebook you will learn a lot about the work of a Forest Ranger, you will also find many interesting facts about forests, such as information about mushrooms. Learn by playing. The name simulator obliges.<h3>WORKSHOP</h3><br/>Workbench. There's nothing like having everything at hand. Saw, pliers, hammer, paintbrush.... and many more tools ready to go. Why not build a bird feeder?<h3>DAY &amp; NIGHT</h3><br/>The profession of Forest Ranger is not a job from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Here you have to be on guard day and night. Remember that the night is dark, and the only light is the glow of the moon and your flashlight. Watching the sunset or the beauty of the moon.... priceless.<h3>CLEANING</h3><br/>Forests, it's not just trees, leaves and animals, it's a ton of trash left by people. You will find more than 150 different trash here. Sometimes you will be surprised what you can find in the forest. Remember that everything has to be sorted. You have special trash garbage cans for this. Some skills as well as large garbage bags will be helpful in cleaning up.<h3>EMERGENCIES</h3><br/>A Forest Ranger has to be alert at all times. You need to observe what's going on in your forest and quickly intervene with a threat. Maybe it's a smoldering fire, or maybe poachers have set up snares again. <br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T10:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6dbf60a7ae589d77a0da39883993c18e.jpg", "website": "http://www.freemind.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freemind", "VIRTUAL MAGIC", "HOT CODE COMPANY"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FreeMind"], "esrb_rating": null}
