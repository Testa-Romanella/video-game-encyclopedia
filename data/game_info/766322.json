One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>All quotes above are from Albert Camus. All in all, we can\u2019t delay the inevitable. The boulder will roll down again. The work will need to be done again. You can delay, slack negligence it all you want, but it has to be done. Again, again, again, and so on. Sisyphus may be happy but we are just doomers who faded to work until our final and inevitable demise.\r\n</p>\n<p>And like all classics arcades, your goal is to delay the inevitable end of the game and maybe have some fun in it, like Sisyphus rolling his rock up and down. We added a little twist to it: your coworkers remember you: you can play all you want, but it has to end so you can work more\r\n</p>\n<p>We opted for pinball machine-like from the gameplay and development side, using most of Godot\u2019s physics engine and less code. We have some issues and the game may seem unpolished since we hadn\u2019t time to balance it enough. Anyway, we wish to pass this doomer vibe while you can enjoy the visuals and music until the inevitable end.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447ea79bfca0843f0d6795ad3b1750c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KeichiTS", "jaspior", "joaoppar", "Chagas12", "ivfreire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
