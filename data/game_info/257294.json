In a continuous 2km * 2km play zone, you can walk in the eternal city and find famous sites like Colosseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum etc, and even the Temple of Claudius, Theatre of Pompey that can not be seen today. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers can also find information panel for important buildings, some of them with photos of according ruins today, which were taken during my travel.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI created this game in serious attitude. For making this project, I travelled to Rome 4 times, spent 2 years in researching archaeology and architecture of ancient Rome. All I have done is to make sure these reconstructions are more correct, and give you the most exciting VR experience in Ancient Rome.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease follow VRRome on facebook or visit site below for update information:<br/>\r\nwww.facebook.com/vrrome<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWeclome back to Rome!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSteven Luo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07acd1571f57ddda78aac3f75e6295e9.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/vrrome", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Luo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steven Luo"], "esrb_rating": null}
