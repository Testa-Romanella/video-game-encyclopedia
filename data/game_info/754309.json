You can\u2019t see with your own eyes, but you have your teddy bear with you that grants you vision.\r\n<p>By picking up, carrying and placing the teddy bear at different locations you gain new perspectives around the house. Don\u2019t walk too far away from your teddy\u2019s eyes though, since the kidnapper could be right around the corner.</p>\n<p>Set in 1980's Sweden. As the girl with her teddy you need to solve the puzzles that will allow you to escape your kidnapper\u2019s house.
