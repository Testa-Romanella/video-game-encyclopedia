It's very unpolished and janky because I kind of got bored by the end\u00a0and wanted to just finish it to move to my next project (which will be a full game), but I improved my gamedev skills a lot while making it, so I think I achieved what I wanted from this project. I don't think there's need to add more to this game in the future. If you happen to play this game, I hope you at least enjoy this very unpolished and\u00a0short experience.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\n<p><strong>Filipe Galv\u00e3o - Assets I did not made are listed below</strong></p>\n\r\nAssets not made by Supernatural Stardust:\r\n<p>Adventure Creator by Chris Burton (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/adventure-creator-1189...)\r\n</p>\n<p>Haunted PSX Render Pipeline by Nicholas Brancaccio (https://github.com/pastasfuture/com.hauntedpsx.render-pipelines.psx)\r\n</p>\n<p>Soundtrack (Prey, Get Out, The End of Civilization) by Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio (https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio)\r\n</p>\n<p>SFX from\u00a0https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc</p>\n<p>BlueSakura Brush Font by\u00a0<strong>Haris Prawoto - (https://befonts.com/bluesakura-brush-font.html)</strong></p>\n<p>Tango Sans Font Family by\u00a0<strong>Sandylukee - (https://befonts.com/tango-sans-font-family.html)</strong><br/></p>\r\nTextures and/or images from:\r\n<p>https://www.cgbookcase.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/</p>\n<p>https://unsplash.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:43:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f36/f36cd9124d2d3c5094051b38968981ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supernatural Stardust"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
