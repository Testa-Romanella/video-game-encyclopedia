Zombies!!! </h3><br/>Take on the horde and relive your game nights with the original cult classic rules, available on Steam for the first time! The same game you knew on Mobile, after many years, is now live on Steam. Play a multiplayer game against any user on supported platforms ( Windows, macOS, iOS and Android)<br/><br/>Zombies!!! puts you in the middle of the action in this video game adaptation of the hit board game. To escape the ever-advancing zombie horde, players must use a combination of wits and brawn to be the first to the heliport and certain escape. The only problem is, the zombies are everywhere, they appear to be very hungry and your opponents would really prefer if you didn't escape. However, there\u2019s no need to take this horde on your own. The game allows up to 4 other human or AI players to join in on the fun. AI players can be chosen from 10 different characters, each with a unique play style. <br/><br/>Take on the Standard Game Mode, building your game board one tile at a time and killing zombies within the confines of the official Zombies!!! rules. Generated Town Mode drops the players into a premade town with Zombies in wait to make you their next meal. Survival Mode is the ultimate test: You versus a town full of zombies!
