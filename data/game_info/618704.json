It still is finishable, but it's pretty darn hard. So if you have the same item twice, chances are you already rendered the game unbeatable. We are deeply sorry and hope you'll give it another try after the rating period has ended.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71c4a7383893d43fbfa84b3013439ff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shanzhai", "LLlarsO", "yurgio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
