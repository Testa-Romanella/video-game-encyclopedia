The game took 19 hours, 47 minutes, and 39 seconds from start to finish. Seems like I passed the challenge. But due to the rushed nature of it, game balance, fun, grammar, and a cohesive story is all but guaranteed. It was something I wanted to submit for Ludum Dare 42, but I decided against it for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>\n<p>Join Daniel, Amber, Nicole, and Kyle, a group of rookies looking to become adventurers, as they start a strange new tale of misfortune, meeting strange people in strange lands, and encountering strange situations. How will their \"Anti-Adventure\" unfold? Go find out!</p>\n<p><strong>PLAY FOR FREE</strong></p>\n<p>It's a short game. You can probably get an hour out of it. It's a classic turn-based RPG. It's also free! But I won't complain if you feel like sending money my way.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong>Arrow Keys<br/><strong>Confirm:</strong> Z, ENTER<br/><strong>Cancel:</strong> X, ESC<br/><strong>Page Back:</strong> Q, Page Up<br/><strong>Page Forward:</strong> W, Page Down</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de79bf81dd0c5a10622f5e70de697f84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hands-On RPG Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
