A solo project made in two weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>Outrun the man on your prototype Turbocycle by day, then blast off into the stars on the Jetrunner to shoot down monsters by night! Turbo Jetrunner is a super fast-paced arcade game that combines old-school racing and on-rails shooting, in that order, with a trippy pseudo-3D visual style.<br/></p>\n<p>The game that - somehow - took GXC by storm is now available to be downloaded for your Windows computer. If you use the Opera GX browser, play in browser here!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to steer/move\r\n</li><li>c - accelerate/shoot\r\n</li><li>v - drift\r\n</li><li>x - turbo/bomb\r\n</li><li>z - brake (bike mode only)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gamepad controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left stick or pad - steer/move\r\n</li><li>Right shoulder button or trigger - accelerate/shoot\r\n</li><li>X (square on PS-style) - turbo/bomb\r\n</li><li>A (X on PS-style) - drift\r\n</li><li>Left shoulder button or trigger - brake (bike mode only\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Drifting, turbo, and bombs all consume AP.

It also, in less than a month, became one of the most played games on the service. I don't know how this happened - I blame the loud, obnoxious GIF that I used for a cover image.</p>\n<p>Turbo Jetrunner is a solo project. All assets made by me, except for the fonts Upheaval and Edit Undo, both by Brian Kent.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T11:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fa/1fa04a9df66de76a1113522cefa34347.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RhyminGarFunkle"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
