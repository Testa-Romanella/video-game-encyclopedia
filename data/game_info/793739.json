It was never supposed to happen, but the steady disruption has convinced even the most skeptical. Pain and confusion reign across the lands.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is but one place that still holds harmony: the Cadence, an ancient building made to create harmony and life thousands of years ago. But the Cadence has lost its strength over years of neglect, and even it will fall to the Discordance eventually.\r\n</p>\n<p>You, the most naturally gifted among the people of Harmonia, were given the holy Songblade and sent to retune the songmetal rod of the Cadence and restore harmony to the world. It will not be an easy task, for the Cadence was built to keep out all but those who wield the Songblade with precision and poise, and most of its secrets have been lost to time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck, hero. May harmony find you. <br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Jump - Up arrow</p>\n<p>Slash - Down arrow</p>\n<p>Play tuned music - Space</p>\n<p>Open instrument panel (including volume option) - I</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Some notes / tips:</strong></p>\n<p>A main mechanic of Songblade involves listening for particular instruments in a song. If you're having trouble figuring out the combination, try focusing on identifying each instrument option one at a time, rather than all of them at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, the flute tends to be a bit soft, so that's often the one you'll be missing.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, just guess some combinations!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Design, Coding, Writing, Art</em><br/></p>\n<p>Jaco van Hemert (https://jaco-van-hemert.itch.io/)<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Music<br/></em></p>\n<p>Carel van Hemert (https://itch.io/profile/skyystorm / https://soundcloud.com/carel-van-hemert)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T06:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f028bc8dfac0b3e35dca2588e2201835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaco van Hemert", "SkyyStorm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
