Once you reach zero health it's game over!</p><p>The game is still a work in progress. I'm aware the music doesn't quite match up, it's free from opengameart.org I am looking to create my own soundtrack and add special pickups and possibly other modes. Maybe even turn it into a rhythm game or something. I'm open to any suggestions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a0de3dd78835a92351b2e27230a9ca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TomMarsland"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
