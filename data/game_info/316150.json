There\u2019s just one rule!  The numbers scattered across the grid tell you how many squares you must light up around each one to solve the puzzle\u2026 and that\u2019s where the skill comes in!  One mistake can lead you down the wrong path!<br/><br/>\"This is quite simply one of the most beautiful puzzle games I have ever played. The design is simple, yet aesthetically pleasing, and the soundtrack is a wonderful sonic wash that perfectly compliments the gameplay. The puzzles themselves are well pitched. The introductory rounds are small enough to lend themselves to both a studied approach or random tapping. They gradually ramp up the difficulty level, and with so many to work through, there is great value for money to be had. Now, off to the iTunes music store to buy the soundtrack...\" - an App Store customer from the UK.<br/><br/>Radiant Grid is an immersive, minimalist puzzle game with a soothing, ambient soundtrack.<br/><br/>99 increasingly challenging, handcrafted puzzles.<br/><br/>A simple concept that will give you hours of relaxing game play.<br/><br/>** Soundtrack now available on iTunes and Apple Music **", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb045deeb73751dd890bef743b284cd3.jpg", "website": "http://www.openplanetsoftware.com/radiant-grid", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Open Planet Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Open Planet Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
