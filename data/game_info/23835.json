The game will \n      feature all of the levels contained in Shift 1 and 2, along with 100 \n      all-new levels designed specially for this release.\n    </p><p>\n      Many have tried to emulate the gameplay of Shift since its first release \n      in 2008, but none have managed to capture the frantic, mind-bending \n      nature of the series. Players are tasked with making their way through a \n      series of perplexing rooms, equipped with nothing more than their \n      ability to \"shift\" the playing field. Is a wall blocking you from \n      progressing? Flip that level upside down and turn that wall into a pit!\n    </p><p>\n      Of course, that's only the beginning of the challenges players will \n      encounter in Shift DX. The road to victory is paved with mysterious \n      items, complex environmental puzzles, and a variety of deadly traps.\n    </p><p>\n      Features:\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Over 100 brand-new puzzles\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Shift 1 and Shift 2 levels included\n      </li>\n<li>\n        New Shift Challenge gameplay mode\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Create levels with the Level Editor\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Share levels online as QR Codes\n      </li>\n<li>\n        \"Pop-Art\" and \"Classic\" visual modes\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Unlockable playable characters from several indie games\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7dd3405cdbfbc0d713fd93c34798b2.jpg", "website": "http://choicepublishing.com/game/shift-dx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Choice Provisions"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Choice Provisions"], "esrb_rating": null}
