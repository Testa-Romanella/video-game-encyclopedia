You're trying to beat your binging habit (let's say form a certain streaming service called N Flix, no better Net F) and for that you need to gain willpower before your life ends and you realize that it was wasted.</p>\n<p>Braking a bad habit can be really tough, so I liked the idea of each bad habit being a Boss Fight. Of course I wanted to do more bosses but time is up.<br/></p>\n<p> I really enjoyed the experience, I have a lot of ideas on how improve the game and I'll probably will.</p><p>You can check out the code in Github: https://github.com/bugtective/killthehabits<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724cc72d16b032abe6a1bebd7e162124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bugtective"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
