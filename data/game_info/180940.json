Only the Intro/ outro needed to be created but I din't feel like it at the time. But now I finally finished up the game and made a few small improvements to it. Its fun to play so who knows and I will make some more levels, bosses and special weapon/ armour shops.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is my take on the online course by \"James Doyle\". </em>Most sprites are from this course some other graphics and sounds are collected online and partly edited by me.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Space<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>links used:</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.udemy.com/unity2dplatformer</li><li>http://www.freesfx.co.uk<br/></li><li>https://opengameart.org<br/></li><li>Google.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/160/1602b2919e4b54f2f5551b7c128489e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["GULDOR, Learning to Code"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
