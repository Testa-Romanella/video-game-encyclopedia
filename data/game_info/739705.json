{"id": 739705, "slug": "drawize-draw-and-guess", "name": "Drawize - Draw and Guess", "name_original": "Drawize - Draw and Guess", "description": "Drawize is a fun online multiplayer drawing game where players draw and guess words. One player is the artist - when their turn starts; they get 3 words to choose from, then they have to draw the chosen word. The other players try to guess what the artist is drawing. The game is played in several rounds; points from each round are summed to create a rank list and determine a winner.<h3>Public and Private rooms</h3>You can play it online in public rooms with random people worldwide whenever you want - there is always someone online! Also, you can play in a private room with your friends. The private room option is great whenever you and your friends want to play remote but together, and also is a great fun activity for remote meetings or to play with coworkers. There is also a Teams mode in the private room - it is great for big groups (up to 100 players!) that can be divided into teams and play in the co-op mode (team members collect points together and compete with other teams).<h3>Quick Draw and Quick Guess</h3>There are two single-player modes when you want to play on your own. Choose <strong>Quick Draw</strong> to choose a word and start drawing for practice, or <strong>Quick Guess</strong> to practice guessing drawings other players have made in previous games.<h3>Daily Challenge</h3>There's one special word every day, known as the <strong>Daily Challenge</strong>! Draw it and compete with other players to earn the artist of the day title. The winner is determined by the number of votes that each drawing gets from other players (you must be level 3 or higher to vote).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/0302c235bae3781341a3331b4186919d.jpg", "website": "https://www.drawize.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lomboos"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Lomboos"], "esrb_rating": null}
