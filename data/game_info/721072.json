It is also not a long experience, but one you will hopefully want to return to.<br/><br/><strong>A Word from Designer Johnnemann Nordhagen</strong><br/><br/>As a game designer, you often find yourself doing research on how other games do things - it's a good way to get ideas, see what works and what doesn't, and build an understanding of the space you're solving problems in. Usually this research involves buying a lot of games and playing until you get to the part you want to see, if you can remember the games that have it! <br/><br/>How nice it would be, I thought, if someone collected all the reference for particular ways of doing things in one place. Thus was born the Museum of Mechanics, and the first entry: Lockpicking. Many genres and types of games include lockpicking minigames, so I thought I would do an exploration of a broad swathe of them and gather them together in a single place. This is the result. I hope you'll join me in exploring the different ways this has been done through the history of games.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T04:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cf17d80d6353986d05875828eb55752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dim Bulb Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Dim Bulb Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
