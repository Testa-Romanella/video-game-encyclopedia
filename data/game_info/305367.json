During that time, his whole family disappeared without a trace. Since then, he's been living alone, all by himself, having only one friend; Eliza Davidson. Now in his Junior Year, it's happening again. Two students have disappeared, and they were seated in front and behind Derek! Is anyone who comes in contact with him fated to disappear? But if that's the case, what about Eliza?\"</p>\n<p><em>A Shadow's Reflection</em> is an eerie Kinetic novel. Though it has been put on hold, the game will be finished very soon. The aim is to release a completed version before 2019 ends.</p>\n<p>For now, please enjoy the original demo released in 2013 to get a feel for the game. Please note, as it is a demo, some parts about it are incomplete and it contains some typos (and I meant \"landline\" instead of \"LAN line\" lol).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:38:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15df7893682c441ca52a4882fafe815e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tofu Sheets Visual"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
