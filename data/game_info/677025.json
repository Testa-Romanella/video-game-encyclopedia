You were performing your final experiments, when something went horribly wrong. Your prototype Time Machine has malfunctioned, and you have been teleported into a strange, illusionary labyrinth-like version of your familiar Laboratory. To get back to your dimension, you must traverse this odd new world outside of time, and find scattered parts to fix your machine.</p>\n<p><strong>==== Puzzles ====</strong></p>\n<p>To find parts, overcome a series of puzzles involving time loops. Each time you cause a time loop with 'R', a new clone of yourself will be created, and will copy your movements and actions leading up to the time loop. Use your clones to help you through the laboratory, but be warned, coming into contact with a clone will cause a time paradox!</p>\n<p><strong>=====================</strong></p>\n<p>Submission for MiniJam 90</p>\n<p>I may expand on this game eventually :)</p>\n<p>This was kind of an ambitious project for a weekend of time, and the final result may be a bit rough. Though,\u00a0I thought this puzzle mechanic was a fun idea,\u00a0I am happy with what I was able to get done for the amount of time we had. I hope you enjoy this short puzzle game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df3d1b0b6c992da9885d76f307bfec33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tsuki"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
