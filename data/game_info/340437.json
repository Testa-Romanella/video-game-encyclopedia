Man, it's been a while since I've made a game!</p>\n<p>Here's\u00a0 game I was inspired to make by a game jam called \"Crappy Game Jam\" where you're supposed to make a game that's... well... crappy. Pretty straight forward from the name.</p>\n<p>Kitty Drop is a short, simple game that I made because I wanted to try out a game engine known as Godot and honestly I think I'm sticking with this for a while. The goal of the game is to catch as many goldfish in 30 seconds that drop from the sky with your kitty character.\u00a0 Use the left and right arrow keys to move and each goldfish is 10 points.</p>\n<p><strong>Please keep in mind</strong> that considering this game took me about 30 hours to make, (about a day) and it's being entered in a Game Jam known as the \"Crappy Game Jam\" please don't expect TOO much. I'm currently working on a game similar to my first project \"Tippy The Turtle\", and I think it's going to be pretty cool! :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm also still tinkering around with this game, so let me know if you have any ideas to make it better and I'll be sure to add them in.\u00a0</p><p>The best part about this game engine is that you can export it for multiple platforms! So it's available for Linux, Mac and Windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anywho, thanks guys! Have an awesome day!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a79ef39d31b8f88111ccaa74f915d11f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LilacRoses"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
