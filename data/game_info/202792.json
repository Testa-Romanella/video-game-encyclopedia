The theme of the jam was \"contraception\" and we decided to center our game primarily around the conversations that arise through physical intimacy. All of us felt that the emotional and interpersonal aspects of sex were under-explored in sexual education courses. Calmtraception likewise explores some of the common anxieties and consequences that come with not being wholly honest with a partner. We think that this game sheds a new light on the ways in which sexual education can be discussed, and we had a ton of fun making it as well. Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914529f1e2e7f162a6adb627c2079def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Dellapi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
