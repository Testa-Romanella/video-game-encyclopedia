Complemented by breathtaking artwork and an addictive soundtrack, you can't afford to miss this amalgamation of young talent!<br/><br/>You play as a thoughtful young soul, bumbling your way through late adolescence; you've been through a lot for your age and consequently are a little numb. This is why you don't bat an eyelid when, out of the blue, you're transferred to yet another school, in yet another remote location. Little do you know that this small island is nothing like the others, that the events that occur on it will change everything.<br/><br/>In an already niche genre of storytelling, Always The Same Blue Sky stands out as a truly unique seaside adventure; a timeless tale of love, mystery and humanity.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-26T17:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2490bec87900d8eadd6d6af1ea57d1b3.jpg", "website": "http://alwaysthesamebluesky.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 100, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NeoNight", "crimsonnight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeoNight"], "esrb_rating": null}
