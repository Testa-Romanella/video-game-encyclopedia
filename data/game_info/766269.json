You collect firewood to keep a fire burning in your hut, so you can top up your warmth when you're done for the day, collecting food along the way in the form of berries, worms, millipedes and nuts. You also had the option to collect hats to slow down your rate of lose of heat. As the days progress, winter gets closer and it therefore gets colder, making you lose warmth much faster. A leaderboard would track the furthest days you got to.</p>\r\nControls \r\n<p>WASD / Arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p>(yet to be implemented) - Space for collecting items and interacting with objects</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\ud83c\udfa8 The amazing Suzie on the artwork, actually got everything done in time, all hand painted! <br/>\ud83c\udfb5 HzA creating the background track - and potentially more if I end up completing this game</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcbb Hamdogu (myself) on programming and everything else<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c7836f7e7f3936985d9ee078e16b4bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hamdogu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
