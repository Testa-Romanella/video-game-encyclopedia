The point of the research was to evaluate diegetic gaze interactions (such as attention) that adapted a narrative and its effect on feelings of immersion.</p>\n<p>The game is thus meant to be used together with an Eye Tracker, but can be played without. We tested and developed the game using a Tobii 4C Eye Tracker, Tobii's Unity SDK, and Unity 3D 2020.2.6f1.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>- Look around: Mouse<br/>- Move around: WASD<br/>- Interact: E<br/>- Escape: Info &amp; Quit Game<br/>- Respawn if stuck: I<br/>- Toggle crosshair: O<br/>- Start the game: P\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Created by:</strong><br/>No Alexander G.
