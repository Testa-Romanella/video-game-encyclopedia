Build up a plant based defence to protect the trees from both land and air. Try to overwhelm them by planting the whole field with your defences, or prioritize a few choice plants and level them up, the choice is yours!<br/></p>\r\nCharacters\r\n<p>Whats that, you wanna know who your trying to protect? Well, lets meet the residents of Eden!<br/></p>\r\nOracle Tree\r\n<p>The Oracle is the leader of Eden, and is all knowing. They tell the travelling heroes about Eden, and all the diverse plant life that inhabits it - as well as each ones strengths and weaknesses in the battle against the evil candy. They also tell the heroes about all the candy warriors that seek to destroy Eden, and how they have learn to defend against them. The oracle was the first tree in Eden, and due to this has the highest respect.<br/></p>\r\nMrs Applebee\r\n<p>Mrs Applebee is the local shop owner and weaponsmith, she sells a variety of items for the heroes to use. She doesn't want gold or treasure however, she merely wants your help in rescuing all the fallen children of her kind strewn throughout the land of Eden. Her rewards include upgrades for the defences of Eden, and unlock access to even more of them as well.<br/></p>\r\nSergeant Switch\r\n<p>Sergeant switch fought gallantly against Eden in the early wars, however he eventually saw the error of his ways and switched sides. He uses his insider knowledge and experience to lead the heroes into the never ending battle, commanding the warriors in all areas of Eden.<br/></p>\r\nDr Dexter\r\n<p>Doctor Dexter is often referred to as the smartest tree in Eden (Except the Oracle of course). He uses his vast knowledge to educate people on all aspects of Eden at all ages, from when they learn to move, to advanced battle tactics - as often as they require.<br/></p>\r\nMonsieur Mort\u00e9\r\n<p>Monsieur Morte is the brother of the Oracle, and nearly as old as them. He is old and withered, Scarred and Maimed, and tired of war. He respects everyone, even those who seek to end their war campaign, or even take a break, and guards the portal out of Eden.<br/></p>\r\nTia the Tiny\r\n<p>Tia the tiny is a mere Sapling, learning the ways of Eden. She is too young to go to war but helps in other ways - by showing you the hall of the creators. She gets very upset if visitors don't visit at least once....<br/></p>\r\nSenorita Settings\r\n<p>Senorita Settings is the tinkerer of Eden. She can change things here and there to help you if you have poor eyesight, are hard of hearing, or have a black heart and aren\u2019t encouraged by beautiful music in the background.She can even to reset time and go back to the beginning of the war- though be warned, no one but you will remember this, so it will be as if you had never been there\u2026<br/></p>\r\nTowers\r\n<p>Whats a Tower Defence game without.. towers? In this game you have a different arsenal of trees at your disposal. You can use them to build a path for the candy to follow as well to shoot them down! Plant, upgrade and sell your trees until you have the perfect defence! So, lets see what you've got at your disposal!<br/></p>\r\nPeashooter\r\n<p>The Peashooter: A quick-firing tower with multiple targeting capabilities, making up for its lower power with agility in combat.<br/></p>\r\nSlow Banana\r\n<p>Slow Banana: A tactical tower that slows down ground-based enemies' movement.<br/></p>\r\nCherry Bomb\r\n<p>Cherry Bomb: A powerful tower that delivers a devastating explosion, effective against multiple ground enemies at once.<br/></p>\r\nAnti Air Carrot Field\r\n<p>Anti Air Carrot Field: A tower that specializes in taking out flying saucers with high-damage carrot projectiles.<br/></p>\r\nBoreal Tree\r\n<p>Boreal Tree: A tower that creates a zone that slows all enemies that come into it.<br/></p>\r\nPollen Trap\r\n<p>Pollen Trap: A trap that creates a zone filled with pollen, causing all candy with noses to sneeze.<br/></p>\r\nSniper Reed\r\n<p>Sniper Reed: A tower that boasts a large range and can take out enemies from a distance with its high-damage cattail projectiles.<br/></p>\r\nCandies\r\n<p>Now, you've seen what weapons you have but, what are you up against? Evil, sour, candy, thats what! Here you can learn about these sour little sweeties, hopefully you'll learn enough to be able to take them down!<br/></p>\r\nLittle Jellies\r\n<p>These little jellies are slower and weaker than the other sweets. So, shouldn't cause you too much trouble, right? Their path is shaped by the trees you plant and the other obstacles that already exist. Slow them down and blast them to keep Eden safe!<br/></p>\r\nJelly Beans\r\n<p>The Jelly Beans are much quicker than the little jellies. They have a bit more health too! But, you can take 'em, right? Their path is shaped by the trees you plant and the other obstacles that already exist. Slow these quick beans down and destroy them!<br/></p>\r\nGummy Bears\r\n<p>The Gummy Bears... everyone hates the Gummy Bears. These big guys are slow but they are tough. What's worse, just when you think you have killed these guys, they split! Their path is shaped by the trees you plant and the other obstacles that already exist. Get rid of these guys as soon as you can, don't let them reach Eden!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>When the Gummy Bears are low on health, they can't support their large heads any more! The heads roll off but are still dangerous! Their path is shaped by the trees you plant and the other obstacles that already exist. Beat them quick, don't let them get aHEAD of you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Without the weight of their heads on top, the Gummy Bear legs can keep walking and they just wanna kick Eden down! Their path is shaped by the trees you plant and the other obstacles that already exist. Apparently, the legs have an extra advantage over the other candies, due to not having a nose. Destroy them, don't let them kick you when you're down!<br/></p>\r\nFlying Saucers\r\n<p>The Flying Saucers have one advantage the other candies don't have, they can fly over all of your trees! Shoot them out of the sky with some Anti Air Carrots! Don't let them through!<br/></p>\r\nTree Bases\r\n<p>In every level there is at least 1 tree base, this is what you need to protect. The enemy candies will travel towards the tree bases and will deal damage to you once they reach them. Stop them at all costs!<br/></p>\r\nHealth\r\n<p>When an enemy sweet hits your tree bases, you health will go down. This tree shows you your health, try to stop it from getting destroyed!<br/><br/>Work your way through the levels to try your skills against numerous preset map layouts and minion waves, or head into endless mode, where the waves are endless, and the board is completely clear for you to make your own, how long can you last? This top down tower defence game will keep you occupied for hours, and with the cute pixel graphics it is suitable for all ages.<br/><br/>Music has been done by Arman Mkhitaryan of\u00a0https://twitter.com/mkhitaryanpr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T14:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b367170ac6a8bfef375dbf9e27bc33d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MI Pixel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
