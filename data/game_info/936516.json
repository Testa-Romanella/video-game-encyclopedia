Tap and drag around to attract particles. Simulation is in 3d space using somewhat accurate Newtonian physics.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Press space to spawn more particles.\u00a0</li><li>Press C to change the color palette.</li><li>Click and drag to apply gravity.</li></ul>\n<br/><p>Dev Notes:</p>\n<p>This game is rendered\u00a0using nothing but a single html div and a giant box shadow string. No game engines, no canvas, no gpu magic.\u00a0I find that by adding limitations one ends having to be a bit more creative to get a result. This project was an experiment to see how far I could take a single box shadow on a single div element. It is just 100 or so lines of code. Nothing complicated. Git hub source code can be found here.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I'd be interested in taking this further so any ideas on mechanics or the like to try out do let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T05:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17b/17bdbd72b0f530607491085d6fcfeee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rustystump"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
