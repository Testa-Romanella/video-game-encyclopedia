{"id": 413514, "slug": "the-great-grub", "name": "The Great Grub", "name_original": "The Great Grub", "description": "<p>\"The Great Grub\" is an arcade game where you have to navigate your caterpillar through a rough terrain. You must collect enough food so your caterpillar can become a pupa and metamorphose into a beautiful butterfly.</p>\n<p>Many obstacles on the way won't make your life easier. If you don't eat enough your pupa will starve. Fiendish insects roam the area and they all want a piece of you. By fleeing from them make sure not to bump into walls.</p>\n<p>For your aid there are 5 Effects that you can apply to help you to survive this hostile environment, e.g. Medicine for your health, or Venom to stun your enemies.</p>\n<p>The free version allows you to play 30 out of 50 levels. If you reached level 31 you need the full version of the game, then you can continue your game where you left off.</p>\r\nWhy sell a beta version?\r\n<p>The game is complete and tested, there are no obvious bugs. Most importantly, all <strong>future updates are totally free</strong>, even the final version. The Spanish translation is still missing because I don't speak Spanish...</p>\n<p>The main focus are the levels, I haven't had time\u00a0to test them all...\u00a0I invite all players to test the game and highly appreciate your feed-back about the levels, anything about the game that isn't fun, or tell me your ideas and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in \"The Great Grub\",</p>\n<p>Arthur V.
