You must call upon your zombie pals by using the space bar to collect all the flowers (you gotta touch the flowers at the same time, or the power of friendship won't work, and you can't progress to the next level). Don't forget, zombies lose their basic motor skills, so you have to navigate the world by rolling. Good Luck!</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits for Unity Assets used:</p>\n\n<p>Character Model:</p>\n<p>SUPERCYAN -\u00a0Character Pack: Zombie Sample</p>\n\n<p>Set Dressing/ Props:</p>\n<p>TOBYFREDSON -\u00a0TRP - Ruin Pack</p>\n<p>DREAMERZ LAB LTD. -\u00a0Low Poly Bed Room Furniture PBR</p>\n<p>TERRAC00P STUDIOS -\u00a0Wood and Stone - Easy DG</p>\n<p>GAME ASSET STUDIO -\u00a0Ornamental Flower Set</p>\n\n<p>Textures:</p>\n<p>SHMEL STUDIO -\u00a0Cracked Seamless wall texture and material</p>\n<p>SHMEL STUDIO -\u00a0Sand Brick Texture</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/6794251f2981a4e824262584ad5dc651.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Margaret Castellanos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
