XD).</p>\n<p><strong>List of Features from Adventure that made it or didn't make it:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Black and Yellow Castle and their keys (no white castle)</li><li>The Bridge is now a hole in the wall that you can pick up and move to different walls if they are thin enough, it's basically a portable hole.</li><li>There is also a ladder that you can move around.</li><li>There are two maze rooms.</li><li>A magic sword for Dragon killing.</li><li>One Dragon (so that you can put your shiny new magic sword to use!)</li><li>No Dark Caves</li><li>No Magnet, No Bat</li></ul>\n<p>There's probably more but I forget right now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d8517be862e53a4c939ac927e233eb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["BrainSlugs83"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
