The original project broke on builds, was buggy and had issues with breaking the user's browser.\u00a0 This version was rewritten in Godot for hopefully better stability and usability along with faster development times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't export a web version, for some reason. However, please enjoy the builds provided below. Also, this will slow down your computer considerably at higher world scales, so be patient and don't turn the slider up to max.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>If you are using keyboard, you can move around with the wasd keys and zoom in with q and out with e.
