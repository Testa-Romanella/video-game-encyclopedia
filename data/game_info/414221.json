Made in Bitsy in one week for the 2020 Games Aid Mental Health Jam (#GamesAidMHJam).</p>\n<p>Borksy\u00a0was used to include various hacks that made this game possible. I can include a full list of hacks used if requested, in comments or elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This is based off of my personal experience living with mental illness. Everyone's experiences are different, and not all are shown the same way. Hopefully this game helps others experience the kinds of things I do.</p>\n<p>This game is far from what I initially envisioned, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, bugs encountered, etc. I'd love to hear everyone's feedback!</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cc/2cc363cace6a834e6fc4f25e5badb58f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kai et al"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
