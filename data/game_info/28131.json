Players will gather in teams to collect items that they can use to build a Fort during the day and to defend against zombies at night. Construction will be the main mechanics, a lot of items will be in the game. Players can build and edit each wall of their Fort, build stairs, roof and windows, sculpting them according to a particular need. The terrain and map in the game are randomly generated, and players are given various ranged weapons (like a sniper rifle) as well as edged weapons (like a katana). You can also create weapons, and character skills can be customised through upgrades.</p>\n<p>The game features four different classes: ninja, alien, commando, and builder. Different classes have different abilities. For example, the builder builds faster and cheaper, and also strengthens the buildings themselves. And the ability to melee is much better in the ninja class than in other classes. Players can also destroy environment objects and scenery to get resources.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-10T15:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d97/d97f663b752a6484df105993f17abb49.jpg", "website": "http://fortnitestormchasers.com/", "rating": 2.98, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 2072, "beaten": 82, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 512, "playing": 141}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 804, "suggestions_count": 621, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 814, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "iOS"], "developers": ["Epic Games", "Epic Games Poland"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
