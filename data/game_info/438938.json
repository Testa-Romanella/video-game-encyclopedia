The most painful was losing the inventory system because I didn't have the time to create working items for it. But at the very least I can now say I've technically created a working game, so I'll call it a win.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7be3f186880c0fa8eefac0f46b9c0648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tegoto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
