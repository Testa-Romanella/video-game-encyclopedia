Defend yourself by screeching, collect power up, and beat the high score of this fast faced shooter game. Remember, you only live once.</p>\n<p>Move the player by using W(up), S(down), A(left), D(right) and use the mouse to aim and left click to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>This was the game that our team made on our very first global game jam on 2017. The theme of the jam was \"Waves\". We brainstormed came out with the idea of a 2.5 shooter and the player is a ghost (ooohhh! scary!)\u00a0that would\u00a0use sound waves as his attacks . Unintentionally, our enemy spawn controller is so fast that it creates waves and waves of enemies and it made the game very hard. We received a certificate titled \"You only live once\" because of that.</p>\n<p>This is an unfinished game so expect it to be buggy and should be played on window mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:06:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb212ee7154a0f0f06c5a5eea922364b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CPOrt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
