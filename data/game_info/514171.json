To exact your revenge, you must kill\u00a0 all of the citizens, and rid all life from the village. But the witch hunters and police will be after you! Civilians can't see you as a werewolf, but will report bodies to the police. This means that a civilian seeing a body will clear it up and report it to a police, and the number of police or detectives will increase! You can pick up and drop bodies in more hidden places to stop this happening. In the day, police will not suspect you unless you are carrying a body, but in the night, if they ee you, they will hunt you down. This means carefully plotting kills at certain times, and moving the bodies in the day.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move, and Space to pick up\u00a0bodies, drop them and kill innocents and witch hunters.</p>\n\n<p>Programmer: Jellybeans</p>\n<p>Artist: PixelMochii</p>\n<p>Sound Designer and Composer: Kiberptah</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/160/160a35412d5a830262a690a84c49fa98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelMochii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
