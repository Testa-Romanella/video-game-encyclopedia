I pray thee dance for me. I am sad to-night. Yes, I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I slipped in blood, which is an evil omen; and I heard, I am sure I heard in the air a beating of wings, a beating of giant wings. I cannot tell what they mean .... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance for me. Dance for me, Salom\u00e9, I beseech you. If you dance for me you may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even unto the half of my kingdom.&quot;\u200b<br />\nSalome was a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. But it is Oscar Wilde&#39;s 19th century play Salome that really inspired Fatale. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. In Wilde&#39;s version, Salome falls in love with the prophet. He rejects her and she has him executed. The play ends with her kissing the lips of his decapitated head.<br />\nMost of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts.<br />\nExplore a living tableau filled with references to the legendary tale of Salome and enjoy the moonlit serenity of a fatal night in the orient. Fatale offers an experimental play experience that stimulates the imagination and encourages multiple interpretations and personal associations.\u200b<br />\nHow to play Fatale:<br />\nThe Cistern: Think of Fatale as a role playing game.
