This game concerns Rick Anderson and Allen Tombs, employees of Rick\u2019s Detective Agency, who skilfully compare the daily newspaper to a ransom note to find their client\u2019s daughter in the Case of the Rich Man\u2019s Kidnapped Daughter. Despite the fact that nearly all the enemies sport apparel clearly reminiscent of 80\u2019s/early 90&#39;s fashion, the game is set specifically on October 3, 1939.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T07:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ac/3ac583ec6e2bbf6e81f80ba752a49c7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": [], "developers": ["C.P.
