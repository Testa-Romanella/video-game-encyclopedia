The game jam was held from March 17th 2023 at 5:00 AM to March 20th 2023 at 5:00 AM. It is a short game that I plan to expand in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to pick up healthy snacks in order to keep your health high. Once the health counter hits 0 the game ends. The game uses arrow keys as controls. Press and hold the Enter key to restart the game after the game over screen.<br/><br/>Assets:<br/></p>\n<p>Backgrounds &amp; main music - infinite runner pack by Eder Muniz https://edermunizz.itch.io/infinite-runner</p>\n<p>\u00a0Character - Hooded Protagonist by Penzilla https://penzilla.itch.io/hooded-protagonist</p>\n<p>Food - Food and kitchenware by Poloviinkin https://poloviiinkin.itch.io/food\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - 8-bit / 16-bit Sound Effects by DJWasabi https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack\u00a0</p>\n<p>Effects - VFX starter pack by Leonardo Zavala Cuevas https://sangoro.itch.io/vfx-starter-pack\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c42c42b59203822c247a55cd1cfcc08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zuzexx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
