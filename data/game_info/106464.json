Fabricate shams. Pull scams. Misrepresent. Sneak. Steal. And make sure to pay off your debt to the local crime lord before your time is out.</p>\n\r\nWhat is the Web of Deceit?\r\n<p>In this rogue-lite you play as Nereza Blake, a con artist and burglar, in a procedurally generated renaissance city. You complete scams in order to make money to pay off your debt to the local crime lord Capa Boccini, before he comes for your hide. To achieve your goals, use <em>social deception</em> or <em>stealthy burglary</em>.</p>\n<p>In social deception you can craft new false identities for yourself and dupe your mark by lying about the properties of items and citizens. NPCs communicate with each other and propagate their knowledge (as well as false information that they have been fed). Avoid getting caught with a lie before you are done with the mark. <br/></p>\n<p>Alternatively, sneak into your victim's house and take what you want. Fighting the guards is not an option for Nereza - you have to rely on careful hiding and nimble stealth.</p>\n<p>Eventually each con will inevitably start to crumble and angry citizens will be out for your blood. Be ready to escape into a new identity before you are trapped in your web.<br/></p>\r\nMain Features\r\n<ul><li>Social deception</li><li>Crafting of Personas and other fabrications</li><li>Lie to influence NPCs</li><li>NPCs propagate information between each other</li><li>Top-down, third person stealth</li><li>Procedurally generated world</li><li>Permanent death</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\r\nNereza stealing the guard's customized crossbow right behind their back</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\r\nFabricating a new identity <br/></p>\n\r\nAnalytics &amp; Privacy\r\n<p>We collect analytic data about the gameplay in order to further improve the game.
