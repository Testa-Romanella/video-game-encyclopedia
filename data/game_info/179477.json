I had an issue that prevented me from uploading it to the jam's website.  The drop down menu wouldn't display the game title so I couldn't enter a submission.  The seconds ticked down to the end, and it didn't get submitted.  But with luck, the problems got resolved and I even included a mac build!  Yay!</p><p>I'm very inexperianced to making games, and even less so when it comes to making jams.  In the end, I couldn't finish out my script.  I ran into a couple scripting complications so what is there ends in a big cliff hanger.</p><p>I included the script with the prototype .zip file in hopes that the rest of the game could be imagined from the base of the prototype.</p><p>Things happen, you select options, and you have a conversation with the game.  It's a very \"dating sim\" approach, but I wanted to focus on writing dialogue.  I could use the practice at it.</p><p>Please mind that it has minimal art and no sound.  This is due to a mix of time, the fact that I was doing this solo by myself and I have limited resources for things like sound, and that I was focused entirely upon the writing.</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819382916ced87a3f038557063763153.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Casey Shreve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
