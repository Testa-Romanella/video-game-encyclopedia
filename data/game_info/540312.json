If your piece will\u00a0end on an occupied position, it will be frozen and it will not fall down, giving you the possibility to move it freely until you find a free space to place it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:03:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/81561ce84b33c367cd0508d35b8edde8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["gcris95"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
