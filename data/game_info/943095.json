{"id": 943095, "slug": "vanguard-alpha", "name": "Vanguard Alpha", "name_original": "Vanguard Alpha", "description": "<p>This is a game I was developing about a year ago. It is a top view space shooter game which has some physics, similar to Asteroids. It has more complex gameplay than Asteroids, as it has objects that your ship can bounce off, and also has several weapons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also included is a 2 player duel mode. This mode is tricky to play on small keyboards, because player 1 uses W, A, S,D to move and Space or J to shoot, while player 2 uses the arrow keys or numpad keys and ENTER to shoot. If you have 2 gamepads and can map these keys to gamepad buttons, the 2 player mode is much more fun and easier to control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The development of this game was postponed as I am focusing more on Operation Excision, my retro FPS. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1850624a2f92747bc59c7a1bb90791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paladin Twelve"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
