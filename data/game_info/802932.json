So press ENTER whenever you're at something that seems important. Like to continue dialogue, go into a ship, or collect an item.</p><p>A simple platformer with some action elements. You play as Blaygo, a space courier. Blaygo has suddenly received a request to deliver a package to a dangerous planet. You need to travel there and deliver this package, and hopefully not die in the process.</p>\n<p>This is a \"demo\", and is not technically finished or polished. But I wanted to move onto a different project, but at least make the game completable. So, if you encounter a bug or seemingly unbalanced feature, there's your answer. More games will be coming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db094bdd0edd711e4fc6d15f630c820c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whatahooda"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
