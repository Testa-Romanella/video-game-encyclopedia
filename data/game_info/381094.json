Ukraine, Oil, freebies and stereotypes!", "description": "<p>If we were to describe our game in a few words, they would be Ukraine, Oil, freebies and stereotypes!</p>\n<p>Yes, these are the definitions given by people who see our game for the first time. We don\u2019t deny it, it's true! The game is built on these stereotypes, in the best sense, and therefore is interesting and exciting!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the trilogy, Highly Likely, is a surreal 2D Adventure about a funny and somewhat naive character called Mikola who is trying to do all he can to save his homestead.</p>\n<p>The story unfolds in a most ordinary Ukrainian farmstead near the Polish border, where the main character, Mikola, lives with his wife. In pursuit of his dream, he lands in tough circumstances and finds himself facing the threat of total ruin. It would seem that it's over, and there\u2019s no hope. However, fate gives our hero a chance, albeit a very dangerous one, in the form of an \u201cabandoned\u201d oil pipeline. Realizing that he has nothing left to lose, Mikola, without thinking twice, decides to use it and, using various improvised devices, starts a risky venture that involves him in incredibly amusing, sometimes dangerous and unpredictable adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>5+ hours of gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>A tragicomic plot in 6 acts.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>A variety of quests.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Picturesque landscapes in 23 night and day locations.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>50 characters.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>56 items for action and interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>13 types of vehicles: from a bicycle to a steam locomotive.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>130 unique animations of the main character.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Multiple movement paths that help to avoid obstacles and perform other maneuvers.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>Original soundtrack recorded with live instruments.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0</strong>A narrator! First of all, our game is a story with a fascinating and rich plot. We really wanted the players to be able to fully enjoy the game process, so that they can fully appreciate its idea, and be able to emotionally empathize with the main character. For this reason, we employed a storyteller, who throughout the game narrates off-screen events, voices the thoughts of the characters, and conducts dialogs on behalf of the characters.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to release two sequels to the game. In the very near future, the first part of the trilogy will be fully ready for launch.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Sincirely,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mikola Zaporozhsky Games team</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.\u00a0</strong>Currently, we have only published screenshots of the game environment, without the acting characters, equipment and other interactive objects. The same is the case with the video. Of course, we understand that all these ambiguities and hints do not immerse too well into the atmosphere of the game itself, but, on the other hand, allow us to create some intrigue. In the very near future we will publish new screenshots and videos with a more expanded assortment of items, equipment, characters and animals that will allow you to get to know the game much better.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.S. </strong><strong>WARNING!</strong> The uploded file is not the game itself. It is a PDF with a description of the project!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/652aff81313959efbd70d6cba51ca258.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 464, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Highly Likely"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
