The world as we know it ended, torn apart by hordes of ravenous monsters. Humanity still clings on in the sea of blackened ruins, cold ashes, and man-eating creatures.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're the leader of a caravan of survivalists whose goal is to figure out the truth behind the zombie apocalypse and, if possible, build the foundations for a new civilization! But be careful: Zombies might want to feast on your brains, but humans may very well prove the greatest obstacles during your long drive...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Explore a vast world torn apart by a zombie apocalypse, from derelict cities full of loot and zombies to new settlements founded by survivors with opportunity and backstabbing abound.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Gather food, water, fuel, and gear to survive the drive. Manage your resources to ensure everyone gets to the destination safely.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Manage your team's sanity! Manage the impact of trauma, long-term effects of injuries, and, of course, resource scarcity. Zombies might turn out to be the least of your problems...</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Build the survivor you want using a robust attribute, skill, and perk system. Experiment with combinations and character builds, from a suave lockpicker to a mindless berserker and everything in-between.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Paired with the character system is sophisticated card-based combat. Build up your deck during your travels, taking a team of rag-tag survivors to veterans with incredibly rare cards at their disposal!\n<br/>\n</li><li>Gear matters: Give your survivors an edge with weapon and equipment mods - plus a good meal - and watch them conquer the wasteland!\n<br/>\n</li><li>Build your group of survivalists to work as a team in combat!</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>The caravan is at the heart of your journey to discover the truth. Upgrade it with workbenches, storage, and other features to turn it into a true mobile base.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Swap out vehicle components to modify the caravan's performance. Engine, suspension, tires, all affect how you traverse the world - and your chances of surviving!\n<br/>\n</li><li>Craft everything you need to survive, including the classic nail-mounted baseball bat. They don't make them like they used to, after all!\n<br/>\n</li><li>With what you find in the wild, cook meals to give yourself permanent bonuses or a quick fix before a fight!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-04T04:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/450e6a06f463dac3dcacb752df9e3567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shotx"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Freedom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
