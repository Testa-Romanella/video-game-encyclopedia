(the scariest of them all.)\r\n \r\nH!GHL!GHTS:\r\n \r\nMULTIPLE ENDINGS; DECISIONS MATTER.\r\n \r\nTWO LEVELS of DIFFICULTY, offering DIFFERENT PR!ZES.\r\n \r\nTEXT is DRAMATIC and abounds in CONTEXT.\r\n \r\n15 CHARACTERS, E!GHT of whom are PLAYABLE.\r\n \r\nREWARD for unlocking all ACHIEVEMENTS.\r\n \r\nCRYPTIC SYSTEM.\r\n \r\nCAPTIVATING, THOUGHT-PROVOKING STORY.\r\n \r\nCOMPLEX PLOT, warranting multiple play-throughs.\r\n \r\nOVER 9000 lines of SOURCE CODE.\r\n \r\nIf you get a Pop-Up Window barring access at the end of any scene, simply select \u201cIgnore\u201d.\r\nAll you need is Love and a Keyboard. \r\nDON't BE AFRA!D to download the Game!! If your Malware Finder gets weird about it, it's only because the program is written in a very classic code, as happens unfortunately to be a fair deal of known Malware. While such archaic code may still be used by hackers since it's closer to the heart of a machine, (less abstract than most,) my own code is harmless, and I will stake my whole career upon this Promise.\r\n \r\nEnjoy.\r\n \r\n[({L.J.)}]", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a2011f1ff3c3d578ba0f5b2eb3e0d82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Lin Ji"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
