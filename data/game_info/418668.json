Everything looks crap right now since I was lazy with the \"modeling\". I don't have that much variety for the plants but I will add more to this game as time goes on. Please leave some suggestions on what to add to the game that would make it better, maybe an original plant or zombie\u00a0idea or a gameplay change. I will improve the models, sounds and animation and it's just an early prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/888b19d43f50bf294c7a346f2a6f76e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivanything437"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
