Pretty self explanatory, download the version most suited to your device. On android the key doesn't always unlock even if you have beaten Memes 2, so try the keyless versions. <br/>Arm64-v8a works on newer android devices, armeabi-v7a for older ones, and the x86-64 works on the simulator and chromebooks. Universal works everywhere but is larger. Rest are pc (windows), mac and linux.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T04:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/7469ef67b47cc400f1092b3cdf1e3446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Riley Fanfiction Club"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
