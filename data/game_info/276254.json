When engaging with characters, you will be presented with the opportunity to interrogate them, thus engaging in a duel of words and selecting the write responses to your opponent's statements. Through these actions you will gather clues, key information to finding out who is the killer. By opening the Accuse tab (by clicking on the corresponding button on the top left) and selecting a suspect and supporting clue, you\u00a0\u00a0must make an accusation--hopefully the right one--and catch the killer hiding in plain sight.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Team:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game Design &amp; Story: Rachel Geng, Allison Weiss, Beckett Melville, Vera Limani</p>\n<p>Writing: Allison Weiss and Rachel Geng</p>\n<p>Art: Vera Limani, Beckett Melville, and Allison Weiss</p>\n<p>Visual effects: Allison Weiss</p>\n<p>Programming: Vera Limani, Rachel Geng, and Allison Weiss</p>\n<p>Sound*: Allison Weiss and\u00a0Beckett Melville</p>\n<p>*music and sound effects are from the public domain</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/234b9e6d95fa1d467616abe3dcebe4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahw301"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
