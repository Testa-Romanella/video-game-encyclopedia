And suddenly, you're stuck in a forest... <br/></p>\n<p>WHAT IS THIS?<br/></p>\n<p>This is a very short, unofficial fangame made with RPG Maker MV based on the game \"World of Horror\" developed by panstasz. However, it makes no explicit mention of the characters or events of that game. It'll take less than 5-15 minutes to finish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was made in a week.You can also call it a kusoge. <br/></p>\n<p>Also, yes. There's almost no BGM. Only once is there a BGM playing, and it's during the battle that's pretty much impossible to lose. (There's no trick; just brute force.)<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY OFFLINE<br/></p>\n<p>You may download the whole game to play on Windows in the associated ZIP file below.
