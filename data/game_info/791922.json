It is designed to be included as a resource gathering feature of another larger game.\u00a0Players can first use the scan tool to reveal a 5x5 section of the covered tiles. After the scans have been used the player has 3 extract attempts where they will mine all of the resources directly under the cursor and mine one layer of all other tiles in a 5x5 section surrounding the main extraction point. Different tile colors show different value with gold being the highest and purple being the lowest.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T09:34:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e0f53ab8747097423db36051657fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric268"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
