I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many invisible people as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 5 art pieces to choose from, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h3>Controls:</h3>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden person, click and they will appear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h3>Difficulty:</h3>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h3>Get immersed:</h3>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for everyone.<h3>Replayable</h3>You can restore a small number of invisible people back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few invisible people left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 5 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T08:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f31e7e8adace61e63cf75777972b83fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
