Being fast paced and simple made me enjoy creating and playing it much more. I have a platoon of ideas and features that I could implement into the game currently. Being able to expand on such a simple platform is nice. On top of that local multiplayer would have been a great idea to execute\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>What went well</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I believe I was able to get a great amount completed in such a short amount of time. I would say it definitely bypassed the idea I had in my head when starting. Definitely have a game that I could add onto, polish up, and produce/add to my portfolio.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I kept pushing the boundaries and didn't really set myself enough time to polish the game as much as it should be polished. I also used other peoples code without really completely understanding them and that's killing me. Practically used over a half an hour on art I didn't use.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>What I learned</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I learned a bit more about 2D physics and more practical time management. Sometimes pretty when there is minimal time isn't the best option.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits: Sounds</p>\n<p>http://freesound.org/people/medetix/sounds/177906/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/scaevola/sounds/333261/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/medetix/sounds/177912/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/sagitaurius/sounds/93550/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/jammerboy70/sounds/398640/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/368511/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bc5dc006f8daa5e0359bca920b1bb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["weeklygrind"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
