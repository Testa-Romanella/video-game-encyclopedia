If your nucleus is uneven, you're unstable and lose mass if another atom smashes into you. If you have an even nucleus, you're good to smash and steal some mass of another atom. However, you have to work quickly, because nature alwasy tries to fix instabilities and your environment might find equilibrium quicker than you think!</p>\n<p>Move around with the arrow keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a97eb2e565301c3366a6584f2a30a915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hartoe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
