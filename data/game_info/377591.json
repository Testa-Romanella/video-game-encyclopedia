Get ready to explore different environments with their own dungeons to power yourself up and defeat bosses, all of which are randomly generated or selected. Unlock new games modes, such as rougelite style instant death, for an extra challenge. Made by a single hobbyist developer in his spare time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c5b23e55ed86989038dd89c63b96ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Tritt Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
