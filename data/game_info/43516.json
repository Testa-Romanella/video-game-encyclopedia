{"id": 43516, "slug": "equilinox", "name": "Equilinox", "name_original": "Equilinox", "description": "<p>Equilinox is a relaxing nature simulation game which allows you to create and nurture your own living ecosystems. To create an ecosystem you place plants and animals into the world, each of which has its own life-cycle, behaviour, and requirements so you need to make sure each species has a decent habitat with sufficient resources. Having healthy, happy animals in your world will earn you points, which can be spent on buying more wildlife for your world. You can also use these points to genetically modify your current species and evolve them to unlock more exotic plants and animals. You can think of it like a city-builder game, but instead of cities you&#39;re building and managing ecosystems!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ba0/ba0571819e460af4e536eb0854e8fb33.jpg", "website": "http://equilinox.com/", "rating": 3.36, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 249, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 12, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thin Matrix", "ThinMatrix"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Thin Matrix", "ThinMatrix"], "esrb_rating": null}
