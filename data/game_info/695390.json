Go all 101 while being chased down by an unknown enemy. Can you make it out alive, or will you die trying to escape?</p>\n<p>This game is based on the Third Kalpa from Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne where you get chased around by Dante. It also uses DMC and SMT music which will be changed if I work on this again which I\u00a0really hope to do :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T07:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c73dd8f8421442eb5e8decf10d892c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shiro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
