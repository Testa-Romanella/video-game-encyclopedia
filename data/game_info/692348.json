We tried to design the game around a skill-dependant main mechanic, which is this constant need of vision, using the racetrack and dodging the lights.</p>\n<p>The constraint theme was \"Off-screen\" and we decided to think about the direct visual perception that the player has and what a constant trend to saturation would do on his capacities and gameplay.<br/></p>\n\n<p>3D\u00a0Art - <strong>Antoine Monange</strong>\n</p>\n<p>2D Art - <strong>Nicolas\u00a0Terlon</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game Design &amp;\u00a0Development -\u00a0<strong>Enzo\u00a0Menegazzi</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T10:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/faea7180124d5dd8565801aa88b65116.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mnzo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
