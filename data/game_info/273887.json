To operate a room you need to sacrifice people, the Room block is an exception to this rule. Sacrifice fills resource production to 100% within the block. A status bar shows in the blocks how productive the current block is. Every second, the productivity of the block is reduced, so it has to be filled with people. Various events occur during the game, resulting in increased consumption of certain resource. The upper panel shows the status of consumption/production.The indicator turns to red if the consumption of certain resource more than the production. The exclamation mark shows that the consumption of raw resource a particular block is more than your production. At this point, you need to build additional blocks or fill the existing ones\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea5661091f4fa61c2a5a4cf158a9ff2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ikturi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
