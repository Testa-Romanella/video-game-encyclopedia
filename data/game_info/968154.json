108 territories take turns in a fixed order.<br/>When it is the player's turn to take control of a territory, he or she can take control of it.<br/><br/>Each territory can employ up to 10 units.<br/>The units invade the territory of another country and fight each other,<br/>If the defender is completely wiped out, the player gains control of the territory.<br/><br/>All countries not selected by the player in the initial country selection are controlled by the CPU as enemy countries.<br/>The game saves the game status in auto-save mode, and up to 6 locations can be saved.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Controls<br/><br/>Simple mouse operation.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Commands<br/><br/>Players select actions from command icons to advance the game.<br/>In the beginning of the game, the

against other countries.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Combat<br/> . <br/>When a unit is moved into enemy territory, the game changes from a look-down map screen to a horizontal viewpoint combat screen.<br/>Units act automatically according to their status, and the battle proceeds semi-automatically.<br/>The battle ends when the defending side is annihilated or the invading side retreats or is wiped out.<br/><br/>The terrain of the battlefield has a large impact on warfare, and each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses.<br/>For example, units that are good in \"mountainous areas\" will have high defense in mountainous areas.<br/><br/>In addition, during battle, there is the concept of time, and the strength of units changes depending on whether it is day or night.<br/>For example, a unit that is good at night will be stronger at night and weaker during the day.<br/>Some units are not affected by time.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Units<br/><br/>Units become stronger as they gain experience in battle,<br/>Some units can evolve into other units.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Internal Affairs<br/> . <br/>Internal politics is also important in running a country.<br/>Each territory can have a \"lord\" by appointing units.<br/>Units have three temperaments: low, chaotic, and neutral,<br/>The loyalty of the units in the same unit goes up or down depending on the temperament of the lord.<br/>If a unit loses its loyalty, it will disappear,<br/>Therefore, it is necessary to manage the loyalty of your troops.<br/><br/> . <br/>The intelligence and attractiveness of the lord also affect the well-being of the people and the civilization of the territory.<br/>In addition, the king has many other tasks, such as deciding the main crops of the territory and the tax rate.<br/>Crops may not grow in all climates, disasters, or in all areas of the land, and this may require some trial and error.<br/><br/>\u25a0 Events<br/><br/>You may encounter unexpected troubles such as floods or revolts.<br/>Volunteer soldiers may appear or units may disappear from their units.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T02:47:39", "background_image":
