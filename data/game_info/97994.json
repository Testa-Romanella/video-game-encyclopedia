This huge monolithic bundle includes all 20 games submitted to the jam.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSharecart1000 games share a single save file. Playing one game may affect what happens in another. Each of these games interprets the save file in its own way.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t(In this package, the save file is located at \r\n\tSHARECART100/dat/o_o.ini)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhile you can play these games through the included game loader, you can also put them inside your existing Sharecart library.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNote: These games were made by a wide variety of developers using different tools \u2014 expect some inconsistency!
