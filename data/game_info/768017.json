While his family is away and he is entrusted with keeping the order in his house, he tends to embark on adventures accompanied by his hat and surrounded by darkness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0On this particular occasion we will accompany Peter in his task of collecting the evil spirits on the house! The most important thing at night is not letting your light go out,\u00a0 no adventurer will be able to advance without being able to see where they are going, so in order to do so we will have to refill our oil lamp with the fuel bottles spread across the house. While he battles against time in order to keep his lamp on, Peter will have to search for the evil spirits, which are really not-so-evil-and-not-so-spirit-like, and capture them to keep them from causing any mischief. Peter will have to be smart and use logic to decipher the riddles left behind by the spirits and find them before his lamp runs out of fuel and he is engulfed by darkness. But even so there is no need to fear it... right?</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>W A S D - Move</p>\n<p>I - Riddle list<br/></p>\n<p>E - Collect Puppets</p>\n<p>TAB - Pause</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\n<p>\u2022Character Artist &amp; Animation</p>\n<p>Yoel I\u00e1n Motillo La Pira<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u2022UI Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Lautaro Lajmanovich<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u2022Map artist<br/></p>\n<p>Mar\u00eda Agustina Marega<br/></p>\n<p>Roc\u00edo Victoria Gim\u00e9nez</p>\n\n<p>\u2022Prop Artist</p>\n<p>Ian Agust\u00edn Le Bot Garat</p>\n\n<p>\u2022Game designer<br/></p>\n<p>Ezequiel Alejandro Aguirre</p>\n\n<p>\u2022Developers</p>\n<p>Mateo Fabbri</p>\n<p>Mat\u00edas Monti</p>\n<p>Lucas Iv\u00e1n Pich Dalbert</p>\n<p>Nicol\u00e1s Ramos Marin</p>\n\n<p>\u2022Sound and Music Designer</p>\n<p>Mr. Dorian</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>We are students of Image Campus\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd934a79e9bfa608e8a865033e1a5859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["agushmar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
