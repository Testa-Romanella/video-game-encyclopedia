Can you keep your pet alive, disease-free, fed, entertained and educated for seven days?</p><p>A few things I'd like to improve, before the end of PetJam:</p><ul><li>Click events on buttons don't always seem to work -- this is seriously irritating me. [UPDATE: I think I improved this a bit but if anyone has any clues about this I'd be delighted to hear 'em. Maybe it's a Firefox thing.]</li><li>I like that the status updates are confusing but maybe they shouldn't be <em>this</em> confusing, especially when the pet has multiple problems at the same time. [UPDATE: This is better now... I think just confusing enough without being completely unfair. Sometimes your pet dies because you weren't aware of a problem until too late, but that's kind of by design.]</li><li>It would be nice for the end screen to say a bit more about the pet's life over the past seven days. [UPDATE: I'm still adding more words all over the game.] </li></ul><p>It works in Firefox on Win 8, and on Android default browser (but doesn't scale, so good luck with that). I won't have time to test it on multiple environments so for optimal results play on my laptop. Version 2.0 would start with a complete rewrite as the code's an absolute rat's-nest at the mo... but no prospect of that for now.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02c2ffdbc51bfd260ab80eb7c3f4a2e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["endash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
