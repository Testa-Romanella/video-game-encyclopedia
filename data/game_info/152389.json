The start screen will show you your first two acquaintances, and a new one will be added after each level. The right interactions will create friendships and help you climb the social ladder. Wave, fist-bump, and hug your way to the top.</p><p>However, interacting with strangers or breaking social norms could cause a crushing blow to your social life. How high can you rise before it dies completely?</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> \u2014 Move</p><p><strong>Z</strong> \u2014 Wave \u2014 Wave at acquaintances when you have eye contact to become friends.</p><p><strong>X</strong> \u2014 Fist-bump \u2014 Fist-bump friends when you have eye contact and are an appropriate distance away to become BFFs.</p><p><strong>C</strong> \u2014 Hug \u2014 Hug BFFs when you have eye contact and are an appropriate distance away.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>Click here for my Ludum Dare (Compo) entry page.</p><p>This is my first time participating in Ludum Dare! I learned a lot, but there are definitely some things that I did not give myself enough time for. Most obviously: music and sound effects. It would have been a lot of fun to add some voice to the awkward encounters. I also should have focused on having a MVP earlier in the process so I could have realized (and fixed) the problems with the scoring system. It could certainly be balanced or even completely re-thought to a strike system or something similar.</p><p>Either way, I hope you enjoy what I came up with that weekend!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f87db7f8d9ffbeef551252c3499b86b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tddawson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
