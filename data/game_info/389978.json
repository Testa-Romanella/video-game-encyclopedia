This means that you must figure out the most efficient path to get to the queen ant without running your ant to starvation.\u00a0 <em>Ant Muncher</em> is all about finding the balance between reaching the end quickly and having enough stamina to make it there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:40:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/2056f07faceb9715ad210aa9de3798b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keysmashstudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
