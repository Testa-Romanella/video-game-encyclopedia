I have an explainer video/Devlog coming to my channel flaroon (youtube.com/Flaroon) so subscribe to stay notified. The controls should be pretty self-explanatory. It is still in development and there are many bugs to be fixed when i finish creating the video especially performance. If you have a CPU with many threads/cores you should be able to run it at a solid 60+ frames. So have fun and have a good day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T03:45:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3140fb00f5ad1a67674d41e33341eeb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flaroon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
