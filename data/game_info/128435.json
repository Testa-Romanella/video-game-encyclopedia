Or is it with your past self ?</p>\n<p><strong>Please do not forget to double click on the game display when the game is fully loaded so that it can receive your inputs. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move the character around with the arrow keys. Use the X key when on a Record button to record yourself for a short time, then replay those actions by using the X key on a play button. Restart a level at any time using the G key.</p>\n<p>The game lacks any kind of soundtrack and polish, and collision bugs are known to occur when colliding with corners. I still hope you can enjoy a bugless and enjoyable playthrough !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d763e1b5b8b7171c8c0baf47db5a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Delca"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
