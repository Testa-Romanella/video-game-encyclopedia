{"id": 911465, "slug": "gunslinger-nova", "name": "Gunslinger Nova", "name_original": "Gunslinger Nova", "description": "<strong>Gunslinger Nova</strong> is a top-down, 2d space-shooter that pits the player against swarms of alien space ships from other dimensions. Destroy all enemies and portals as fast as possible to clear each level and unlock the next. Clear all 40 levels in Campaign Mode to unlock Endless Mode, an alternate game mode that allows you to loop through all 40 levels successively until the player is destroyed. Clearing all 40 levels in Endless Mode increases the difficulty of all enemies in the game, so difficulty will continue to scale based on the player's progress.<br/><br/>Destroying enemies and portals earns the player credits to purchase new items in the shop, including weapons, projectile upgrades, missiles, and utilities.<br/><br/>There is also a loadout screen with savable presets, a basic stats system to strengthen passive abilities, and community leaderboards!<br/><br/>There is no plot. The only thing that matters is survival.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T03:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c15c5907418c3c94b4c7d128cb9a9e2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["instasiv"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["instasiv"], "esrb_rating": null}
