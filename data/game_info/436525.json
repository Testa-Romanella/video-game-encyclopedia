If you are on a touchscreen you can move spaceship and shoot by simply moving your finger on the\u00a0screen.</p>\n<p>This is my first game that I started developing while\u00a0I was following Unity course from Udemy by Ben Tristem and\u00a0Rick Davidson. Since I'm a backend developer I knew a little C# and completely rewrote the project and added some new features to it. You can access source code from Github and plans from Trello.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game still not finished and I don't know if I'll ever finish because I got bored of it so quickly. UI needs a complete overhaul and level design is pain in the ass for me because I'm completely new to this. I managed to create 3 of them but these took me more than the time I rewrote the code and changed all assets. You can add more levels, change the game's name and publish it if you want\u00a0as long as you credit me. Anyways have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Github:</strong>\u00a0https://github.com/UnioDex/SuicideMission<br/><strong>Trello:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>https://trello.com/b/KqICMpvA/suicide-mission-game-board</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/02723ddd16262fea6cc4fab3ebd4422a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["YigitDuman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
