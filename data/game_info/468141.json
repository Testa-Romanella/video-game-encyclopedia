Middle Click or Shift+Click somewhere to try and start a fire. Other controls should appear in the game window (Backspace to show and hide the UI). Remember that you can click the button in the bottom right to go full screen if you want to see more.</p>\n<p>If you want an Out-of-Control inferno, it's exceptionally easy to do by finding a cluster of dried twigs and setting them ablaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This simulation models heat (the tiles tint colors based on how hot the tile is), moisture (flooded tiles are harder to set alight, but too much heat can easily dry up a tile), fuel, and flammability (wooden trees provide a lot more burn time, but are harder to set alight than dried twigs). I make no claims that this is an entirely accurate simulation: I basically spent most of the Game Jam playing with and tweaking rules and thresholds.</p>\n<p>This toy inspired by GMTK2020's theme: Out of Control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7cc1de5629dc7820d9c8b015cc9311c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tustin2121"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
