I'm actively updating the game to make it less of a demo and more of a full game :)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you add support for more platforms?</strong></p>\n<p><em>A: I will try my best to add support for mac and linux, maybe a demo for webgl but that's about it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does \"you got caught\" mean?</strong></p>\n<p><em>A: You died to a laser or camera after tripping the sound system.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: ... well how do I not get caught?</strong></p>\n<p><em>A: Don't flip \"reality locks\" (just the yellow switches) while you are moving or jumping. Also don't jump too often unless you have stacked many bandages.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does \"god wasnt on your side\" mean?</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>A: You lost the exit/winning gamble (that's why you flip more reality locks, make the door anomaly more unstable).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: The lights went out... what do I do?</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>A: Find a transformer box on a wall and turn them back on.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I get more time?</strong></p>\n<p><em>A: Memorize your route and switch placement to optimize time usage. Or just click f to convert a bandage into health at the cost of making more sound.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the glowing liquid?</strong></p>\n<p><em>A:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will you update the game?</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>A: Well...
