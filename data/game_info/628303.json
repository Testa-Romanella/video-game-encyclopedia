I took a lot of inspiration from books that I've enjoyed, writers that have moved me and my biggest aim for this project was to maybe move, however tiny the distance, someone else.</p>\n<p>Solo building this project from the ground up taught me an incredible amount and I hope to one day return to this piece to fix all the flaws and build upon it even more.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking it out\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T07:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/deb05d87e365359f01152f9f2124314b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wolfguts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
