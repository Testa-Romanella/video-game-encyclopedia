Find all 8 Crystal Cores to fix reality. Travel between 3 parallel universes all with unique properties and create your own portals for reality bending results by combining the properties of different realities.</p>\n\n<p>-Story-</p>\n<p>After an experiment gone wrong, you find yourself in the middle of a multiversal\u00a0 catastrophe. Portal to other parallel realities are appearing and you need to stop it. The 8 Core Crystals from you machine have been scattered between realities, find them, and you can fix the universe.</p>\n<p>You've also developed a technology that allows you to create portals into other realities, allow you to use the abilities from one reality in another.</p>\n\n<p>-Gameplay-</p>\n<p>This is mostly an action platformer with a hint of puzzle solving. Each universe has their own set of platforming physics, attacks and enemies.\u00a0 Understanding all of these is the key to find all the core crystals. You can use portals to take advantage of abilities outside of the one you are in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can collect red fragments and yellow tokens as well. Red fragments are scattered about and are dropped by enemies. Each 15 fragments you obtain gives you another heart. Similarly, there are 10 yellow tokens to find. They are tucked away in hard to reach area and some require some reality bending tricks to reach (as a tip, by timing switch into different realities correctly, you can gain insane air time)</p>\n\n<p>-Controls-</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>1-3 - Select Portal Type (once unlocked by finding each phone)</p>\n<p>Left\u00a0Click Mouse - Attack</p>\n<p>Right Click Mouse - Create Portal (as selected)</p>\n\n<p>-Credits-</p>\n<p>Created by Soltairus</p>\n<p>Made in GameMaker Studio 1.4</p>\n<p>Programming, Concept, and general development by Soltairus.</p>\n\n<p>-Pre-Made Assets by-</p>\n<p>Shackhal (https://shackhal.itch.io/multi-platformer-tileset)</p>\n<p>LYASeeK (https://lyaseek.itch.io/minifundead, https://lyaseek.itch.io/minifhumans,\u00a0https://lyaseek.itch.io/miniforcs)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Retrocade Media (https://retrocademedia.itch.io/buttonprompts4)</p>\n<p>Samuel Sousa (https://samuelsousa.itch.io/pixel-64)</p>\n<p>Niall Chandler\u00a0(https://niall-chandler-games.itch.io/8)</p>\n<p>Void (https://arcade.itch.io/1980)</p>\n<p>Bit by Bit Sound (Unlisted in game by mistake, https://bit-by-bit-sound.itch.io/8-bit-music-booster-pack)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Kenney\u00a0(Unlisted in game by mistake, https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T08:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/0026bf376f04a52cee33f736a7a53ca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soltairus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
