You have a shield and an afterburner, but both consume a lot of energy, so you can only use them in carefully timed bursts.</li><li>Grab various weapon upgrades and nuclear missiles.</li><li>Find the alien saucers that are directing the stream of asteroids and engage them in combat. They're quite tricky and will dodge in and out of range.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/4442b525095eb0670c27e609eded694d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zarkonnen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
