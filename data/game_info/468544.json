The secluded frog kingdom, better known as the Anura Duchy in the magical sector, have enlisted Treyton and co. to seek out a red-skinned creature that is said to devour its victims whole before regurgitating them. According to the group's research based on reports from their guide, Briar, their target is none other than the fabled yara-ma-yha-who. Treyton insists on traveling in the forest alone in order to goad the creature out of hiding and confront it despite his compatriots\u2019 apprehensive objections. Although they wish to protect him from falling into darkness, the boy misinterprets their disagreements as condescending and becomes increasingly stubborn as a result. He leaves the rest of the group behind and ventures deep into the swamp that the Anura Duchy calls home. Will Treyton be able to prove he is self-sufficient by feign vulnerability or will his pigheaded mindset cause him to be the yara-ma-yha-who\u2019s next victim as his compatriots feared?
