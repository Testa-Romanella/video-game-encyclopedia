Watch out for the quicksand, as it immediately resets you to your former position. Par for the course is 40.\u00a0</p>\n<p>pro tip: power 1-5 is for getting the ball in the hole,\u00a0 5-15 is for getting in the proximity, and I don't know what you're trying if you pick over 20 power.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>UP/DOWN arrowkeys or W/S to increase and decrease shot power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SPACE or LMB to launch/shoot.</p>\n\n<p>All sounds are from Freesounds.org, but all art and code is by me.
