You get a choice of three dice every few seconds.\u00a0Stop the chess pieces before they reach your castle. WASD to move and Space to jump.\u00a0Once a dice lands, it deals AoE\u00a0damage equal to the number that is face up.\u00a0Blue dice fire 2x as fast, dice with red dots\u00a0deal 2x damage. Spell dice can cast\u00a0either a fire explosion that does high damage or freeze spell that stops\u00a0enemy movement.\u00a0Note: the hitboxes for the AoE effects are a fair bit\u00a0smaller than the vfx make them seem...</p>\n<p><strong>Made by AshenDisc and MrSquish.</strong></p>\n<p>PS. Sorry about the camera bugging out sometimes. It is only an issue with the WebGL build, and I could not figure out why... :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90158419e3cc14c68018ab39edd56f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrSquish"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
