{"id": 741624, "slug": "the-drop-2012", "name": "The Drop (2012)", "name_original": "The Drop (2012)", "description": "<p>-The Drop is a unique take on the dungeon crawler and follow-up to 2009&#39;s The Reconstruction.<br />\n-No typical HP &amp; MP monotony. Instead, player and enemy alike have Body, Mind, and Soul ratings which serve as both health and magical power. Knocking any of these to zero means defeat, so spelunkers beware!<br />\n-Create your own player character. Choose a race, appearance, starting weapon, elemental alignment, perks, and a background. Or, choose from an array of pre-made characters, including a few familiar faces.<br />\n-Randomized dungeons. Hundreds of items, dozens of monsters and spells, and all sorts of weirdness lurks around every corner!<br />\n-Use magic and items to manipulate the environment to your advantage. Freeze water to trap foes in place. Set fire to grass to create a smokescreen. Evaporate spilled poison to create a toxic cloud. Electrify puddles of water. Many interactions await!<br />\n-Exploit your enemies&#39; fears and emotions. Lull, befriend, or terrorize enemies by using the proper item or spell!<br />\n-Experiment with items to discover their properties with interactions like eating, applying, and throwing. A plant that makes you sick when eaten may have healing properties when applied to your wounds instead. Collect them all!<br />\n-Use stealth and line-of-sight to your advantage. Sneak up on enemies to attack from behind, or avoid them entirely. But be careful - enemies you can&#39;t see can do the same to you!<br />\n-Customizable BGM playlist. Add or remove songs from the dungeon&#39;s soundtrack, or even import your own music!<br />\n-Hardcore mode awaits! A true roguelike experience with permanent death and limited saving available. Do you feel lucky?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T02:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2a3e38a6861b916d0cb5c26086ea741.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/4395/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
