At the bottom of the game is a control bar.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are the topmost basilisk. The default is for your opponent to be played by the computer, but you can press on the head of the opposing basilisk, before you take your first move, to play the two player version.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can move one cell at a time by pressing the arrow buttons on the control bar, by using the arrow buttons on a keyboard, by clicking on, or touching, an adjacent cell to that of your snake head or by pressing on the edge of the board of the direction you wish to go.\r\n</p>\n<p>If the adjacent cell to you has a grey, unused body section the basilisk will slither along it to the next free cell, which you can also click on or touch.\r\n</p>\n<p>Players alternate moves. Only one basilisk will survive. If the head of one basilisk lands on the head of the other, it kills its opponent. If one basilisk has no further space to move in, it dies.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game can be played on any platform, online, at https://basilisk.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e68b20c2f25af1c6bb71dea856574183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nicoatridge"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
