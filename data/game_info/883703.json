Leading to the creation of many things, one of which being the Union Of Mages.</p>\n<p>The year is 1513, the relations between Lingard's two biggest kingdoms (Veskallia and Cornell) are\u00a0stressed, now the world waits for the next war to begin. In order to relieve some fear that the citizens feel, the Union Of Mages has decided to continue with the annual Battle mage tournament, where the highest ranking students across the world are brought together to see who is more skilled in their element.</p>\n<p>You are one of those students, on their way to the event. The first step is to get to Hamrar, meet a friend, who was also selected for the event as well, and then make your way to the capital. Hopefully there isn't any danger along the way.</p>\n\n<p>\"...Can...hear...? ...have...tell you...days left...next cy-\"</p>\r\nControl Types\r\n<ul><li>Keyboard and Mouse</li><li>Controller</li></ul>\r\nAdditional Notes\r\n<p>Please let me know if you find any issues while playing the game.
