There's good news and bad news... The good news is you were locked in a bakery, so you have all the bread in the world to eat. The bad news is you have a gluten allergy...\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created over two weeks\u00a0for My First Game Jam: Summer 2021 event.\u00a0 In this game, the player must do their best to find scraps of bread in order to not die from hunger. The theme of this game jam was \"free\". One of the first phrases we came up with was \"gluten-free\". And the thought of being locked in a bakery while having a fatal gluten allergy was really funny to our group so we simply built upon that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming + Design:\u00a0 jteaaa#8556 on Discord</p>\n<p>Player Art: @sol.artis on Instagram<br/></p>\n<p>Environment and UI Art: Irmak\u00a0Cavun\u00a0(website: https://irmakcavun.com/),\u00a0nannerbel#7777</p>\n<p>Additional\u00a0Art:\u00a0 Snowy_Oshawott#7640 on Discord</p>\n<p>Sounds + Music:\u00a0@HerpDerpPurp on Twitter</p>\n<p>Music: Charteeguh on Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/artist/0YJ4NWwnWGQaZTgl0YMCBP?si=jdnuukaoRRyFqv7cuP0ezA&amp;dl_branch=1)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/207ece5d6434ba90bbeccea7bfdd8e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jteaaa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
