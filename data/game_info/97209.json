You're Glasses, just some nerdy bro with noble goals - as noble as an evil genius manages, at least. What else can you do but pick up all the pieces and try again? On your journey, you'll learn how to scientifically approach stuff like magnets, robots, sticks and daddy issues. We'll all learn so much together and have a super good time overall!</p><p>Explore your crash-landed base, visit Cyclopia and its strange residents and try to get your crossworld puzzle helper robot to stop trying to dissect your brain.
