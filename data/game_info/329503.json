{"id": 329503, "slug": "viv-and-bob", "name": "Viv and Bob", "name_original": "Viv and Bob", "description": "<p>On a sunny day, Lil Viv and her Uncle Bob visited the forest, where Viv saw a mysterious mansion. Not thinking twice, she went into the abandoned house before Bob could even try to stop her. Standing in the hallway, the floor under their feet suddenly broke down. Viv and Bob fell into the basement, not knowing what will happen next.</p>\n<p><strong>Viv and Bob </strong>is a puzzle game made with GB Studio 1.1 where you play Viv and Bob, trying to exit the many rooms of the mansion's basement. While Bob is strong enough to push blocks to their designated places, Lil Viv is light enough to walk above insecure parts of the floor. Bob and Viv are trapped in two sides of a mirror. The room Bob is standing in is a mirrored version of Viv's room and vice versa. Actions on one side of the mirror affect the other side as well. Switch between both protagonists and always think about both sides of the mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a game for the original Game Boy. The download contains a Game Boy ROM.\u00a0</strong>The ROM can be played on emulators or even a real Game Boy if you are using a flashcart. <br/></p>\n<p>The current Version 1.0 of the game contains a set of levels. I will try to add more levels with Version 1.1. Moreover I will try to add some cutscenes and a animated prologue and epilouge. Obviously I will also fix bugs if I find them.</p>\n<p>English is not my native language. If you find any text errors in my game, please let me know so I can fix them.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy my little game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9d109b7baab01fb4bb499e28cc5d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Impergatox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
