It was built from the ground up to empower anyone to create fully immersive concept sketches in VR from inside your headset. Maquette includes a set of tools for importing, creating, composing, and storyboarding content in 3D space, complete with a library of primitives and UI icons. Among many other features, Maquette has fast and approachable UX, a text tool for annotations and spatial UI mockups, and easy selection and nested-grouping of content. Maquette has a complimentary Unity addon for importing Maquette content into Unity, which preserves materials and grouping hierarchy. Maquette's development process is guided by users' needs, so we want your feedback!\ufeff<br/><br/><strong>Maquette's Website</strong><br/>http://www.maquette.ms<br/><br/><strong>Feedback Hub</strong><br/>https://support.maquette.ms/hc/en-us/community/topics<br/><br/><strong>Bringing Maquette Content into Unity</strong><br/>https://www.maquette.ms/unity-addon", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c46/c46095e6535eea0ef62ff41bd96dac56.jpg", "website": "https://www.maquette.ms", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 168, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Microsoft"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
