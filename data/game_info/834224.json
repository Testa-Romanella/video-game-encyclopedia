It was Funshckin's second attempt at rivaling Nintendo's strategy of transitioning from a toy manufacture to a game developer. The Funshckin 84' directly competed with Nintendo's Game &amp; Watch system and Ronnie's Pizza was a hit for the pocket device.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>In 1952 Ronnie Pots opened Ronnie's Pizza, a small mom and pop pizza establishment located in Balsam Hill. As soon as his restaurant opened it was a giant success, with pizzas going to hungry mouths by the minute. Realizing\u00a0 that Ronnie couldn't manage the rush on his owned, his son, Ronnie Pots Jr. decided to help his Dad and deliver delicious pizza to the customers of Balsam Hill. Will you be able to help the Ronnie Pots duo take on the challenge of looming customers?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin the game, simply press A for Game A or B for Game B. Once the game begins, move Ronnie Pots Jr. with the D-PAD in the direction that you wish to go. When you aren't holding a pizza you can pick one up at a table by pressing A and then move to your desired table and press A again to place it. The B button acts as a quick step to the opposite direction for faster movement.\u00a0<em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>UP</em></strong>\u00a0= ARROW UP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>DOWN</em></strong>\u00a0= ARROW DOWN\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>LEFT</em></strong>= ARROW LEFT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>RIGHT</em></strong>\u00a0= ARROW RIGHT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>A</em></strong>= Z\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>B</em></strong>= X\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>START</em></strong>= ENTER\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>SELECT</em></strong>= SELECT</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Game A</strong></p>\n<p>In Game A, customers will appear from the left, bottom, and right sides of the screen one at a time.
