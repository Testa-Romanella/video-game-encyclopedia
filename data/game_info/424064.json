{"id": 424064, "slug": "magneko", "name": "Magneko (itch)", "name_original": "Magneko (itch)", "description": "Game Outline\r\n<p>Magneko is a two-player physics-based puzzle game with a focus on teamwork and cooperation. Each of the two players can harness the magnetic powers of either attraction or repulsion. Using these magnetic burst and beam abilities, players need to be methodical in order to progress through the levels. Although there is platforming, the puzzles mainly rely on the players using their magnetic abilities to interact with each other and objects in the game-world.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Benjamin Vernon - Producer, Game Design, UI Artist &amp; Programmer</p>\n<p>Hai Li - Character Design Artist, Animator, Background Artist, Level Design</p>\n<p>Willie Kirby -\u00a0Programming Lead, Mechanic Design, GIT IT</p>\n<p>Nolan Ollada - Level Design Lead, Sound Lead, Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Ari Sharfstein - Music<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>PS4 DualShock 4 controller</p>\n<ul><li>D-pad and Left Stick: character movement</li><li>Right stick: Aim beam</li><li>Left trigger: Magnetic burst</li><li>Right trigger: Magnetic beam</li><li>X button and right bumper: Jump</li><li>Square button: Hold to enable free camera</li><li>Triangle button: Reset level</li><li>Circle button: Slow move</li><li>Start button: Pause</li></ul>\r\nStory\r\n<p>A mad scientist has been experimenting with creating magnetic-cat hybrids. Knife is one of these experiments. The laboratory's robo-cat caretaker, Refrigerator, sees his master\u2019s cruelty and frees Knife from her incubating tank. After trying to escape the lab, they fall down a trash chute into the Earth\u2019s core. Both Knife and Fridge must use teamwork and their magnetic abilities to climb back up the surface.</p>\r\nUnique Features\r\n<ul><li>Magnetic-based player and world interactions</li><li>Cooperative, physics-based puzzles</li><li>One player has magnetic attraction beam and burst ability</li><li>One player has magnetic repulsion beam and burst ability</li><li>Four worlds with unique art and music</li><li>35+ levels</li></ul>\r\nDevelopment Status\r\n<p>This project is still in development.
