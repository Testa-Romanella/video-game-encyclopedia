In this incredibly short game, you must go around town doing errands for the townsfolk to get the art supplies you need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WASD / Left stick to move</li>\n<li>E / A (Xbox) to interact</li>\n<li>F / Select to toggle fullscreen  </li>\n<li>Hover near NPCs to talk with them</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Project Context</strong>\n<p>This solo project was originally meant for the Weekly Game Jam 272: Painting. Although I practically finished in time for submission, I caused game-breaking dependency issues on the day of the submission and the only way of fixing them was a long and manual process. Because of this, it has taken me more than a month to pick the project up again and fix the issues. Never again will I work without version control from Git.</p>\n<p>I also took the time afterwards to add SFX which I didn't originally have, but I didn't want to alter the project too much otherwise. If I had more time, there would be more actual gameplay, more errands, and there would be many more NPCs that would spontaneously interact with each other. Despite being very lazy with dialogue writing, I spent a very significant amount of time on the dialogue system. As is my custom, I expected to get much more done in the game jam's time frame than I actually could.</p>\r\n(Characters that I planned, most of whom I never had the time to animate.)\r\n<strong>Asset credits:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arkeve (itch.io):</strong> Slime (modified)</li>\n<li><strong>Diogo Vernier (itch.io):</strong>\u00a0House exterior tileset (modified)</li>\n<li><strong>Diogo Vernier (itch.io):</strong>\u00a0Fence (modified)</li>\n<li><strong>Zapsplat:</strong> Music (<em>Make It Snappy</em>, Dramatic loop)</li>\n<li><strong>Zapsplat</strong>: Ambient noise</li>\n<li><strong>Youtube (Audio Library):</strong> Non-retro SFX</li>\n<li><strong>Font:</strong> <em>Press Start</em> - Cody Bosclair (Dafont)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other SFX is created in BFXR and other art and animation created in Asesprite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T16:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e93519673bda20c49826891434b64d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["KingPiEta"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
