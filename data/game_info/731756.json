It is not white or black, but not just any other color either. Worlds at all scales have their own duality and cannot be seen only from one side. It is no different even in the world of bugs. In the world, every element is both good and bad. Good for some and bad for others, yet each of them is bad for the world and good for the world as a whole. You are the bug, and your job is in the fight - fight against the evil. But... Who is evil? Other bugs? Game draws from the genre of late twentieth century fighting games and adds a flash game theme to it.
