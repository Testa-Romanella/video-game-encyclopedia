It is designed to be played with friends in a group.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer will not work in this game without steam running in the background!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>To start a round</p>\n<p>1. A player will have to host a game</p>\n<p>2. Once people join (Via the in-game browser), the host needs to drive into the \"Touch to start\" area of the lobby level.</p>\n<p>This is a standard line bike game. Every player moves forward at the same speed and deploys walls behind them. Touching ANY wall will blow up the player that hits it. Use boost to gain an edge against your opponents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can set your color in the menu!</p>\n\n<p>Note: <strong>Steam invites do not work yet.</strong></p>\n<p>It will also show up as \"spacegame\" that is the default dev game for steam.</p>\n<p>This is an alpha, The end game doesn't have a scoreboard to view, But it does track wins.</p>\n<p>I'm unsure If I\u00a0plan to continue this game. If people like it, I\u00a0would be happy to keep developing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also there are some bugs I\u00a0know about that I haven't gone into tackling. Like,</p>\n<p>1. alt-tabbing causes that players wall to pause. Not game breaking. I\u00a0assume I just need to make that code run on the server/host.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Joining a lobby may cause 2 of you to show up (1 won't move). I\u00a0know what causes it. I\u00a0just haven't fixed it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e8541b4a37c15a2cfc0c2b9ae69819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["icefire555"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
