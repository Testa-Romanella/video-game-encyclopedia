The player controls a small and sentient trash-can robot known as Gomi, which was sent to the junkyard to be recycled into scrap. Gomi chances upon a Grappling Hook, giving it a chance to escape the junkyard.<br/></p>\n<p>The player\u2019s goal is to help Gomi safely manoeuvre its way through several consecutive levels of increasing difficulty. The game ends when the player successfully clears all of these levels. It is possible for Gomi to \u201cdie\u201d in any of the levels, but Gomi can be respawned and the current level will get reset.</p>\n<p>Gomi Gomi appeals to players who enjoy platforming games that provide a sense of progression and mastery of a core mechanic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:40:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e7/9e70cdf94b1272bf8e049ea7bc8090c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gruntbrina"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
