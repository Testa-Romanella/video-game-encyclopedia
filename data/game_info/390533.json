{"id": 390533, "slug": "drakewars", "name": "DrakeWars", "name_original": "DrakeWars", "description": "<p>Welcome to Drakewars - the first free-to-play strategy collection game where YOU own everything in it. Here\u2019s a few things you should know before you get started.</p>\n<p>First-up, all content is player-owned. Most games have a closed, managed economy. You put in time and money, and you play within the system. You have some fun, but the developers control everything in it.</p>\n<p>In Drakewars - everything you build, develop, evolve, and battle is YOURS - not ours. You can keep it, you can customize it, you can give it away, or you can take it out of the game into the real world. It\u2019s your property - and you can do whatever you want with it.</p>\n<p>Next - at its heart, DrakeWars is an economic strategy game. You can breed, evolve, and customize dragons through careful strategy and management - but you\u2019re the one designing all the content. </p>\n<p>Finally - this game is all about unlimited customization. We\u2019re talking MASSIVE- with over 1 billion possible Dragon builds. When you take those Dragons into the PVP Arena against other players - that\u2019s over quadrillion ways to win (or lose!)</p>\n<p>So, if you love a good challenge and like to keep what you play - welcome to DrakeWars. You\u2019re in the right place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-13T21:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8509fe53e36078a203b6877de107f1.jpg", "website": "https://drakewars.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
