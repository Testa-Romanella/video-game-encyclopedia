Scramble to catch beans that fall from \n      the sky, racking up points as you go. The farther away the bean, the \n      more points it\u2019s worth. Beware any beans that are missed, though\u2014they \n      will leave a hole in the ground that can\u2019t be crossed, potentially \n      trapping Pyoro. Bird &amp; Beans also features a second version that enables \n      Pyoro to spit seeds at high speed, bringing down more beans than ever \n      before. This fun and fast-paced game requires skill and strategy to \n      master and always leaves you wanting to play just one more time\u2026\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T06:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/1070d0c7fc998a4790fd11594f5ba028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
