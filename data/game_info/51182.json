Beware, there are many dangers on the islands. <br/>\r\nBuild, explore, and survive.<br/>\r\nThe world of the game is quite vast. A few islands surrounding the beginning, including those that are extremely unfriendly to you, but with some benefits that you will not find on others. <br/>\r\nNot every plant and every animal is positive towards you.<br/>\r\nYour statistics are growing by practice. The more often we cut a tree, the faster we cut it. The more often we receive injuries, the more we become resistant to them over time. Animals and \"Others\" also have such a possibility.
