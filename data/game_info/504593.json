A seemingly simple level can turn into the most complex puzzle when you start to see things you missed before.\u00a0There are no instructions aside from (some!) initial controls (WASD). Everything else about the game must be learned through experimentation.</p>\n<p>Hints if you are stuck:</p>\n<p>HINT 1</p>\n\n<p>HINT 2</p>\n<p>HINT 3</p>\n<p>The hints are for the beginning puzzles in case the mechanics of the game are not clear. There are a total of 12 endings. Every puzzle can be solved and a few have more than one ending.</p>\n<p>Character Animation:<br/></p>\n<p>Stacy Kendra Love &amp; Ahmet Avci Narcissist Interactive</p>\n\n<p>Sound Credits:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/thom_cookes/</p>\n<p>Astounded</p>\n<p>Christopher J Astbury</p>\n<p>Switzerland</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Astounded/</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Metzik/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ssaada1/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/nirmatara/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:49:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b4075e8843879c6151374fe1837e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["natethegreat2525"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
