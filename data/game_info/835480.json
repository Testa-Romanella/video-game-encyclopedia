While a unit is selected left click on a highlighted tile to move or a targeted enemy to attack. Each unit can attack once per turn. Click the button in the bottom right to end your turn.</p>\n<p>You will get a randomized party of adventurers.\u00a0The goal is to get as deep into the dungeon as you can. The three classes of adventurers are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Paladin\u00a0</strong>who full heals at the end of every turn</li><li><strong>Archer\u00a0</strong>who has long range attacks</li><li><strong>Wizard\u00a0</strong>whose attacks chain to the sides and up and down</li></ul>\n<p>Between each fight you will be given two items to choose from. You can equip these on any of your heroes. They give boosts to the following stats:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 Damage\u00a0</strong>how many HP of damage they do with an attack</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0Health\u00a0</strong>how much damage they can take before death</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0Movement\u00a0</strong>how far they can move</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0Range\u00a0</strong>how far away they can attack</p>\n<p>As you get lower the items you get will become stronger but so will the monsters! Good luck!</p>\n<p>The current lowest depth we have gotten to is 9. Let us know if you beat that and what party/items you had!</p>\n\n<p><strong>There Are Bugs!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is plenty of wonky janky stuff going on. If you run into an issue leave a comment. Particularly anything to do with necromancer/wizard interactions can be... strange. But such is the nature of magic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Liam Dyer - Programming, Art, Music</p>\n<p>Matt Miller - Programming, Art</p>\n<p>Jacob Dyer - Design, Playtesting</p>\n<p>Dave Hammarstedt - Programming, Design, Playtesting</p>\n<p>Dungeon\u00a0Tileset a recolor of\u00a0Minifantasy Dungeon\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game is\u00a0open source</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T08:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/785/785820ba24df0ebacdf7cc9119c91cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Renosance Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
