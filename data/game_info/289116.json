She has too much gold and adventurers are trying to get it! Help Delores protect her home from the advancing Knights of Flat led by the infamous Harriet the Hero.\u00a0</p><p>How to play: Use your HTC Vive Controllers or Microsoft Mixed Reality inside-out tracking (without the HMD!) to control each character (left is Hero, right is Dragon). Hero can use her sword to stab the dragon while dragon fights back with claws, teeth, and tail. If hurt, that character is paused giving the other time to pick up a gold coin. When all the coins are gone, the game is over and a winner is reported.
