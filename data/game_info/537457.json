This game shares that story. (Company name changed for parody purposes.) It was one of the moments that changed the course of my life forever. Run the game to see that moment...</p>\n<p>As for the game:</p>\n<p>WHO STOLE THE COAL?</p>\n\n<p>Santa got home and found no coal for his furnace! His house is cold. He hear whispers that the Abominable Snowbeast took all nine of his coal chunks, along with nine of his elves, and SIXTY of his cookies! Fortunately, the Abominable Snowbeast sleeps at sunset, so Santa can sneak in and get his coal back!</p>\n\n<p>Santa can't heat his house tonight without at least FOUR COAL. Get four coal and return to Santa's House to win! (Then press then X+O buttons to see how you did!)</p>\n<p>AND FOR THE BRAVE: get ALL NINE coal, rescue all NINE elves, and collect SIXTY COOKIES for a perfect win!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS\r\nArrows to move.\r\nX to swing your CaneMaul to break boulders.</p>\n<p>TIPS</p>\n<ul><li>Look out for secrets!
