But, dear Adventure Gamer, fear nothing! Despite the seemingly gloomy setting, the game doesn't intend to get you down, as its main goal is to poke fun at many absurdities of the daily life in a totalitarian-communist state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will feature a whole variety of puzzles, which, unlike the state of Absurdistan, do make sense. Some of them may even require you to grab something to write and figure them out in real life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Manual:</strong><br/>You control Leszek with the mouse and occasionally with the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Left mouse click is used to BOTH inspect and interact with objects/hotspots/characters.</p>\n<p>Right mouse click is used only to click out of GUIs, interfaces or deselect active inventory items.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/180c8bc803d35a878aab3d1b4be81b7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazy Squirrel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
