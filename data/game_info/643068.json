Increase your score by delivering the requested sandwiches to the food delivery people. The game ends when you run out of lives, you lose a life every time you don't deliver the sides and the sandwich\u00a0in time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Look at a food delivery person to see their requested order. A typical order will look something like this:</p>\n<ul><li>Sandwich<ul><li>Bread</li></ul><ul><li>Bacon</li></ul><ul><li>Lettuce</li></ul><ul><li>Tomato</li></ul><ul><li>Bread</li></ul></li><li>Side<ul><li>French Fries</li><li>Cookies</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>The order of the ingredients matters.\u00a0</strong>Sides should be stacked too (like a french-fry cookie sandwich). Delivering either a side or a sandwich will reset the delivery person's 60 second timer.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Left click to pick up sandwich pieces and stack them together</li><li>Press E to toss the currently held sandwich</li><li>Right click to drop the held sandwich</li><li>Shift to sprint</li><li>WASD to move</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>Esc to hide/unhide mouse cursor (doesn't work for web because I forgot that web browsers use this to unhide the cursor)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Download the Windows build for the best experience\u00a0(the mouse sensitivity is lower (I didn't have a lot of time to test the web build haha), and performance is better, especially in\u00a0fullscreen).</strong><br/></p>\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<ul><li>Mouse sensitivity is too high on WebGL builds for some reason</li><li>Selected ingredient highlight doesn't work consistently (it did in the editor)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453271d9e52b35b7aaa2b8ccc4be8666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lightning_A"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
