The goal was to use the reconverging plot to\u00a0create the illusion of choice while not actually including any \"real\" choices. The game only progresses in one way, and just like in real life, time only moves quickly when you don't want it to, and sometime's it's just impossible to tear yourself away from certain \"unproductive\" tasks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61b/61bd58c5169751285b40b9ce739ef6bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ana"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
