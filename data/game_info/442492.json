As game is non linear you will probably only see 10-15 in a playthrough though.<br/>-All actions you take get saved, some decisions are available only because of your past decisions.<br/>-The story, engine and music is made by us in vscode and Ableton. Some libraries were used for sound.</p>\n<p>We have a 150 event story prepared, if you like the game provide your feedback and we will try to finish it!</p>\n<p>It has been a really cool but demanding project as it is literaly our first game, surely not the last one!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing\u00a0</p><p>Uploads:</p><p>--Updated missing strings in events.json.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d04c7b26ffb35d893cae7d8acaf466d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angelo12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
