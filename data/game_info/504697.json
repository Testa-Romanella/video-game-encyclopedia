Try to catch your ghost from your previous round before it can escape, and then escape yourself. The ghost will follow the same path you took, even traveling through walls that weren't there before. You'll need to think quickly and have a good memory in order to catch it.</p>\n<p>Use W, A, S, and D to move.
