She does have the unique ability to decelerate time momentarily, allowing for precise jumps, dodges, and attacks, turning imminent failures into triumphant successes.<br/><br/>The story, told in 5 colors and well over <strong>100 pixels</strong> per scanline, guides the player through 3 worlds and 20+ levels. Join DUCK in an adventure where every pixel counts!<h3>Rescue your friends!</h3><br/>Your friends have been captured and are imprisoned within cages scattered throughout the game. Leap on top the cages to destroy them and set your friends free!<h3>Timewarp</h3> <br/>Save-up warp pellets and enable timewarp to dodge enemy attacks or surprise your enemies with a burst of rapid-fire bullets. You can find these pellets throughout the levels and enemies will usually drop some when they're destroyed.<h3>Enemies</h3><br/>You'll encounter a diverse array of adversaries, each presenting unique challenges. There are some that soar through the skies, others that slither close to the ground and attack at a moments notice. And some simply.. walk.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T07:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/842f54bbcc63c6faac33cbd3665f262b.jpg", "website": "https://www.amostterribleday.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Armand Niehaus"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Armand Niehaus"], "esrb_rating": null}
