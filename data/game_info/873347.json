I already had made a very basic prototype a few years ago but the car physics was awful, it didn't work on mobile, and it didn't have leaderboards. So I decided the rewrite it from scratch, fix all those issues, and add more features.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My initial goal was way more ambitious than what I ended up submitting. I wanted to have procedurally generated tracks, several locations, and car customization. However, for personal reasons I didn't have as much time as I expected, so I had to cut a lot of that stuff and ended up settling for a single handmade track and a single car with no customization. Being realistic though,\u00a0even with the full two weeks I probably wouldn't be able to meet my goals anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite my unreasonable expectations, I'm happy with the results and I had a lot of fun working on this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming by Ricardo Moran</li><li>Music:\u00a0HexaPuppies Synthwave 80s Retro Music Pack\u00a0by DavidKBD<br/>\n</li><li>Countdown\u00a0SFX:\u00a0Countdown by\u00a0Destructavator</li><li>Engine SFX:\u00a0Car Engine Loop by\u00a0qubodup</li><li>New record SFX:\u00a0Ta Da!\u00a0by Mike Koenig\r\n</li><li>Fonts:\u00a0CATV 6X12 9\u00a0by HolyBlackCat<br/>\n</li><li>Fonts:\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0by Tony de Marco and Monica Rizzolli\r\n</li><li>Fonts:\u00a0UniCons\u00a0by\u00a0Juergen Krausz\r\n</li><li>Fonts:\u00a0Super Mario 256 by\u00a0fsuarez913</li><li>Onscreen Controls by\u00a0Kenney</li><li>UI Theme:\u00a0Kenney's UI Theme by azagaya\u00a0(and Kenney)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T07:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf5420e56a02e37d8e82001bbc723839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Richo"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
