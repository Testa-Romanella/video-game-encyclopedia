Hut hut hut\u2026\u201d Nintendo takes to the gridiron with the classic \n      football powerhouse NES Play Action Football. Featuring a distinct \n      overhead viewpoint that creates an almost 3-D field, the action is more \n      simulation based than many of the more arcade-based games of the time. \n      Play through four 15-minute quarters (in accelerated time) and even \n      substitute players when your first stringers get tired! Want more \n      options? Each of the eight available teams has multiple running/passing \n      plays to choose from while on offense, as well as a wide selection of \n      defensive schemes that can be run when you\u2019re on the other side of the \n      ball. And in addition to viewing two full teams on-screen at once \n      without any slowdown, you\u2019ll hear voice snippets at key points of the \n      game. Line up, and see if you have what it takes to win the Power Bowl!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d3c61ac6ef59bb91c73b87be200bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES", "Game Boy", "Wii"], "developers": ["Tose", "Tose Co."], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
