This means it will open a terminal window and you need to type stuff to play. Very old school :)</p>If you play on Windows, I recommend installing this terminal https://cmder.net/ (default one has some problems with charset or something).\n<p>This game is under development and it's made with Rust. It's kind of a <em>demake</em> of a\u00a0 game I had previosuly made with JavaScript, that you can play here. The reason I started working on this was to learn Rust, but I like it so much that it might become the <em>official</em> version of Live and end up having more features.</p><p>If you are curious you can check out the code here.</p><p>If you run into any issue, please comment here or let me know via twitter or github. I can't promise any fixes, especially on Windows platform as I have no way to test it, but I'll do my best! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T07:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cec4ebb4626cda9824c252b635bb1f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nuria"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
