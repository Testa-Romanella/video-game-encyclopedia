Press space to JUMP and try to get on the next platform!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>And of course there are a few extras to make it more interesting:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>1. Coins</strong></em></p>\n<p>You can collect coins to buy some cool stuff in the shop.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>2. Four different Power-Ups</strong></em></p>\n<p>The green coin is actually a Power-Up. When you collect it, you get one of four by random, to spice the game up a bit. One will make you tall, another one will make you small. A tricky one turns you into sphere and the last one will make you bounce a bit every time you hit an edge.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>3. Shop with an extra</strong></em></p>\n<p>You can use the coins you collected to buy colors for your player! Even though there are 3 default colors to buy, the \"Create your own Color\" Section is much cooler. Using three sliders for R, G and B, you can make your own color. In theory, you can make more than 16 million colors with that!</p>\n\n<p><strong>And be careful:</strong> You can only jump when the cube is perfectly on the ground, so if it lands on the edge, you will have to wait until it falls over. To counter this problem, always jump at the right moment!\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Good luck and have fun while playing! :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What to do after installing:</strong></p>\n<p>You will get a\u00a0<strong>Zip-File</strong>\u00a0that you have to place in a folder you like.</p>\n<p>Then right click on it and\u00a0<strong>select \"Extract here\".</strong></p>\n<p>To start the game simply\u00a0<strong>double click on \"Jump.exe\".</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:51:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f031f923d1f2654cb350c5dda12924e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mh_tech"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
