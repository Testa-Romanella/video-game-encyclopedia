Care for  Bob (and his cat Bella) by keeping him fed and entertained by checking in on them regularly and making sure they have all the food, water and entertainment they need. Play games with Bob to help him earn more money to spend (but don't accidentally lose it!) as Bob only gets paid once every 7 of the real-time day/night cycles. When you're not curating Bob, let him entertain you as he plays piano, watches TV, listens to music or fastidiously does the housework against the background of gentle traffic sounds, soft rainfall and the mesmerising ticking of the clock. Don't like Bob's music? Then simply replace the files in the music folder with your own, and Bob will update his playlist. Don't leave him unattended for too long, however, lest the poor soul expires...</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Interact with the mouse to open the tabs at the side and top by clicking on them. The top tab provides Bob's current bank balance and a count down to next pay day. The left tab displays Bob's needs, and any messages he may send you when using the computer. Here he will let you know if he's running low on anything such as food or water. The right tab displays Bob's household essentials, which can be topped up by clicking the + sign next to each bar. When the mouse cursor hovers over a bar it will display how much that item costs. At the bottom of the tab an icon will display which activity Bob is thinking about. Each of these tabs can also be toggled via the left, right and up arrow keys.</p><p>Pressing Escape, Pause, P or Backspace opens the help overlay. Here the options menu can also be accessed, as well as the credits window. Pressing any one of the four keys again will close the overlay.<br/></p><p><em>Requirements:</em></p><p>OpenGL capable graphics card - has been tested to work with AMD, nVidia and Intel graphics cards.
