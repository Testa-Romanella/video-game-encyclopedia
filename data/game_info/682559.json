Something previously too heavy could now possibly be moved with 2 or 3 pod pairs. <br/>Maybe a door needs 1 pod pair to hold it\u00a0open but you needed a 2nd pod pair to pull something through it\u00a0etc</li></ul>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>- R key resets WHOLE game not the room, just FYI.<br/>- ESC to close game (there's no pause so be careful)<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Space to jump.<br/>- LMB to shoot a magnetic pod.<br/>- RMB (hold) to recall a specific pod pair (when aiming at a pod)<br/>- Shift + RMB recall all fired pods.<br/>- MMB / Mouse wheel button reverses magnetic polarity of pod pair you're aiming at.</p>\n<p>No fall damage or health.<br/>No crouch.<br/>No run.</p>\n<p>Known bugs/issues:\u00a0<br/>Player sometimes may get stuck on edges of objects &amp; unable to jump.
