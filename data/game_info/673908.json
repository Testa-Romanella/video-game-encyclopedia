If anyone is familiar with Ultima 7, one of the best RPG games ever made then would know what I am going to say next.\u00a0 I\u00a0have worked using Engine001, the most powerful game making tool, and easy to use at the sametime. With this tool I have made an Ultima 7 like style engine, but only have reached 70% so far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Here are the things I have done so far:</p>\n<ol><li>Completed identifying all objects and NPCs in the map.</li><li>Completed restriction where a person cannot pick an item if it is too heavy.</li><li>Completed restriction where a person cannot pick or use an item behind wall or door.</li><li>Implemented crafting system.</li><li>Completed ability to use items on map, inside containers on map, or containers inside containers on map or while picked up in inventory.</li><li>Completed inventory system.</li><li>Completed dialog box.</li><li>Implemented the layering system.</li><li>Completed the ability for roof to disappear or appear when entering or leaving house.</li><li>Implemented night/day cycle.</li><li>Implemented food system</li></ol>\n<p>Here are the things that have not been completed:</p>\n<ol><li>NPC scheduling</li><li>NPC crafting</li><li>Complete crafting sysem</li><li>Custom AI</li><li>Finish training system</li></ol>\n\n<p>This source code comes with custom graphics to start with in your project and get an idea of how the system and layering works. You need Engine001 to be able to open the source code and work on it. You can find Engine001 at http://engine001.com.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43b447a8b145054d6d790d02fb0e49b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xboxown"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
