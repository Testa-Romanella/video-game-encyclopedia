Only you can convince me that it is worth trying :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d30f1b6caf409cd19cfebdb5e6e3d494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImaginaryBlend"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
