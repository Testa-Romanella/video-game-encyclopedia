It can be considered &quot;Supraland 1.5&quot; because there are still a lot things from the first game, but at the same time it&#39;s a new world with a bunch of new mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T14:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8d0/8d0ecdf342058e29f24f4aaf21fa9f6c.jpg", "website": "http://supragames.de", "rating": 4.13, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 174, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Supra Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
