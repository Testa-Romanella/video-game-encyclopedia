For another hand, the word Nanuk (or Nanook) originates in the indigenous languages of North America and means \"polar bear\". In Inuit mythology he was the master of bears.\r\n</p>\n<p>Pichi is a small penguin who seeks to survive together with his family, in the face of climate change that is leaving him without food due to the increase in temperature on our planet and in the face of adversity decides to act to avoid devastating consequences. Similarly, Nanuk, who is the villain, has to leave his habitat to search for food.\r\n</p>\n<p>As such, we can find, such as what happened at the south pole, in which due to the unusual levels in the ice banks, the Adelaide penguins were forced to go further in search of food, leaving about 40 thousand young penguins who died at the mercy of climate and hunger. At the north pole, polar bears began to change their seal diet to eggs, causing an imbalance in the biological rhythm of ecosystems.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Kickstarter of this game was\u00a0successfully and was funded in 24 hrs. Also, this game won the national contest of videogames in M\u00e9xico in 2017 (Videojuegos MX).</p>\n<p>And finally, this game was approved to be on consoles (Nintendo Switch and Xbox) but due to the high cost of the devkits, the console release was delay. If you want to support us, we will appreciate it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:33:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42a12c0ae927371b69550b4a1442fd87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dog_Biscuit_Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
