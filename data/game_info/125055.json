Should be a slightly better experience now, but I'm still working on it in the post jam version.</p><p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p><p>You are a dung beetle. You hate those other dung beetles. Or they are dung beetle zombies? They're green, anyhow.</p><p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/></p><p>In DUNG BEETLE VIEW move around (WASD) and collect the falling dung before other dung beetles do. When you think your dung ball is big enough, deposit it at the weird hut looking cave things to load it up into your ammo. Then go to TOWER FIGHTING VIEW (spacebar) where you can either use that dung ball to defend or attack. But be quick, because those zombie(?) dung beetles don't rest.</p><p>Or you could watch this video where I can't speak good: https://youtu.be/ZVgsz3Ac0aM</p><p><strong>CONTROLS WHEN BEING A DUNG BEETLE</strong></p><ul><li>WASD to move;</li><li>Spacebar to switch to tower view.</li></ul><p><strong>CONTROLS WHEN TOWER FIGHTING</strong></p><ul><li>Right click on your own areas to give them health.</li><li>Left click on the enemy areas to fire a dungball at them.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/8451ad2e0e8941957ec649ec303090a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FIFOgamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
