There is one \"track\" in which you have to pass through the checkpoints in any order then head back to the start to complete the level. Times are recorded and saved once you pass the start/finish after passing through all the checkpoints. Times are visible in the Main Menu.</p>\n<p>The game matches the theme as the car gives you little control over it with your inability to turn correctly, as well as the control scheme being actively counter intuitive.</p>\n<p>Made in Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>'W' = Forward Left side</p>\n<p>'S' = Backward Left side</p>\n<p>'Up arrow' = Forward Right side</p>\n<p>'Down arrow' = Backward Right side</p>\n<p>'Escape/P' = Pause</p>\n<p>'Enter' = Reset level</p>\n<p>'R' = change camera angle</p>\n<p>The art assets used are all either from the Starter Content provided in UE4 with the material for the wheels of the car\u00a0coming from the Quixel Megascans (that are free to use with UE4 projects). All code (done in Unreal Engine's Blueprints visual scripting system) was done during the jam.</p>\n<p>As a side note, no prefab code was used for the car, it was done entirely from scratch (which is why the car is a bit glitchy).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:18:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/ece360ab7b0e275d9ed28fae00ffe8e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Misdirection Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
