Collect the three stones of morning to break this night and greet a new day. A word to the wise, don\u2019t let the fire go out. Dark things walk in the night.<br/></p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>You play as a young savior burdened with the task of collecting the lost morning stones. Collecting the stones and bringing them to your bonfire will break the curse of the wolf and flightless bird. <br/></p>\n<p>Along the way you will encounter hapless animals lost in the darkness, and monstrosities of the never ending night - you'd best avoid the later. The only true victory is   to save these poor animals before placing the last morning stone onto the fire. Otherwise, the poor creatures will be lost to the darkness forever.</p>\n<p>No matter what happens you will always have your bonfire and your faithful companion, snuffles. No daemon of the night can take those from you...<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move with WSAD or the arrow keys</li><li>Run by pressing space</li><li>Cut trees by pressing space when facing a tree</li><li>To pick up a log press space while facing a log</li><li>To put a log on the fire press space when facing the fire</li><li>Press period '.' to skip to the credits</li></ul><p><strong>For greatest immersion set your resolution to 1280 x 720 and activate the full screen mode in game.<br/></strong></p><p>There are 3 cannon difficulty modes, which can be selected from the credits page.
