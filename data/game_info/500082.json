This can make some jumps harder at lower rates. The game is built and tested at 144Hz, so that is what I recommend you play on, but I realize that is not possible for many people. The game\u00a0<em>should</em> be beatable at any refresh rate though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d130f6f5efb1fcfb8a73d9ca9c6e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Summy99"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
