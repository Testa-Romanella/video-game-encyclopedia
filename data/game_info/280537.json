With two main paths and two endings apiece, your choices make all the difference in this game. Navigate the protagonist through her life in moments good and bad\u00a0and form dynamic relationships with the characters around her, including three possible romantic relationships (2 female-1 male)\u00a0which affect how the plot unfolds. Short, but packs a punch. There is no one true, perfect ending--\u00a0multiple playthroughs are highly encouraged.</p>\n<p>Brief content warnings for:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Depictions of misogyny and homophobia, including the usage of the f***** and b**** slurs in one particular ending</li><li>Abstract depictions of violence and death, especially notable repeated mention of blood</li><li>Mild loss of reality in particular paths</li><li>References to self-harm and thoughts of it</li><li>Sexual implications and a few naughty words but it's all 8 bit so nothing explicit\u00a0</li><li>Not sure if this belongs here, but particular strain of content revolves around Catholicism which some may have sensitivity to in many directions</li></ul>\n<p>This isn't a game I\u00a0originally thought I\u00a0would post publicly!\u00a0I made it for a college course and then expanded upon it for my final--this here is that expanded version. But a few friends and classmates encouraged me, so here it is! Fans of <em>Fire Emblem</em> may notice some <em>Sacred Stones</em> inspiration! Though this deviates far, far from that narrative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you might tell from the aesthetics this was entirely created in Bitsy, a lovely little program that I reaaaaaally pushed the limits of, with some help from the Borksy game hacker. Yeah I know the visuals kinda suck cuz I'm no artist and had to make it all myself\u00a0but hopefully it's still playable :p</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c168ddf4645c06b38b00e74bea8583be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["unassumingvenusaur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
