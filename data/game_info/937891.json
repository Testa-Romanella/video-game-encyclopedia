The majority of the project was done following instructions and using assets from a Gamedev.tv tutorial, with a few additions to make it more complete as a game. It's a very simple game and should only take a few minutes to play through. Feedback is greatly appreciated. If there are any bugs or features you think should be added, I'd love to challenge myself and try to learn more by implementing other features!</p>\n<p>PS - It's only designed for 1600x900, so you'll have to play full screen and it probably won't work on a phone. Dynamic sizing is beyond my ability right now, but hopefully I\u00a0can learn that for my next game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a130224d4d9a02359614009c1fe8f0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silver_Guillotine"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
