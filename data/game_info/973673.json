Her magical-girl powers easily vanquish the enemy, but a surprise ambush forces her to dive in harm\u2019s way to shield him\u2014leaving both fatally wounded. Luckily, Miss Fujiko arrives on the scene with an enchanted thread to bind both their life forces, sparing them from certain death.<br/><br/>Over the next three months as Seiji and Yuuri slowly recover, the pair are on doctor\u2019s orders to stay within one meter of each other or risk snapping their \u201cred string of fate.\u201d With his dream girl only centimeters away at every waking moment, will Seiji finally summon the courage to shoot his shot?<h3>CHARACTERS </h3><br/><strong>Yuuri Kamiizumi </strong><br/>Voice: Ichigo Momoi <br/><br/>A First-Class Stars bearing the name \u201cRigel.\u201d As an expert manipulator of all things light magic, she pulverizes demons to dust with overwhelming baseball-themed finesse. <br/><br/>Popular on campus for her cute looks and nice-girl undercover persona. Beneath the mask, while still upbeat and generous, she can be conceited and a sore loser who often gets stuck on one-upping others. For all her bluster, it doesn\u2019t take much to crack her defenses. <br/><br/>\u201cNuh-uh, this First-Class Stars has ZERO chinks in her armor. Not one!\u201d <br/><br/><br/><strong>Maja Krienke </strong><br/>Voice: Ion Momoyama <br/><br/>A young woman recruited and contracted by a Majin under mysterious circumstances. As a Stars Killer, she enrolls at Seiji\u2019s academy to defeat Yuuri, Kanoko, and the other Stars. In contrast to Yuuri\u2019s light-wielding magic, Maja commands the darkness\u2014and wields a mean sword to boot. <br/><br/>Seriously single-minded, she is above all else a warrior of her word, which only makes her Majin alliance more puzzling. <br/><br/>\u201cI am Maja Krienke. Once I defeat you, I will subjugate the entire Far East!\u201d <br/><br/><br/><strong>Kanoko Satake </strong><br/>Voice: Yuki Nekomura <br/><br/>A Stars bearing the name \u201cSadalmelik.\u201d Though still a freshman, her Stars skills already surpass some of the organization\u2019s best.<br/><br/>Chill and seemingly unfazed even in a pinch, she prefers to avoid social small talk, with few exceptions. Obsessed with her campus senior Yuuri as her magical-girl master and mentor, she devotes her time off to serving her every whim. Amazing in the kitchen and a wizard at domestic chores. <br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more than for you to rely on me for everything...\u201d <br/><br/><br/><strong>Fujiko Yonamine </strong><br/>Voice: Yuuha Nitta <br/><br/>A retired Stars who bore the name \u201cAncha.\u201d An active member of the Starry Sky Council\u2019s East Kanagawa Branch. Revered for her powerful healing magic since her demon-vanquishing days, she continues to provide support spells while devoting her time to guiding the next generation of Stars. <br/><br/>Has her fair share of airhead moments, but is overall a mild-mannered pacifist. <br/><br/>\u201cYaaay!
