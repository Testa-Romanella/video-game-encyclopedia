The premise of the game is that you are in a forest fire and you need to get out.<br/><br/>Controls: Arrow keys are for movement and SPACE bar is for jumping.<br/><br/>The player will only have 3 health and after that they are killed. The fires (the orange boxes) will take one point of health every time the player touches them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8e7db7901f00f2dee0fa0cfc564c1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerard Gilmartin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
