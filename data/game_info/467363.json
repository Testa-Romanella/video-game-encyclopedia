Each time it hits the fence, it bounces off and spawns another egg. It also gets faster with each bounce, as do all of the other eggs, to the point that they can break the laws of physics and start shooting out of the pen (which, believe it or not, was an intentional design decision, not just a common collision bug). How many times can you click these eggs in one minute?</p>\n<p><strong>MUSIC:</strong> \"Acceleregg\"\u00a0by LMC_Jarred</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 using Unity 2018.
