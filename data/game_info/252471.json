{"id": 252471, "slug": "airport-madness-1", "name": "Airport Madness 1", "name_original": "Airport Madness 1", "description": "The very first version of the Airport Madness series. Manage runways and taxiways at a complex airport. Move airplanes as quickly as you can while avoiding air traffic disasters. More game than simulation, this is a fun look at air traffic control from a \"runways &amp; taxiways\" perspective. Knowledge of air traffic control is not required. This game takes a visual approach to air traffic control within the airport environment. Keep aircraft separated by timing the takeoff and taxi clearances that you give. Don't make them wait! The game gradually builds in complexity and intensity with each new level. Once you have 3 mishaps, the game ends. The full version provides you with a game of longer duration, no advertisements, and a downloadable program that exists on your computer, with no internet connection required to play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e72708338f5e4561c9a727fe53d9daf6_06C2brK.jpg", "website": "http://bigfatsimulations.com/game/airportmadness1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Big Fat Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
