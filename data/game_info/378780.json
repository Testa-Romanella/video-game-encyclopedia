He tries to make everything to survive and gets involved with a drug dealer. His job is to make deliveries in New York City to the clients. The problem gets bigger once he starts to try the drugs too, so he will be affected by them, making the game so confusing: changing environments, different controls, speed... making the game so much challenging for the player.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME ONLY IN SPANISH!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement\u00a0(and dialogue navigation): Left and Right arrow<br/>Jump: Up arrow<br/>Landing: Down arrow<br/>Pause: P</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>David Arnau Hern\u00e1ndez: menu and dialogue design<br/>Jos\u00e9 Daroqui Plaza: programing player movement, levels and game navigation<br/>Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez Rodr\u00edguez: player design and animaiton, buildings and background design<br/></p><p>2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897c31344b4284b740a6dd33ed1ff883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmpersandEntertainment"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
