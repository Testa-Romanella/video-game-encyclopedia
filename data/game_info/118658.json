Someone has gained unauthorized control over the entire ship and its AI, and there's no one around to explain to you how or why. Find out what happened and deal with the enemy accordingly. An Army of combat drones stands between you and the vessel's command control room, and you're lucky to be the only one strong enough to get there.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>*Fast-action gun play and movement, think fast or DIE\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Tougher enemy combatants, be relentless or FAIL\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Handful of powerful weaponry, each one serving a PURPOSE\u00a0</p>\n<p>*No limit on max ammo, find it; TAKE IT\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Unforgiving battle scenarios, make every decision COUNT</p>\n<p><strong>GOODIES\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>*Secrets\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Infinite ONSLAUGHT mode</p>\n<p>*Original metal soundtrack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da5b99cdc72e4016f0bf254d7129fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EyeBladeStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
