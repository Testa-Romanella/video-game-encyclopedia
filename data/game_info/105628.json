Teeth.</p>\n<p>Teeth is a game about a lonely fighter in a world that is dark and full of terrors. He has to find the creature, who orchestrated all of this - the enemies trying to kill him and the world full of traps - and KILL IT.\u00a0 Indeed, only a few Chosen ones managed to do so. Will you be the next One?<br/></p>\n<p>The game feautures physics (falling blocks can kill enemies or cause barell explosions), ricocheting bullets - be careful, you can even kill yourself. You can get achievements for various kind of kills, and you also compete with other players in global highscores.</p>\n<p>There are also stats after each game, in an \"elevator\" to another level, so you can see how you did compared to others.</p>\n<p>P.S. The game has a hidden collectable usable easter egg. I would start looking in the menu section.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also features soundtrack from Gaden Rhoss, Allias, Kevin MacLeod and more explosively good artists</p>\n<p>LET'S PLAY from CaptainZero: <br/></p>\n<p>You forgot to use RIGHT MOUSE to RUN, Captain! :D<br/></p>\n<p>My Twitter @EugenikOfficial.
