It looks like something out of an 80's sci-fi movie. You turn it on and you realize it is the lost device of a space traveller, with all their log transmissions (a diary of sorts).<br/></p>\n<p>\u2018Transmissions\u2019 is not so much a game, but a serial story converted into a Gameboy game. I wrote and released it in instalments on Instagram and via RSS, every other day in 2020. There is no gameplay, other than you reading what the traveller was up to before the device was lost.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls in browser:</strong><br/><strong>J</strong>: <em>next/confirm</em><br/><strong>K</strong>: <em>back</em><strong>enter</strong><em>: menu<br/><strong>shift</strong><strong>:</strong> /<br/></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/7103e0a9dcdf0cfad2250b8e25eb1281.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["rembrandx"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
