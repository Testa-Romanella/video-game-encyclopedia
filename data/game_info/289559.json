The theme was\u00a0<em>\"What home means to you\"</em>. Instead of creating a game inside a house, someone going back to his home or something like that, we decided to make a game about people who do not have a place to live,\u00a0homeless people.<br/></p>\n<p>Because we meant to make a funny game, we replaced the characters by pigeons and birds in general. The player must protect his fire, since it is the only thing that keeps him alive, by taking down his opponents, and reviving the flame with his wings. Killing the enemies will increase the player's energy and determination, and eventually allows him to use a<strong>\u00a0fancy special attack !</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Move the pigeon with <strong>Q and D</strong>, fire with <strong>Left Click</strong>, and use <strong>E</strong> to revive the fire !</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\nTimothey Delhaize \u2022 Character Design &amp; Animation\r\nAntoine Raffy-Vion \u2022 Environment Art &amp; Sound Design\r\nRobin Six \u2022 Unity Development", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a03/a0363e86d3923ee5bf6ba17b9d143b35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robin Six - Saering"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
