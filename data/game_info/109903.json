Tired of the treatments and medicines that didn't help save her despite having\u00a0spent a large part of her life staying in the hospital, she decides to escape the hospital to fulfil her bucket list with the help of a boy who broke his arm in a recent car crash and\u00a0\u00a0a mysterious new guy, who is unwilling to reveal much about himself to the other two.
