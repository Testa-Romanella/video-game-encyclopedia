However i di manage to get what i meant across with level almost complete and the annoying physics of ethan playable. so enjoy the game and please give me feedback, it would\u00a0be much appreciated and hilarious to know your experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82bf3a15588569ade3c70ed350eb976f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tahmim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
