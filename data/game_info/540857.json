{"id": 540857, "slug": "gather-build-survive-mobile", "name": "Gather Build Survive (Mobile)", "name_original": "Gather Build Survive (Mobile)", "description": "<p>\"Gather Build Survive\" it's a game where you have to survive in an apocalyptic universe (not clear yet if it's a nuclear, natural disaster or a virus outbreak).</p>\n<p>You have a base which will be a house that has number of rooms (bathroom,bedroom,living room,kitchen,garden,workshop)</p>\n<p>In the house you do most of the work, like preparing meals, planting seeds, building materials and also upgrading items in the house and much more, also maintain the resources in the house such as food, electricity, water and building materials.</p>\n<p>Scavenging is a way to collect some resources too, in a way these features makes it more of a Survival-Resource Management game.</p>\n<p>Yet the character has attributes such (Health,Energy,Hunger,Bladder,Hygiene) which you need to regard while doing different things and attend to them, which gives it a Sim-like hype.</p>\n<p>And the quirky thing also about it is \"Clicker\" in which I'm planning to add whenever you wanna do some tasks such as \"Upgrading the storage\" , \"Building a barricade\" , \"Cook a meal\" ...</p>\n<p>So before doing the task you need to complete a tapping challenge in which failing won't affect the fact per-se but will drain a specific attribute from the character.</p>\n<p>This tapping feature is still into discussion -between me and me- but so far it's in the plan.</p>\n<p>Last but not least this won't be only one level, it'll have several ones, more like an adventure game.</p>\n<p>The first one in the house, the rest is still not decided yet but I have so many ideas.</p>\n<p>The next one could be escaping to a under-ground shelter due to a nuclear bomb or creating a space-ship to fly away to an another planet or even crafting a ship and sail towards some military base ...</p>\n<p>The idea of transiting from region to region will make it way much cooler, makes the game not really repetitive but slightly repetitive with a progressing story in which every level has a certain environment, interactions, objectives and adventures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5ef9c1a3341fefa640b0fa1f969b28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antarsoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
