Currently in early access, right now you can<br/><br/><ul><li>Watch water flow through the landscape, eroding and depositing the land to form complex arrangements of tributary river systems, river deltas, lakes and oceans in an emergent fashion.<br/></li><li>Observe the ecosystem respond to the availability of water.  Plants automatically gross across the lanscape with different plants thriving in different environments depending on the distribution of water, nutrients and the geometry of the land.<br/></li><li>Create your landscape using simulated plate tectonics, watching mountains form, grow and erode as millions of years pass in the blink of an eye.  Customize the landscape to your will, raising, lowering and flattening it to see how the enviornment changes as a result<br/></li><li>Zoom all the way from looking at an individual tree or plant to view the entire map across hundreds of square kilometres</li></ul><br/>In future releases, the game will<br/><ul><li>Allow saving and loading worlds<br/></li><li>Have a fully simulated enviornment with not just water but also climate factors such as temperature, weather, ice, snow, wind and ocean currents forming and changing depending on the geography as well as affecting each other<br/></li><li>Feature a wide variety and animal and plant species that flourish across the map according to the geography as well as each other.
