During that year, you\u2019ll plant, water, and harvest your corn to make you money so you can buy more at the Spring Market. You can see how far along you are in the farming phase by checking the Season Clock in the top right corner. Once winter ends the Spring Market begins!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Spring Market</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll start the game in the Spring Market. You may purchase cards from the Market to go to your \u201cHand\u201d for the upcoming farming year (the next Farm phase).\r\n</p>\n<p>When the Market begins, you\u2019ll see the cards you have in your hand for the upcoming year in the bottom left of the screen. Each year has an \u201cOmen\u201d, represented with an Omen Card, which you\u2019ll see in your hand before you purchase anything. In the top right of the screen, you\u2019ll see how much money you currently have to spend on the cards at the Market.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Your Hand</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your Hand is on the bottom left of the screen at all times. You can have a maximum of 5 cards in your hand, which includes your Seed Card (which is always there) and at least one Omen Card (which you get at the start of every Spring Market). When you purchase cards at the Spring Market, the cards go to your hand. That means you can purchase a maximum of 3 Helper Cards each Market (2 Helper Cards if one of them is cursed). Choose your purchases wisely!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Helper Cards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cards help you with your farming. You can purchase the card to help you out that year or you can \u201cUpgrade\u201d the card to improve the benefits the card gives you. The upgrades are permanent, but you\u2019ll have to buy all new Helper Cards when the year ends. Every Spring Market, one of the Helper Cards will be \u201ccursed\u201d and show up in purple. Purchasing the cursed card will come with an Omen Card. Keep your Hand limit of 5 cards in mind when purchasing a cursed Helper card! The cursed Helper Cards can still be upgraded.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Omen Cards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cards will impede your ability to farm in some way or another. Omen cards can \u201ccurse\u201d Helper Cards in the Spring Market, which will appear in purple.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Seed Card</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your Seed Card is basically your variety of seed that you can plant. Your seeds can be upgraded in the Spring Market to yield more corn when harvested.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Farming</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Farming phase is all about quick clicking! You\u2019ll see your plot of land in the middle of the screen, each tile can be clicked to either plant a seed, water the seed, or harvest the crop. Clicking the plot will perform the action appropriate for that plot, no need to press a button to harvest vs water.\r\n</p>\n<p>A seed will not grow unless it is watered. This is displayed visually by darkened soil. If you have the Drought Omen, be sure to look out for crops that dry up before being ready to harvest!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Crows</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The crows are hungry! They\u2019ll swoop in from the side to steal your crops. Click on them to \u201cbanish\u201d them before they make off with your money!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:42:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff522ab9265eac7eec23a02da405c2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emanaretne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
