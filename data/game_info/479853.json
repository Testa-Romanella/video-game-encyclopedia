{"id": 479853, "slug": "the-last-air-freighter", "name": "The Last Air Freighter", "name_original": "The Last Air Freighter", "description": "<p><strong>The Last Air Freighter</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are the last available pilot on the local island and 3 important packages have to be delivered at all cost, you have an under performing plane, you have no extra cargo space, but you indeed have a plane and a pilots license and sometimes that's all you need around here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed over 5 days based on an idea i've had for a while but never executed it, this version is a very tiny part of a much larger scope and was cut short and made a lot more linear due to time constraints. All assets and code are made by me except for music, ui sounds, and textures.</p>\n<p>I also apologize in advance for the abrupt startup at the game, I lost a lot of time and didn't finish the menu or startup sequence, you will also have to close the game out manually when you are done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD &amp; QE - For aircraft control surfaces</p>\n<p>F &amp; R - To extend and retract flaps</p>\n<p>SHIFT &amp; L CTRL - For throttle</p>\n<p>RIGHT MOUSE - To rotate camera around your plane</p>\n<p>SPACE - For your wheel brakes</p>\n\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Climbing</strong></p>\n<p>*Remember that you use more fuel when you are heavy\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Your takeoff roll is much greater at a heavy weight so be patient on takeoff</p>\n<p>*Best climb airspeed with low weight is 64 mph</p>\n<p>*Best climb airspeed with high weight is around 76 - 80 mph</p>\n<p><strong>Runways</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*Runways are indicated by dirt and sand so land on that stuff!</p>\n<p><strong>Don't be a bad pilot</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*Yea don't go near the water.... please, come on you know this stuff.</p>\n<p>*Remember to keep an eye on your weight and don't come in too slow when you have the packages on your plane.</p>\n<p>*Don't hesitate to make a go around if you think you're not gonna make the landing.</p>\n<p>*Don't sit on the runway enjoying the environment too much you're just wasting gas!</p>\n<p><strong>Slipstreams</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*Follow the slipstream which give you tailwinds so you can save a ton of fuel\u00a0to find the island to pickup and deliver the packages.</p>\n<p>- Remember to reduce power when you are in the slipstream to save the most fuel</p>\n<p>- Slipstreams are made to guide you and help your plane perform better, however remember no to go upwind and go against the stream or you might stall and end up with the fishes!</p>\n<p><strong>Cruise flight</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*Cruise at 62 - 64% throttle to get a good balance on performance to fuel saving ratio</p>\n<p>*Don't forget to monitor your fuel level and find gas cans around one of the islands to add some fuel if you end up low.</p>\n<p><strong>Landing</strong><br/></p>\n<p>*Use flaps to create drag and add some lift when you wanna come in slow!</p>\n<p>*You will find some gas cans at the delivery island probably.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df335e8151c95926dfc8aebdce056cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teddy27"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
