So the gun is not only for shooting but also for movement.<br/><br/>I was very short of time because I had many things to do within the 48-hours. So there were only 8 levels... :( Quite disappointed. Though I think it was fun though it was short.<br/><br/>Thanks to Andre for the Background Music.<br/>\u00a0--- &gt; Sound Cloud &lt; ---</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2bb40a5e200d53ac3768fdad9be5ba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Larry Indie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
