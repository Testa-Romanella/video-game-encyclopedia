Use it to pump water out of the unstable mine below you to prevent its collapse</strong></p>\n<p>The Atmospheric engine is not a simple thing, it must be treated correctly. Place coal in the boiler to create steam that you then let into the cylinder. When the cylinder is orange it is full of steam and is ready to be cooled down (using the coolant water that you will have to periodically refill), creating a vacuum that will pull the piston down. Repeat this until you or the poor miners below you's death please.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The atmospheric engine should be at least semi-correct so you have learnt something by playing this game as well. :)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>All mouse, click stuff to pick it up or to toggle it. You can press M to mute the music though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e23fbfe36b215974d2901607d1f58e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["axelrinaldo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
