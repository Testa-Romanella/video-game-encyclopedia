Recently the league's scientists have discovered a way to go back in time, allowing members to relive events while attempting to obtain a better outcome from it. This however comes at a cost as you are splitting time into two different timelines and abandoning your previous timeline to die.</p>\n<p>Recently, a swarm of aliens have descended onto earth, trying to take the planet for themselves. Defend earth from the alien onslaught and go back in time with your collected upgrades to push past more and more defenses.</p>\n<p>Made in 2 days for the brackeys jam</p><p>Note the splash screen says press space.

If aimed correctly this can easily snipe an enemy that may otherwise give you trouble<br/></p>\n<p>- After you shoot too many bullets, the ship will reload for a bit preventing you from firing. Doing other actions while this is occurring doesn't affect it at all so it is a prime opportunity to use your dodge moves with an optional parry for some extra damage and bullet avoidance<br/></p>\r\nDiscord\r\n<p>Feel free to join our discord server to hang out and get notified for any updates or future games we push out :)</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/JqmaaY32Kt</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Ategon - Code</p>\n<p>Din - Art</p>\n<p>Coeur - Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b4aaa61bf24b259a0441bc356f73fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ategon", "Coeur", "Team Auboreal", "Din"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
