Now the ultimate tool, becomes your ultimate enemy in an old school epic Light Cycles Duel.</p><p>Based on the Tron movies this is basically a lightcycles game. The game features Turn AND Swipe controls. </p><p>Light Cycles are vehicles resembling motorcycles that are driven by programs in the Game Grid. Upon being rezzed in by a program's rod, a light cycle completely covers the driver - who is forced into a riding position - with a protective canopy. Each Light Cycle is colored according to the color of the rod that generated it.</p><p>On the Grid designed for them, light cycles are incredibly fast when moving, and leave behind a solid jetwall in their wake. They move in straight lines and only turn in 90\u00b0 angles. With their brakes disabled, this creates a hazard whereby one light cycle could be forced to crash into the jetwall of another, causing the victim to derez along with their light cycle.</p><p>Can you beat the computer or another player in a Light Bike duel?</p><p>Features single and two player modes! For Free!</p><p>- Human VS Computer<br/>- Human VS Human (two players on one device!)<br/>- Human VS Computer VS Human<br/>- Human VS Computer VS Human VS Computer (two players on one device!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf4d12d5881fe8009aa08f847e02f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sander Voorn"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
