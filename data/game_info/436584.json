The box always slides 2 blocks, but you can prevent this by colliding with other, immovable crates. If the box slides off the ice into the water, you'll have to start over again. Gradually, the levels will get more and more complex.</p>\n<p>We've currently created more than 300 levels, but we're constantly adding more! You too can create your own levels and submit them to us.</p>\n<p>Box Slider is available for Android on Google Play, see link below.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711f2192124f4871621a928300108387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SingularityGD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
