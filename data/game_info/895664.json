Receive your missions from the village elders and investigate the surrounding forest. Look for clues, talismans, and seal the yokai away to protect the people.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Long ago, during the Edo period, Yugure Village was infamous for the attacks of the devious and cunning Yo-Kai surrounding the village. Then, a priestess sealed up all the Yo-Kai in the shrine, which did not exist then. After that, the village had peace for about 400 years. Until one day, the shrine mysteriously broke, releasing all the Yo-Kai from their rocky prison. Now, a famed paranormal investigator from the United States visits the village to try and end their Yo-kai threat once and for all\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Players will be venturing out into the biome beyond the village gates and completing tasks specific to each quest given to them. Some might be retrieval quests to craft items such as talismans to use to vanquish the Yo-Kai and others might be dealing with each Yo-Kai themselves.<br/></p>\n<p>There are Five Quests - Four Item Retrieval Missions and One Kappa Extermination Mission.</p>\r\nAkuno Studios\u00a0\r\n<p>\ud83d\udc79 Sam Pendergast - Writer, Team Lead<br/>\ud83d\udc79 Grant\u00a0Stephens - Programmer<br/>\ud83d\udc79 Alon Dadon - Programmer<br/>\ud83d\udc79 Hannah Mayorga - Designer</p>\r\nA Special Thanks\r\n<p>This game wouldn't have been made possible if not for the talented work of the creators of the following assets.
