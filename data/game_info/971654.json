With the help of a modular design system, just about any spaceship-looking shape can be built, relying on real physics principles to determine flight characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExperience smooth zero-g flight mechanics that capture the disorienting thrills of space dogfighting while keeping the controls intuitive, simple and accessible as pure keyboard + mouse. The environment is dusty and atmospheric, which has a profound impact on the space physics involved - drones never come to a stop and are limited in speed only by how hard they can accelerate for their size.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDrone building is engineered with simplicity in mind without compromising player creativity. A Drone design consists of modules and hulls. Modules offer a variety of behavior, such as thrusters and autocannons, that give a drone its basic abilities. The shape of a drone arises from the way its modules are arranged and how they're connected together with hulls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T22:12:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a4fcd3ba914d07ea6a2e8f0470fd49a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Float Between The Molecules"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Float Between The Molecules"], "esrb_rating": null}
