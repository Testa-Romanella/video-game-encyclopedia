That is until an off world mining corporation sees those crystals as product.<br/>Play as a living crystal and explore the caves and mines and drive back the miners from your home using natural crystal powers such as light refraction and sound resonating (realistic physics do not apply).</p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun designing this one but had a bit of trouble with our own ambition. We had the help of another team member: Rafwil who composed the music for the game and made the SFX.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is not complete we had trouble implementing the finale in time. We hope to fix a lot of the bugs in this release soon but first we're going to take a break for a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art: The_Wolvesbane<br/>Code: Mooserider<br/>Music &amp; Sound: Rafwil</p>\n\n<p>WASD, arrow keys, and controller d-pad for movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T11:34:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d64034666965eaf0efc889b0a187e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sombrarrow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
