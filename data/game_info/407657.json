{"id": 407657, "slug": "button-rpg", "name": "Button RPG", "name_original": "Button RPG", "description": "<p>Enter a world in which every day brings forth potential situations in which, we as humans, must react to with the utmost caution. Do we lean towards justice and help people out? Or do we become complacent and let things be as they are without giving much thought?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Level up your character's stats based on the <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong> decisions you make!</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy hand-crafted pixel art from BurterButterBeans Studio.</p>\n<p>The game is in early development. Your feedback would help motivate me to create content and improve the existing concept.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong>:</p>\n<p>1. Add more animations for the outcomes of situations</p>\n<p>2. Add a quest system that starts randomly at the beginning of each playthrough</p>\n<p>3. Add a personality test that examines your decisions and categorizes you once you beat the game</p>\n<p>4. Try to make the game somewhat rogue-like :)</p>\n<p>5. Provide a humorous, entertaining and fun experience for you all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Update 1/30/2020 @7:23pm Android demo available. Download .apk.

Sorry.</strong></li><li><strong>Currently where it stands, the following have animations\u00a0for all outcomes:</strong></li></ul>\n<p><em>\"A dog appears before you. He looks hungry, weak, and thirsty.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"An elderly lady has tripped and fallen. She cannot get up.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"There is a fire in the forest quickly spreading.\"<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>The following situation:</p>\n<p><em>\"A huge goblin appears before you.\"</em></p>\n<p>has only 1 button that can be clicked for now: \"FIGHT\" and in there, only \"Sword Slash\" and \"Red Potion\" can be used, but are fully playable and can win the fight. Conditions for player dying have not been implemented yet. Will be sure to do so within the next few days.</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Enjoy and leave a comment!
