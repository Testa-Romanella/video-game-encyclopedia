The game follows four characters who, for reasons unknown, live on a floating island within a seemingly endless sky. In order to gain a better understanding of their surroundings, they explore the skies around them with their airship, the Chronos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is one of the first games in a series by the same creator, and it recently celebrated it's 10th birthday. Though it's an older series, it has a lot of mysterious elements to it that I've seen discussions of even to this day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Game engine</strong>:\u00a0 \u00a0RPG Maker XP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Playtime</strong>:\u00a0 ~10 hours\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Content warning</strong>:\u00a0 Depictions\u00a0of death, language</p>\n<p>Original website (Japanese): http://kawasakibu.web.fc2.com/sce/index.html</p>\n<p>Developer's website (Japanese): https://mos.fanbox.cc/</p>\n<p>Developer's Twitter (Japanese): https://twitter.com/sce2_dev?lang=en</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Features&gt;</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Five endings plus a secret ending\u00a0</li><li>Original music and artwork\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>&lt;Characters&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zelkova</strong>\u00a0(\"Keyaki\" in the Japanese version)</p>\n\n<p>The central figure of the group. The Chronos (their airship) doesn't take off without him.\u00a0He acts like a typical leader, but nobody seems to mind. That's because he's the leader.\u00a0He doesn't seem to be too capable in terms of the game's mechanics,\u00a0but everyone seems to have faith in him regardless. Is that really the case though?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Camellia\u00a0</strong>(\"Sazanka\" in the Japanese version)<br/></p>\n\n<p>The copilot. A bit silly and outspoken.\u00a0\u00a0When partnered with Zelkova, she'll demonstrate various useful in-flight skills including\u00a0meter tuning, weight control, and overall flight optimization.\u00a0Zelkova has faith in her for this reason, just as she has faith in him.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Azalea</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The mechanic. Doesn't like venturing out too much as he's more of an indoor person.\u00a0For this reason, many of his skills are only effective while he's left at the base.\u00a0His very desire to stay indoors itself has given him unique indoor abilities,\u00a0giving him a good excuse to not leave.\u00a0However, he might be forced to in order for him to level up. Reality is cruel like that.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Apricot</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Management. An irrational sleepyhead who won't wake up even when jolted, hit, pushed, or pulled.\u00a0Her sleep that distances her from the waking world is caused by nothing more than her own free will.\u00a0Perhaps she sleeps a little too much. It's hard to understand what she's saying sometimes,\u00a0but her extensive management capabilities are highly valued.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&lt;Instructions&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>Simply run \"Launcher.exe\".</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;How to play&gt;</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Menu navigation and general movement: [Arrow Keys]</li><li>Confirm/continue text: [C Key] by default.</li><li>Cancel/Back: [X Key] by default.</li><li>Config menu: [F1]</li><li>Reset: [F12]</li><li>Text can be skipped by holding the [X Key] or [CTRL].</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Dreamsavior, whose translation software (Translator++) made this project possible.\u00a0</li><li>enigmaopoeia from\u00a0Memories of Fear,\u00a0whose generous assistance and mentoring also made this project possible.</li><li>Katrina who generously offered her assistance in editing.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Please help me out by reporting any typos, bugs, or any other errors down below!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T12:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/5485503ee15a8e903d85e4b94dc22e5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["not_worldTL"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
