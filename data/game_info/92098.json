We've been handling sales on our own website for about a year, but now that our prototype is out we've decided to bring the game to Itch.io!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPurchasing the prototype gets you a bunch of cool stuff and helps us keep working on this game. Any extra money we earn goes directly into making the game better - art, voices, extra polish bits and etc. Lately we've been showing the game locally, so your purchase also helps us get things like signage, equipment, covers travel costs and more.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>New updates are bi-weekly!</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>$<strong>17+</strong> gets you:<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to current prototype updates + pre-alpha + alpha + beta + final access</li>\n<li>Wallpapers</li>\n<li>Discord invite</li>\n<li>Mailing list access</li><li>The original soundtrack by 2 Mello</li><li>Podcast</li></ul>\n<p>\n<strong>The Soundtrack</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll original soundtrack by \r\n\t2 Mello!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Prototype</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is currently in it's prototype phase.\u00a0At this time the prototype can be played with \r\n\t<strong>1 or 2 players</strong> for training room practice, or <strong>4 players</strong> for competitive play.</p>\n<p>Check out this video to learn more about the game's core mechanics:<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Upcoming features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Command normals</strong></li><li><strong>7 more characters</strong></li><li><strong>Online play</strong></li><li><strong>1v1, 2v2, and 1v2 gameplay</strong> - while the core of Cerebrawl is heavily based on 2v2 4-player gameplay, we want to experiment with all types of player configurations</li><li><strong>Stage breaks </strong>- break down walls to extend stages, or bust through the floor and drop into a smaller area.
