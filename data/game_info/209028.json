Avoid getting hit by\u00a0the asteroids and orange enemies. Cubical map also wraps around everything except bullets.</p>\n<p>Default keybindings (can be changed in-game):</p>\n<ul><li>Look direction = WASD</li><li>Movement = Arrow Keys</li><li>Roll = QE</li><li>Aim = Left Shift</li><li>Shoot = Spacebar</li><li>Switch Weapon = C</li><li>Toggle 3rd/1st person = V</li><li>Pause Game = P</li></ul>\n<p>Types of Weapons:</p>\n<ul><li>Standard: Single shot, can spam as fast as you want. Regular sized laser.</li><li>Machine Gun: Hold down the shoot button to shoot continuously. Shoots smaller lasers faster.</li><li>Big Laser: Hold down the shoot button to fire off a friggin huge monster laser.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Developer commentary:</p>\n<p>idk I like where this went in terms of controls (maybe having mouse controls would be better too?) and overall feel, but I suck at making challenging things beyond that. AI took forever even tho it's so bad. Might come back to this, probably not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d1a8a3f198912dd546a64fe6f804c2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PolyWolf"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
