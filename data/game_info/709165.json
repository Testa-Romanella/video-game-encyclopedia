Every time a mine cart unloads at the end of the railway track, they go down the stairs to collect the gems.<br/><br/>Each level has a grid of squares with colored gems occupying some of the squares.

Difficulty is primarily determined by the size of the grid, ranging from 4x4 to 7x7 squares.<br/><br/>1 - Click on a gemstone mine and drag the mouse towards another gemstone mine of the same color:<br/><br/>2 - All barrels must be destroyed:<br/><br/>3 - Railway tracks may not intersect:<br/><br/>4 - The kittens go down the stairs to collect the gems:<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Solve <strong>200 puzzles</strong> carefully selected;<br/></li><li> Enjoy four different types of environments;<br/></li><li> Soundtrack to help you keep your focus and concentration;<br/></li><li> Everything in the game was made with a lot of love and craftsmanship.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T04:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a229c5168f983f080998be4e8c12b4bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minicactus Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Minicactus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
