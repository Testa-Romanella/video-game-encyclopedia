I love that they're so simple, yet so complex at the same time. Not only do I love the physical buildings, I also love the architectural model that most will never have the pleasure to see. <strong>So, I made it into a walking sim. </strong></p><p>There isn't really a point to this 'game', just walk around and enjoy the great work done by Blacket Smith Architects. It's a really complex structure, but I've done my best to do it justice. Have a play, and walk around an architectural model in a new way. I'm really just trying to experiment with new ways to combine architecture and games, so I hope you enjoy it! </p><p><strong>Special thanks to:</strong></p><p>Blacket Smith Architects, for letting me use their design! They've made some really fantastic stuff, so if you're interested in more work like this, give them a google!<br/><br/></p><p>Nymano for letting me use their music. Not only are they an amazing composer, they're super friendly as well! <br/>Give them a listen at : https://soundcloud.com/nymano</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/323c1c08caa287f6a35e3036b147f836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["smitleu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
