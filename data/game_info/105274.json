I wanted to demonstrate a feeling of home through the idea of <em>'Nurture by Nature'</em>, which relates to our individual experiences of growing up having great ramifications on who we are and how we act in different spaces. <em><strong>Home Grown</strong></em> depicts this in the form of the player going through the actions of growing a garden. I decided on the idea of looking after a garden because gardening is an explicit set of narrow rules that allows the creation of your own unique space. By working on their personalised garden, the player creates a familiar space that feels like home.</p><p><strong>Game Credits:</strong></p><p><strong>Nicholas Staracek</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Game Designer, Audio, and Additional Code\u00a0-\u00a0Website</p>\n<p><strong>Zoe Lovatt </strong>- Graphic Design -<strong> </strong>Website</p>\n<p><strong>Rebecca Owen </strong>- Animation - Website</p>\n<p><strong>Kelvin Tse</strong> - Animation - Blog</p>\n<p><strong>Pritish Choudhary </strong>- Programming - Blog</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Change log for Version 1.4 includes (latest):</strong><br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Short introductory tutorial on first day cycle</li><li>Controls Menu updated with correct information</li><li>Particle effect updates</li><li>Exit application button, located on main menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Change log for Version 1.3 included:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Full keyboard and mouse support for Windows and Mac</li><li>Full game pad support for Windows</li><li>Bug fixes</li><li>Audio tweaking</li><li>New baked lighting system</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc4855b83b36af69708acb3d8f427e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nicholas Staracek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
