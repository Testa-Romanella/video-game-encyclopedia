No gameplay was changed whatsoever.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the player is to jump off a high building, avoid obstacles, smash through the colored windows, and successfully land in a designated area using a parachute. The players gain points by flying very close to other buildings, which is referred to as \u201ckissing\u201d and by staying close to them which is called \u201chugging.\u201d The players are also able to gain bonus points by spray painting the buildings, interacting with fans, or insulting the protestors. Even hitting a bird awards players a small number of points.</p>\n<p>The game features a rating system, which evaluates the player&#39;s performance. The better the player performance is - the more in-game currency called \u201cTeeth\u201d they are awarded. Teeth are used for unlocking new levels and modes, new graffiti, items, and gestures. The game also features leaderboards, where the players can compete with each other.</p>\n<p>The remastered version of the game features refined graphics, a new \u201cExpert\u201d difficulty level with new levels as well as all the other levels from the original game.
