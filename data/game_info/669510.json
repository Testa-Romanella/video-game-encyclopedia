You were just standing around outside and suddenly the earth beneath you collapsed! Now you have to avoid the obstacles while you descent into the earth's core.</p>\n<p>Controls: Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows, or A\u00a0and D keys, to move. Press the Down arrow, or S key, to perform a stomp, and press the\u00a0SPACE bar to perform a dash.</p>\n<p>Dashing allows you to quickly move to another area mid-air, while also momentarily halting your descent. Dashing can be crucial to avoid obstacles that are too close to dodge, but you only have a certain number of dashes available at a time, so you will have to use them wisely.</p>\n<p>Stomping allows you to damage enemies and also adds an extra dash to perform after stomping on an enemy. Stomping is crucial in order to avoid enemies and to replenish your dash ability, but stomping makes you fall faster, slows your horizontal movement, and prevents you from dashing until you collide with another object.</p>\n<p>The game is never ending, so there is always a reason to come back and improve your score. How deep can you go?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e6/0e61eea80787ce02ec960ee5857ebe60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["J can2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
