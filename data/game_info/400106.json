This version of the game has 5 levels, with the first and fifth (where the arc concludes)\u00a0primarily serving as narrative set-pieces.\u00a0There is quite a bit of cut content and we had to remove some already implemented mechanics (such as bombs, gravity changes, and vacations)\u00a0for design simplicity, and also because many of these mechanics had not yet been play-tested. A\u00a0future iteration of the game would probably include more of these cut mechanics and storylines. Do try and see if you can beat the game!\u00a0The difficulty is quite a bit toned down from the mechanically intense cut levels we had designed (although it is still a bit challenging).</p>\n<p>Made at the NYU Game Center for Game Studio 1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c32151b4d4abb81b9a27e2b244dd9e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kulfikid", "K.
