It was a personal challenge to see if I could make it through, using a low budget and Ren'py. The project still feels a bit rough around the edges, but I think I got rid of the major bugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The best part is that it's <strong>ABSOLUTELY FREE!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The main (and only) girl is kind of a half-human half spider kind of character. The story is a bit weird and dark and also very violent at times. I would say maybe 16+ as a rating? The setting would be a near future with a bit of a post-apocalyptic feel to it. It has about 18 Bad Ends and 3 Good Ends. A bonus route and Good End gets unlocked when all the 3 routes and their respective Good Ends have been seen. I could only test the PC version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ok, fine, presentation of the main and only girl:</p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li><strong>Name: </strong>Aneidea</li><li><strong>Race:\u00a0</strong>Girl-Spider something...</li><li><strong>Age:\u00a0</strong>Older than you...</li><li><strong>Blood Type:\u00a0</strong>Not Really Human...</li><li><strong>Personality:\u00a0</strong>Oh, you will find out soon enough...</li></ul>\n<p>Please leave me your (constructive) comments and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Ahem, I think I\u00a0forgot to remove the saved game data from the final built... will fix that soon... (Oops, sorry!) will work on that shortly...</p>\n<p>Ok, so now the newest version 0.14 does not have saved games from my testing phase...</p><p>There was a bug in the Bonus Route. It should be fixed in the new version 0.16</p>\n<p>P.S. I also have a ko-fi page... just saying...\u00a0https://ko-fi.com/alexpaq</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b7623431154f219a00cbbc37479a4932.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AlexPaq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
