Tell stories to earn your stay for the night!</p>\n<p>This version is a demo. There are 2 posters (doors) to explore, 3 roles (effects) to find, and 7 story fragments to collect. Roles change the way NPCs and items react to you, so use them to progress. If you max out a story's fragments, you have finished the story. I plan to add more in future updates. I hope you enjoy what the demo has to offer so far!</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>old-timey black-and-white limited palette!</li><li>jumping!</li><li>humans-- Wait, humans?
