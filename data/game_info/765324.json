Adam Woodsmith is a self-taught surreal/Horror artist with a love for the macabre. Primary Color Man Origins was made for the Primary Color Man GameJam. The game was made in around 10 sleepless days with the idea of giving Primary Color Man some backstory.\u00a0<br/><br/>I didn't just want to make a chase-based game, and I wanted the player to have moments of peace to enjoy the colorful world I have created. Using puzzles was a great way of allowing me to give the player a different sense of horror, with a slow build-up. Primary Color Man has always been given a playful, almost comedic sense of horror so I decided to play on that and focus the game around a circus/playhouse setting.</p>\n\n<p>You are the new supervisor at Vincible Paint Co. After an accident involving the last supervisor, you are tasked with fulfilling your duties and also attending your induction. After the induction video finishes, you decide to head home and pick up from where you left off, but for some reason, you never make it out of the building. What happens next is a surreal stroll through Primary Color Man's world, filled with puzzles and backstory on how he came to be. Can you stop him from claiming your life?</p>\n\n<p>Primary Color Man Origins is filled with 3 main puzzle rooms. In each room, there will be a solution to each puzzle. There is also one core mechanic that you will unlock as you progress through the story that will help you defeat Primary Color Man. Upon completion, a secret menu will unlock with a special easter egg for those who are diligent enough.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Walk - WASD<br/>Look - Mouse<br/>Sprint - Left Shift (Hold)<br/>Jump - Space Bar<br/>Use Music Box - R<br/>Flashlight - F<br/>Interact - Left Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Special thanks to the following people for additional art/voices/sounds<br/><br/>Espy @AlexanderBruyns for their Artwork of Primary Color Man<br/><br/>Burk @BiYurck for their Artwork of Primary Color Man</p>\n<p>Freesound.org SFX under the creative commons 0 licenses<br/><br/>Adam Woodsmith for the use of his Character in my game<br/><br/>The Judge King @TheJudgeKing for putting together the game jam<br/><br/>All of my amazing Patrons who support me &amp; what I do!</p>\n\n<p>If you want to support me and all of the stuff I do please consider joining my Patreon where you get early access and exclusive games each month!
