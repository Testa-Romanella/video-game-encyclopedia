But this becomes more difficult from level to level and every little mistake can bring a quick end. At the beginning there are 4 training levels in which you get to know the most important elements. Every 5th level is a boss level. In the other levels there are jetpacks, alien opponents, saws, dangerous swings and much more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d02cb1dd7a975c44b54a232523d8c9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BlitzCaser"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
