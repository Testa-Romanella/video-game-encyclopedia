I plan to expand upon it post-jam, but for now, it is a relatively simple FPS with some SHMUP elements, and a subtle story. Maybe you'll figure it out, maybe you won't bother, but it's their either way.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Don't die, you've already been there and it was boring, hence your ghostliness. So if dying again is off the table, what should you do? Well, I'll let you figure that one out, but getting off the ship might not be a bad idea. Shoot what shoots you, kill what hates you, and leave what holds you.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>WASD - Move<br/>LMB - Shoot<br/>E - Interact</p><p>Good luck, girl.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fenreliania"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
