Play as a Titan or see what if scenarios like what if\u00a0humans where the giant ones or if titans were tiny! There are still lots of issues like typos, kinda wonky AI at times, broken animations, and more. These are all being fixed right now and as I fix and improve things I will release free updates. Please be patient as these issues are ironed out but the version that is up now is perfectly playable besides some errors here and there. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs feel free to tell me and I will consider your idea or try to find a fix. Hope you download it and enjoy it! See you on the field soldier!<br/><br/>Future Plans:<br/>- Add in more titan enemies<br/>- Add in more modes<br/>- Improve AI<br/>- Iron out bugs<br/>- Add more levels<br/>- Add in more sounds effects (ie. when titans walk or attack)<br/>- and more!<br/><br/>Feedback is appreciated :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T05:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aad/aad2ad6446f08d12f13c1a74c5977a08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Ace Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
