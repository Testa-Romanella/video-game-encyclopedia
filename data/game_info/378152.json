Dreams can be wonderful places to be in and explore. But when they end you would sometimes get the feeling of missing a good and happy moment. Lucid Explorer is promoted by its own community to accomplish the recreation of dream worlds in a virtual environment. A Xer Network account is required to play this game. You can create an account within the game in less than a minute.</p>\n\n<p>When the player is about to dream, published levels would then be randomly chosen to experience. Dreams are controlled by a random hidden time limit that indicates when the player will wake up from their dream. After the dream is over the player then has the ability to give feedback to the original creator by either liking or disliking. This will help the creator improve the given dream.</p>\r\n\r\n                \ud835\udcd2\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcf6\ud835\udcf6\ud835\udcfe\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udd02 \ud835\udcdc\ud835\udcea\ud835\udced\ud835\udcee \ud835\udce4\ud835\udcf9\ud835\udced\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfc\r\n\n<p>The contribution feature allows people to help send assets and suggestions for new content updates.

You can easily learn how to recognize the tools in a matter of minutes with a tutorial below.</p>\r\n\r\n                  \ud835\udcd2\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcf7 \ud835\udce3\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcfc / \ud835\udcd5\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udcfe\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfc \r\n\n<p>These tools reference file utilities for use in mainly saving or loading a project. The first one towards exiting, the second towards saving, the third towards creating an empty project, and lastly opening a saved level.</p>\n\n<p>The first and second in this column are both related to undo and redo which has a hotkey of both CTRL - Z and CTRL - Y, the third leads to deleting an object, fourth and last one leads to duplicating up to multiple objects at once which has a hotkey of CTRL - C.</p>\n\n<p>In this column the first allows you to drag the position of an object. The second allows rotation, the third allows scale, and lastly the fourth allows a snapping distance that applies to the first three tools on the left of this image.</p>\n\n<p>The resource browser gives you the ability to place objects inside your scene just by clicking on any of the models shown. Once an object is placed inside the scene you can change its properties using the inspector or change its position, rotation, or scale by using the top tools in orange color.</p>\n\n<p>The inspector allows you to edit the properties of an object or tool blocks. Here are some references on how to use these tool blocks.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, event triggers allow you to create actions based on the area the player is in. You can hide an object and allow event triggers to re-enable a hidden object when the player is located where the event was placed. This is useful for unexpected in-game moments inside the lucid dream.</p>\n\n<p>The graphic setting tool block is useful for controlling the post-processing effects within a scene such as fog, pixelation, tone mapping, and more including the lucid effect which can go all the way up to 4 modes in a scene.</p>\n\n<p>This block gives the ability to play in-game music that can reflect and give atmosphere within your scene. This comes with many settings such as volume, loop, and a list of music to choose from for your scene. You can also use event triggers to manipulate the current state of the music block to fit in each and every part of your lucid world.</p>\n\n<p>The final features relate to playtesting your scene and publishing when done.</p>\r\n\r\n                    \ud835\udcdf\ud835\udcfe\ud835\udceb\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcfc\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf0 \ud835\udcd0 \ud835\udce6\ud835\udcf8\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udced\r\n\n<p>In the publishing window, you will see these three options. The first button relates to updating a level that you have already published on the network. Updating your level requires a code generated from uploading from square one. As soon as its updated people will then see and experience the changes you made inside the same level. Uploading as new gives you the full-on ability to publicly release a world you have made. People will then come across your level inside dream mode and give you feedback using the in-game rating system for design improvement. And lastly, managing a world allows you to check the total plays your level has gotten including the total likes and dislikes received. Didn't like what you have published? Deleting your published level is also a possibility that hides the scene from the public to see.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:33:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a18/a1829ab0815eca8f73267cf76769a270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XerStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
