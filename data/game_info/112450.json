The prompt words were staccato, prolong, and mass.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game where you had projectiles flying at you too-fast and you use a time slow move to make them avoidable. Still a game about reflexes, but in when you choose to start reacting more so than in the reaction itself I\u00a0guess.\u00a0I realised in my head when I was picturing the projectiles firing, I was picturing them doing so at the tune of Sandstorm by Darude. So I, uh, \u00a0made this.</p>\n<p>Dodge projectiles for the length of the song. Use your bullet shield to slow down projectiles to give you a chance to get out of the way. Collect batteries to recharge your shield.</p>\n<p>All the projectiles are generated by a terrible midi version of the song, using Unity's Spectrum Analyser function (huge thanks to Steve Halliwell for showing me how to do this. I had to get the right tracks to isolate the sounds I wanted, use these sounds to generate the events that spawn the missiles, then put the audiosource of those sounds through a Mixer so I could then mute them and instead just play the full midi track. Originally I wanted to play the proper version of the song, but it didn't line up perfectly with any of the midis I found so we get this.</p>\n<p>I only worked on this game over a 50 hour period and I was pretty sick to death of it pretty soon after I started. Mostly thanks to hearing the song so much! But I learned a whole lot about Unity and audio that I'm real excited to play around with on a less trash project in the future.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Update 1.1:\u00a0</strong>Added a quick hacky new mechanic where if you stay still for over ten seconds you start to get bigger. This is a cheap solution to the fact there are places on the map that you can just stay still and avoid all projectiles.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move - mouse</p>\n<p>Shield - left click or z<br/></p>\n<p>Restart - r</p>\n<p>Quit - esc</p>\n<p>As usual, Windows version not yet tested.</p>\n<p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #26 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c43d5e1551c5d9490ff319fc55fa005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
