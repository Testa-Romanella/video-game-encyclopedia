It is a little bit of a puzzle game as well as a platformer though\u00a0where you need to jump onto different platforms around you until you eventually find the finish line.\u00a0 There is also fake finish lines though so dont be mislead! You might spent 5 minutes jumping on platforms in one direction just to find that you have gone the wrong way.\u00a0I believe it would be a great game to race against your friends in and speedrun. It will be getting updates most likely fixing small issues and making the map bigger and harder,\u00a0 possibly adding more levels even.\u00a0 Enjoy:)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>The basic controls are</p>\n<p>move left - A/right arrow\u00a0</p>\n<p>move right - D/left arrow</p>\n<p>jump - space bar</p>\n<p>to press buttons use the left mouse button</p>\n<p>those are all the controls but they are also in the game if you need them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T18:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197def71f24b9d2656c4de686d0a373c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xemulator"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
