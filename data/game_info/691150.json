Avoid the Ghosts at all costs.<br/>Once your body temperature reaches a certain point, it's game over.<br/>The colder you are, the slower you move, and the faster you freeze.<br/>Try to survive as long as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0<br/>Jonathan A.: Programming, \"Art\", Sound Design<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sound Effects: Wind, Rewind, Freeze - ZapSplat.com; <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Walking -\u00a0OrangeFreeSounds.com<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Music: Made with pre-made loops using Soundtrap.com<br/>Seven WK7B: Playtester, Ghostless% Highscore Holder (324)<br/><br/>Made with Unity<br/><br/>Made for the Mini Jame Gam #5 Game Jam (2021)<br/>Theme: \"Temperature\", Special Object: \"A clock\"</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Note:\u00a0</strong><br/>I am pretty new at making video games, so this game isn't that big or attractive.
