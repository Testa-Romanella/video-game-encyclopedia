Make games.\r\n</p>\n<p>A game about control- create and share your own platforming levels with the buttery-smooth controls and moveset of Battery Chad! Experiment with dozens upon dozens of mechanics in the level editor, create puzzles, contraptions and obstacle courses! You can save your levels to a Level Code, and combine up to 99 of your levels into a World Code, which functions as a level playlist, loading levels one after the other.

Can you beat the level-building AI at its own game? Use your shock attack to pulverize enemies, fall slowly through the air, or even activate machines and contraptions- but be careful of traps, and nefarious bosses! Make the perfect high and low jumps to traverse through levels!
