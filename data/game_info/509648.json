I want to learn more in the future about unity and c#. I don't have a mac or linux machine to test these versions of the game on, so there may be problems downloading those versions. I know the game is kinda rough too since it is my first game ever, so feedback would be appreciated that way I can keep the feedback in mind for my future games.The android version will be available soon, probably by tomorrow or wednesday.</p>\n<p>Also, Credit to the planet Jupiter for letting me use his remixes and music. His youtube link:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7pSE1HaYbk1eBK6ixRsCfw</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I made a update to all the versions and download links. I added android version and I fixed the score to where everytime you die and restart or go to menu, the score will reset to 0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca9/ca9c84e8d5e4e84435694170ad2a6875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["the_fluffinator"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
