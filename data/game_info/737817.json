Some obstacles influence how far he moves, though, so you\u2019ll need to use them to your advantage. Here\u2019s what they do:\r\n</p>\n<p>Walls - stop him dead in his tracks, regardless of how far he\u2019s moved.\r\n</p>\n<p>Puddles \u2013 slow him down, reducing the number of tiles\u00a0he can move in that turn.</p>\n<strong>The Goose:</strong>\n<p>The Goose always spawns after a couple turns in a level and immediately starts following your trail. He will do exactly the same moves as you, but he\u2019s quicker! So, he\u2019ll catch up by at least one tile with every move he makes. Don\u2019t let him catch-up; he has that knife in his beak for a reason\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Try not to fall off the edges; it's bad for your health.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\r\nProgramming and Development:\r\n<ul><li>@KingPieEater</li><li>@CenturionMC<br/>\n</li></ul>\r\nArt and Animation:\r\n<ul><li>@KingPieEater<br/>\n</li></ul>\r\nLevel Design:\r\n<ul><li>@CenturionMC</li></ul>\r\nSFX:\r\n<ul><li>Pixabay</li></ul>\r\nUI Theme:\r\n<ul><li>https://azagaya.itch.io/kenneys-ui-theme</li></ul>\r\nMusic:\r\n<ul><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/all-good-folks/jump-jive\u00a0<br/>License code: CN8HJMDVBN9ZYLXX</li><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/cutesy-chamber-ensemble/aw-cute<br/>License code: OFT2SSZFSK0ET7OV</li><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/jonny-boyle/funny-in-france<br/>License code: LVUTIIAZWGUH6XZB</li><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/roo-walker/excusez-moi<br/>License code: DDPAHC13VYZTBAYZ</li><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/giulio-fazio/get-wacky<br/>License code: DIHBWFNYDC8DJ8YD</li><li>https://uppbeat.io/t/jonny-boyle/gypsy-jaxx<br/>License code: HLRGZ1O8FFJ8R080</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T11:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c4738f6b9d6a2d495db7c26f16468bee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KingPieEater", "CenturionMC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
