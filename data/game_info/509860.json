The theme for the sixth week was 'Secrets'. Which meant that we could choose any game idea we desired, as long as it involved 'secrets' in one way or another. I chose to create a level based game where you have to de-scramble the word and click the correct image/item, whilst trying to complete each level within the given time and trying not to click the bombs.\u00a0 I thoroughly enjoyed making this game so i will most likely add to and improve it in the future if i see potential to do so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Download the game and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Also check out my other games on my profile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3ccb23d3f6a6e62edb3285d4fa28a6f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
