Keep in mind that elevators are not the only thing she can tinker with!</li><li><strong>Revamp of basic Mechanics: </strong>We'd like to give the game a little more depth, so we plan on giving Lily additional atributes like HP, throw distance, throw power and such. This opens up great possibilities for what can be found in her exploration!</li><li><strong>More Lore:\u00a0</strong>There's so much more than meets the eye. A few paintings definately are not enough storytelling!</li><li><strong>Extra Cinematic:\u00a0</strong>She woke up? It's as if something is missing though... Where was that voice coming from? What's it like outside the nightmare?\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>And remember:</p>\n<p><strong>If you find yourself feeling lonely, chances are, you were never alone to begin with!</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/109/1098d930fe64b176eae23165c8da5318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raffen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
