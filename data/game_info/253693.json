Players have different playing styles and talk, saying different things.  Playing options include classic Hearts rules where the opening lead is the two of Clubs, hearts count as 1 point and the Queen of Spades is 13 points.  Shooting the Moon adds 26 points to the other players.  Optionally, the Jack of Diamonds is -10 points and taking no tricks is -3 points.  The Twanger option resets any score at the end of each hand that is a multiple of 25 (including 0) to the average of the remaining high and low scores.  The Magic Number, selected at random, counts as a Twanger hit and also carries a 10 point assessment, called an Asterisk, at the end of the game.  Asterisks also are assessed for looking at the Kitty when you are not supposed to and for leading a Heart before Hearts have been broken.  Only the player winning the first Heart may look at the Kitty.<br/>     The Jack of Diamonds, no tricks, Twangers, Magic Number, Kitty, and Asterisks all are options that can be chosen by the user.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8f6558273eab199268913d66dce1868_q4LezAt.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ken Fox"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Ken Fox"], "esrb_rating": null}
