With no recourse at your disposal other than instinctive reflexes stemming from an overpowering urge for survival, you must battle your way through seven levels of monster-infested mayhem, hopefully without becoming lunch along the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Heavily inspired by such classic PSX-era beat'em ups as \"Nightmare Creatures\" and \"Fighting Force\", \"SNAILS\" features unrelenting combat against oversized monstrosities that harbor little incentive other than making you their next meal.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to withstand the ravaging plague of evil denizens infesting your neighborhood?  But, more importantly, do you have what it takes to relive the 90's, all over again?<br/><br/>Play and find out!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c227a90cb3be9e3bcf317613b8eda5a8.jpg", "website": "http://www.snailsvideogame.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 109}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexandre Fontoura", "Jorge Lima", "Tadpole Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2Brains Games", "Tadpole Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
