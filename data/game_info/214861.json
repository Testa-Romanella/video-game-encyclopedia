I didn't have enought time to do all my ideas, because I worked all days as I am an employee, so I was doing this game all evenings after work. But the main is here, so \"it's ok\".</p>\n<p>Playing this game is\u00a0an experiment in an\u00a0art game.... But be carefull, cause you may loose (the game, and your mind.... MOUHAHAHA....) eh eh... sorry... just let's try it! ^^</p>\n<p>Hoping you will have fun playing.\u00a0 :)<br/></p>\n<p>Please let your feedbacks in comments to let me know if you have enjoying the game and what did you like or dislike.
