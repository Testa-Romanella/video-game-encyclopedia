We're a group of students developing this game as a part of one of our exams. We're planning on continuing the development of this game in the near future, depending on the feedback we get from the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself is a Roguelike Platformer, where you can play as different characters, and utilize different kinds of abilities to try and escape hell. There will be a wide variety of enemies to overcome as well, all with different kinds of attacks and abilities of their own, that you'll need to overcome and defeat using the abilities available to you. There is also planned a variety of bosses, based of the \"regular\" enemies, meaning they have similar abilities as they're base counter-part, but have updated visuals and their attacks are a lot heavier both in damage and speed than their regular counter part.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The overall visuals in the game are based heavily on Dante's Inferno, but we've taken a more cartoonish route, so everyone can be able to enjoy the game, no matter the age of the individual. We also thought it would be funny if you had to fight your way through as a very cartoonish doll with wild ass abilities. Excuse my french.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the future development, we'll be using Unity to upgrade the game, meaning we don't have to hard code a lot of the things we have to now, since we're using Monogames as a framework to start, so we have a better understanding of how the code looks at its core, before we take \"The easy way out\" and use a program as innovative and easy to use as Unity. This is a necessary process for us as students, as we're doing this not only because we want to make games that people like yourself will enjoy, but because we're still learning how to make games and how to program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The visuals in the game will also be updated along with the game it self, and we're hoping to get animations and a lot of the polishing done as well as possible, so that you as a player, will get the best experience possible playing\u00a0the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a7b4ecafe178456a04df049a8b9c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Penguins on Wine"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
