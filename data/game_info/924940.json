The required limitation was \"Everything is tied to the rhythm\".\u00a0Enemies will spawn during certain moments of the music and the player must keep juggling and dashing toward enemies to build a big enough damage multiplier to kill them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Hold AD to move</li><li>Hold WS to look up or down</li><li>Hold space to jump</li><li>Left alt to dash</li><li>Left mouse to attack</li><li>ESC to close the game</li></ul>\n<p>Successful hits will build\u00a0a temporary damage multiplier. This multiplier will rapidly deplete if you don't attack anything for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>You will attack in the direction\u00a0you are looking. Hold WASD to make your character look where you want to attack. They can only attack in 4 directions.</p>\n<p>If you attack an enemy while looking down\u00a0you will bounce (pogo) off them.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to survive as long as you can\u00a0and kill as many enemies\u00a0as you can.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Made using Unity.</p>\n<p>SFX made using Bfxr 8-bit sound generator.</p>\n<p>Art and music made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:47:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b33/b336df0e26a192ae38dba013e735196c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuinnCG"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
