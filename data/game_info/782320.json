Achieve a target determined by the lab upon the clone's creation and it will be freed as a successful clone. However, make sure not to fall prey to the lab's questionable practices as they keep you on your toes along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the clone's chambers, you will be able to interact with objects to take care of its needs and skills. Director AI will track your performance and how much menace you are experiencing and trigger disasters, increase the likelihood of events and send your clone off for tests according to these metrics.
