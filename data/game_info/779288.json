Explore a suburban neighborhood, a sprawling city, and a sparse countryside as an investigative photo journalist in search of his next big scoop. Take pictures of interesting things in the environment like car accidents or angry Karens, and then use the game's built-in photo editing software to turn your pictures into artwork! Use the pen tool to draw red circles and arrows, use the sticker tool to place emojis all over the canvas, and use the various filters to really make the image pop!</p>\n<p>As you complete the game's levels, you'll interact with \"The Boss\", an old curmudgeon who expects only the best from his employees. Don't disappoint him!</p>\n<p>Your photos will be saved to the \"screenshots\"\u00a0folder as PNGs. Share them with your friends on social media, and consider uploading them to\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/r/FotoGraffiti/</p>\n<p>This game was made by <strong>Daniel Fuerlinger</strong> and <strong>Jayson Mangis</strong>\u00a0for CS426 at George Mason University.
