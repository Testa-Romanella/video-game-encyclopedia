Time of Heroes could use some more bells and whistles to streamline the flow of battle in updates, but its sheer level of depth and challenge make this an absolutely unmissable title for genre fans.\"<br/><br/>- TOUCHARCADE REVIEW (****): <br/>\"Time of Heroes nails the most important elements of a good strategy game. When you combine the large amount of depth on the gameplay side with a good narrative tale and a fairly decent control scheme, Time of Heroes is well worth a recommendation for any fan of strategic turn-based games.\"<br/><br/>- ARCADELIFE REVIEW (82/100): <br/>\"As a complete package, Time of Heroes works incredibly well. The land and characters have their own lore and the story, although fairly simple, provides plenty of believable motivation.\"<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>If you run into problems, whether technical or gameplay problems: CONTACT US! contact@smuttlewerk.de<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The second campaign is out!
