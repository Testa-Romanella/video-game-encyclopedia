Rats have invaded the island of Mauritius!\r\n</p>\n<p>As the last of the dodos, how long can you evade this new invasive species? Gain more time by seeking out delicious fruit, but don't let the rats catch you!\r\n</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>The\u00a0Dodo\u00a0is an extinct flightless bird which was only found on the\u00a0island of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean. First mentioned by sailors in the 1500\u2019s, Dodos were driven to extinction within 200 years or less of their discovery. The poster child for extinction due to human interference, modern scientists believe that while sailors clubbed and ate their share of the plump birds, this was likely not the principal cause of their extinction. Rather, it was probably more to do with the\u00a0introduction of other species\u00a0(e.g., pigs, monkeys and rats) by humans which variously competed with the dodos for food and/or ate their eggs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>Most of the dodo remains found in museums today are skeletons reconstructed from bones found at the\u00a0Mare aux Songes\u00a0locality in Mauritius. The\u00a0ROM\u2019s skeleton\u00a0was originally assembled in the 1860s by\u00a0Sir Richard Owen\u00a0(the man who, among other accomplishments,\u00a0came up with the word \u201cdinosaur\u201d). Originally purchased by Harvard University, the ROM traded an\u00a0<em>Anchiceratops</em>\u00a0skull for it in 1938 - it is the only dodo skeleton in Canada.\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f2dd396e929ff8049f6772f33c50a2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
