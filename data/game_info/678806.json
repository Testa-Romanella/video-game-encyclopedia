Tones of toxic waste have been ejected out of earths atmosphere and into space. But what goes up must come down! Blast away as much toxic waste as you can before it hurtles back to earth!</p>\n<p>Shoot asteroid and toxic waste to gain points. If any toxic waste goes past without being shot down it will increase radiation by 1. If radiation reaches 5 the game will be over! Get hit by any object and your ship will be\u00a0destroyed, resulting in a game over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't shoot the Anti-Toxic pods!
