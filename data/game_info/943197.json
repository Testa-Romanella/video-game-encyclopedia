With no time to prepare, these students must use their wits and weapons found around the campus to fight off hordes of undead and survive in this new, dangerous world. Armed with an arsenal of weapons found around the campus, players must scavenge for food and supplies. With no end goal in sight other than to survive as long as possible, it's a battle to the death against waves of the undead. Will you be able to stay alive and outlast the zombie apocalypse?</p>\r\nObjectives\r\n<p>Survive for as long as you can against multiple hordes of enemies!
