But, he needs the minds of hell's other denizens to do so. As he explores their minds one question seems to permeate, \"Why would anyone choose hell over heaven?\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe objective of this dialogue heavy philosophical platformer/runner is to reach a goal speed by avoiding and bouncing off of obstacles by using a grapple-based movement system. There are only three buttons, up, down, and pull/push. Small mistakes are fine as there is no restarting or death since it's your average recent speed that matters. Instead players should find themselves entering a zen-like flow as they attempt to achieve maximum velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHorrible graphics I know, but I promise the story is great and the gameplay is fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/922/922616af8021b63a52e6bc5298c5a0fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 102}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grey Gods"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grey Gods"], "esrb_rating": null}
