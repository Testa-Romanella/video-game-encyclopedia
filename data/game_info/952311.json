Levels mode is a good place to start.</p>\n<p>1. You are the red tile on a square board.</p>\n<p>2. Swipe horizontally or vertically to move.</p>\n<p>3. When you move you reduce tiles value in the direction you are going.</p>\n<p> - The amount of this reduction is equal to your starting point tile value.</p>\n<p> - But if the value of a tile would be equal to 1 or 2, there will be an increase instead of a decrease.</p>\n<p> - Negative numbers become positive.</p>\n<p> - If the value of a tile becomes equal to zero, starting tile value becomes zero too. Tiles have been \"Deleted\".</p>\n<p>4. You earn as many points as the value of the deleted tiles.</p>\n<p>5. The aim is to delete almost every tile while trying to make the most points.</p>\n<p>6. In multiplayer matches a player can win by deleting opponent's tile.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854f0e0d35907ed82f4a335c7e877fb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["deepdaikon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
