It is a VR game optimized for Oculus Quest and can be played alone or in multiplayer.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>I made this prototype in one week and am far away from having all the features I\u00a0wanted implemented, like active motors that can be controlled with sticks and buttons and the possibility to stand on the vehicle while it is driving. I\u00a0also would have liked to add parts for flying vehicles. Those things are NOT there yet, but I\u00a0may add them in the future.</p>\n<p>Usability is also a bit lacking: A and X toggle through the 4 available building blocks, trigger creates a new object or grabs an existing one without effecting other parts, while the grab button will grab something and move it with everything that is\u00a0attached to it around.</p>\n<p>The available parts are: Box, Plane, Cylinder and Motor. These parts are loaded from json files and are easy to add or customize, but for this to work correctly\u00a0in multiplayer everyone needs to have the same set of modules.</p>\n<p>Unless everyone is inside the same network multiplayer needs port forwarding and your external IP address.</p>\n<p>Vehicle Construction Kit is\u00a0using my own game engine \"Rayne\", which seems to be somewhat stable but could potentially have all kind of issues. I\u00a0am using PhysX for the physics simulation, OpenAL Soft and libOpus\u00a0for the Audio, Enet and Protobuf\u00a0for Networking and a couple of other libraries.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c855e9877d67713ad449a0da736aba79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Slin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
