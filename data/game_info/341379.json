It has no sound, is still using some placeholders, misses a few animations an overall polish. It is still playable though! Thanks for trying it.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lots of left clicks on explicit buttons, which is nice</li><li>Mouse wheel to zoom/unzoom, and drag around the map</li><li>A and E to rotate buildings before placing them</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to shoot the crystal with your laser ship.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Shooting the laser costs 3 units of methane , 3 units of oxygen , and you also need to have 3 units of energy\u00a0 available (but they won't be consumed).</p>\n<p>This is the laser. It occupies 3 tiles in a row (sorry for the z-value issue).<br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is the first building you have to place. It's free and produces 1 energy.<br/></p>\n<p>You can rotate the buildings with A and E before you place them, but not later.<br/></p>\n<p>This mirror allows you to redirect the laser in other directions, indicated by the black dot :</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you'll have mountains on your way. You can destroy them by shooting them with the laser.</p>\n\n<p>Build solar panels to produce more energy .</p>\n\n<p>Build the drill on an iron oxide deposit to harvest iron\u00a0 and oxygen .<br/></p>\n<p>Build the pump on a methane lake to harvest methane\u00a0 .<br/></p>\n<br/><br/><strong>You can't disable or sell a building after you've placed it, so think twice before you do.</strong><br/><br/>The game is made with Godot, which is awesome, and you should start using it :D<br/>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming\u00a0\u00a0 - \u00a0 J-Star</li><li>Art \u00a0 - \u00a0 Raindrinker</li><li>Original concept \u00a0 - \u00a0 Space Monkey</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Space Monkey", "J-Star"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
