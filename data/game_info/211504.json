(I know that Wayne Tech would pay for some of that but I doubt it would cover everything, like that would totally give away their affiliation with the batman.)\u00a0Well in our world, no matter if you are a hero or a villian, everyone is at least responsible enough to pay the fines for everything they've destroyed.</p>\n<p>Heroes and villians, do your best to kill each other. But be careful, because you will pay for any public or private property\u00a0you destroy. And once you cannot afford to pay the fines, you will be put into jail right away, even if you have saved this city's a** over 9000 times.</p>\n<p>Also, we ... eh ... forgot to put a way to end the game. So, you will be trapped in the game FOREVER! MUHAHAHAHA! (Until you ALT+TAB and close it of course).</p>\n<p>Made with Unity.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Haotian Shen<br/>Ido Lechner<br/>Daniel Park<br/>Anna Stassen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb5/cb58c795992ae8f9eea5cdf3e769417a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sparK1N9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
