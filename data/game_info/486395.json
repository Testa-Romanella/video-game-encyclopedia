When you meet another egg, you'll fight at Shifumi (Rock Paper Scissors) with a chance to evolve as a Chicken ! In the same way, Chicken evolves to Dinosaur and Dinosaurs become Super Dinosaurs ! During a Shifumi, if you play the same move as your opponent, you both regress to your last evolve !</p>\n<p> <br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But be aware that a more evolved player than you can eat you without warning or shifumi !
