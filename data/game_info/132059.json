It will not guide you over the obstacles. You have to overcome the obstacles by yourself.\u00a0You will fall down, but don't take that too personally. Start over and get to the top!</p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Climb mountains</li><li>Jump over chasms</li><li>Avoid spikes</li><li>Collect stars</li><li>Race against time</li><li>Find hidden levels</li><li>Spin left</li><li>Spin right</li><li>Hit the green box</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>on\u00a0<strong>Android</strong>: Hold left side of the screen to spin left or right side of the screen to spin right. Press Back Button to restart the level if you get stuck.</li><li>on\u00a0<strong>Windows</strong>: Hold left arrow key\u00a0to spin left or right arrow key\u00a0to spin right. Press Escape to restart the level if you get stuck.</li></ul>\r\nLet's see what these testimonials said about the game:\r\n<p>(quotes translated to English)</p>\n<ul><li>This is it! World's greatest creation! ~Me</li><li>Completely unplayable ~My brother\u00a0said in real life</li><li>The game looks so simple but is bloody challenging!!! ~Selmais wrote on r/playmygame</li><li>Pretty good ~Sygan said in real life</li><li>I passed 3 levels\u00a0~Kajtek\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Facebook</li><li>Wow, it's cool\u00a0~Pako wrote on Facebook</li></ul>\r\nGameplay Time:\r\n<p>For a skilled player it takes around 20-40 minutes to finish all levels.</p>\n<p>For a newcomer\u00a0it will take much longer. It may take 20-40 minutes to complete a single level (above level 3, because levels 1, 2, 3 are very short).</p>\n<p>In the game there are multiple hidden levels, to which you can go to by finding hidden portals. You can find text clues in the game on how to get to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I played the game for like 30 hours. :D (this number is not up to date\u00a0 since I play it more than I should)</p>\r\nImplementation:\r\n<p>There are currently 10 levels. I will make some more.\u00a0Most of the features are done, but I need to finalize some things here and there.\u00a0There is no sound in the game yet. Game also needs a little bit of polishing. For now works best on 16:9 ratio, 4:3 is bugged. <strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>New version is now on Android in the Play Store. It has a new level and some improvements. Also you can unlock Achievements on Android.</p>\r\nHave fun!\r\n<p>If you have fun, share link to this game\u00a0with a friend. Thank you! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41062eefdbd7552d91c47c2a992a626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tymski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
