Much like it's <strong>predecessor</strong>, it encourages you to play with all the elements you come across to create new life that will inhibit the large open environment. The landscape is filled with many mysterious locations and ancient ruins to discover, much of which hold secrets to be uncovered as you progress. As new life finds its way to the world, more can be learned about the strange beings that once lived there!</p>\n<p>Much of the game is yet to be created so this demo features simple exploration and the flora and fauna will be added in as we progress.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>\"WASD\" to move around</li><li>\"Shift\" to move around faster</li><li>\"Esc\" will close the game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b887a1f3d67f08714d355b1593b6fc3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["acornbringer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
