I made this game alone, but I'm still only a beginner for the graphics so I'm sorry if they're not great.\u00a0 I still used music from:\u00a0 Songs from an unmade forest world 1 and 2 by Visager. As well as smalls\u00a0 free UI packs from Kenney and Hyohnoo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I chose the slimes as the character for this theme because when they are alone they are weak but when they join forces they become invincible so it seemed normal to me to choose them for this theme!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy playing my game the way I did when I created it. ( And that it won't be too buggy too).
