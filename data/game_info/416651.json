In the end, the game was not completed because: 1- I didn't have a story or storyline; 2- I didn't know which mechanics include; 3- I was learning programming while developing; 4- I didn't know what to do with the game; 5- I knew what it was like to make a GDD. Now, with a little more structure, I would say that I intend to recover all the characters and use them in a future game.</p>\n<p>I decided to publish here for anyone who serves as an incentive to anyone. Creating games is possible!
