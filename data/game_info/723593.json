Here at last is the answer to that problem, the Gacha Game Simulator! It's a bit of a prototype, but it works fairly well anyways!<br/></p>\n<p>This was made with HTML and Javascript (and a bit of CSS to keep all the pages in a sort of Dark Mode). It's fairly basic, just some pages where you can click on a button to get random characters. This is purely the actual gacha part of a gacha game, unfortunately there's nothing to actually do with the characters you get. But hey, you can get them!</p>\n<p>Normally, a gacha game requires you to spend a certain amount of in-game currency for each pull. For this simulator, each pull is completely free! Though I would recommend not clicking the buttons too quickly due to potential loading issues.<br/></p>\n<p>There's also a gallery so you can view the characters without needing to go through the gacha pulls!</p>\n\n<p>Possible future updates to this prototype:</p>\n<ul><li>Current probabilities are 10% for Gold Rank, 20% for Silver Rank, and 70% for Bronze Rank. In the banners, it's 7% for the banner character, 3% for the remaining Gold Rank characters, and then the same probabilities as before for the other two ranks. I should probably have these probabilities listed in the actual pages at some point.</li><li>I may add in a \"currency\" of sorts in the future, but how that would  work is just another button to generate a random number of the currency,  and then you can go spend it on pulls until you run out. So still  basically free.</li><li>If I do add the above feature, I will probably also add a  tracker for how much you've spent on pulls, and possibly track which  characters you've gotten so far and how many of each.</li><li>Maybe reorganize the layout so that it looks nicer? I would probably save this for later since it'd be only a visual change.</li><li>Then finally at some point make the code available as a download to let people make their own gacha simulators with different images and stuff!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b103edc635b52d62875a2b9c9e0328b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DragonMarquise"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
