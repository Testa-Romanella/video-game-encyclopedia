Unfortunately, the new engine seemed to have bugs in it or didn't give a full understanding of a couple things. The code broke in a few places while not in others and we aren't sure why. Such as The same object being instantiated over and over (enemy ships *cough cough*) should all act the same other than ship speed. However, the ray cast for the shooting\u00a0doesn't pick up some of them, and we don't know why haha<br/></p>\n<p>We also wanted to add a few more things but lacked the time at the end =(</p>\n<p>Might still update though!</p>\n<p><strong>Nevertheless, we hope you enjoy our first released game!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>**Side note**If the Main .exe doesn't work for you, try the V1.1!
