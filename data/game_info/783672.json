They must use their musical abilities to knock out their opponent to grace the stage and take advantage of their time to shine.<br/></p>\n<p>Exciting gameplay involves rushing the stage, knocking out opponents, and using the small snippets of time to grace the audience with the player\u2019s talent. However, stay on the stage too long and the player will likely be targeted and sent back to their corner of the arena. Players can use power-ups and well-timed attacks to make their move against their rival musicians and buy as much time on stage as possible.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T14:36:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14ddbe51556dde91dd68fd0c481fe009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dmskolnick", "whitedr1", "GabyBendtsen", "Zonkey_Beans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
