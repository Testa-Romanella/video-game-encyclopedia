It is a zero-player game, which means it is determined by only its initial state.\u00a0 The standard rules are: a cell is born if it has 3 neighbors (from a total of 8 adjacent cells) and survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors. Since the game's creation, many other rules were investigated, composing what today is the family of life-like cellular automata (there are 262,144 possible rules). The original game of life is Turing complete, so it can harbor universal computation and also self-replicating entities. It is a beautiful example of a minimal system capable of sustaining life-like organisms, yielding great complexity and (strong) unpredictability in a deterministic and substrate-agnostic setting.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Left-click the grid to breed cells and right-click to kill them. You can experiment with colors, patterns, different rules, and change variables on the fly. The game has an infinite size in theory, and interesting patterns can be incredibly large; this software presents a small 50x50 grid sample of the game, intended as an art toy, featuring its microlevel (with boundaries interaction).</p>\n\n<p>Learn more:</p>\n<p>https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed7/ed791f0e9cd81e967f036a22175d1e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lr.gui"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
