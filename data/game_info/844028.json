In this 2D-Platformer, Jump'n'Run, you play an infant race that emerges in the ruins of a lost civilization and searches for a safe place to life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is not a single hero mission, it is part of a generational journey of exploring and adaptation. Whenever the played character dies, you can choose a new kinfolk that evolved to be more fitting to the challenge.</p>\n<p>If the mission failed, because they weren't fast enough, then the next one will be. If they couldn't jump high enough, then their ancestors grew\u00a0a stronger tail to catapult them into the sky. If they don't have the right tools for the job, then natural selection will help them out by forming their bodies to fit the task.<br/>This is the morbid, but crucial way of nature in \"Survival of the Next\", but the fundamentals for a unique Platforming experience.<br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>, <strong>D</strong> - Move left and Right</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Jump<br/>- Glide in the AIr</p>\n<p><strong>LMB</strong> - Shoot<br/>\u00a0- Aim with <strong>W</strong>, <strong>A</strong>,<strong> S</strong>, <strong>D</strong> while Shooting</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This game was created in 72 hours as submission of the \"Alpha Summer Gamejam 2022\" and with the theme \"Evolution\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T17:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8ee2444ebc6fa51530593b8738cc9aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kuay", "Ibrahim K.", "MarchTales", "Lyred", "Vulnerius"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
