Whisper commands, supplant his thoughts and direct his actions.<br/><br/>YOU decide if he lives or dies, succeeds or fails, but always remember: the human you are inhabiting is not a character made of pixels that you can use and discard without applying a moral compass. He is a real person living his life in a parallel universe who is at first unaware of our presence in his mind. It may be your whim to toss his life to the winds, but as you read about his demise in text form, somewhere out there a real man bleeds to death in the dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Robert Jenkins:</strong> The man you will be inhabiting, Jenkins is the mission lead as recommended by Colin Wheats. Canadian military background, but since the Wars he has worked off and on under various roles for the Global Senate. Jenkins is married with no children, and finds himself feeling significantly out of his depth going into this mission.<br/><br/><strong>Colin Wheats:</strong>  Supposedly an American-born, former Mi6 operative. During the Wars, he was usually found deep undercover, but since then he's made a home for himself as the top Asia-Pacific specialist for the Global Senate. His ties to remaining military forces in the region gives him a geopolitical advantage, often resulting in gaining access to situations even before government leaders do.<br/><br/><strong>Eliska Soltz:</strong>  Ex-Israeli Special Forces, specializing in recon and technological infiltration. Contracted by the Global Senate specifically for this mission and is the only member without any previous ties to the organization. She is known to be a little volatile at the best of times and is immediately suspicious of Jenkins\u2019 role in the mission.<br/><br/><strong>Jiang Shi:</strong>  The most mysterious member of the team, but also its most important. A Chinese national, currently exiled from her homeland due to her involvement in a supposedly botched infiltration mission while working for the Global Senate. Jiang has intimate knowledge of the super-weapon in question and intends to help disable it once and for all.<br/><br/><strong>Philip Lancaster:</strong> On the surface, Lancaster is a political functionary who is, for all intents and purposes, the mission\u2019s \u201chandler.\u201d Spy by nature, his true nationality is unknown and the vast majority of information on his work has been mostly redacted or buried by the powers that be. With a happy go lucky personality, Lancaster has been known to say that life is like a video game that should be played until all of its potential secrets and achievements have been found.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 350,000+ word interactive novel that uses close to 100 global variables, creating a replayable narrative that is unique to YOUR choices.<br/>\u200b<br/>\u2022 Over 100 unique endings, including deaths, successes and failures.
