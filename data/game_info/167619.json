Students and advisors had no prior knowledge of Leap Motion, Unity, PlayMaker, or 3D game design.</p><p>The team completed the project at the West Tisbury School during 1 full day and 3 half days when school was not in session for professional development and parent-teacher conferences, and a few 1-2 hour small group sessions.... at times when, the students report, they could have been at home relaxing and playing... :-)  We all think the effort and sacrifice were worth it, and hope you'll agree.  </p><p>We thank everyone for their input, and hope you like the game.</p><p><strong>Our Inspiration</strong></p><p>We're excited about the future of technology, especially VR / AR, in part inspired by a trip some of us made off of our small island to a VR / AR Meetup in Cambridge, MA.  Thanks so much to the Leap Motion team for your hospitality, generosity, and patience in demoing the capabilities of the Leap Motion Controllers!  We hope this project is just the start, and that we can next explore developing in VR / AR!</p><p><strong>KEY LEARNINGS:</strong></p><p>Navigation &amp; Experimentation with Unity and PlayMaker by Hutong Games</p><p>Leap Motion Controller &amp; SDK (esp. for Widgets)</p><p>Game Object Management, including Destroy Self</p><p>Parent / Child Relationships</p><p>Prefabs and Instances</p><p>Transforms - Position, Rotation, Scale on 3 Axes</p><p>Vector 3 Variables and Management</p><p>Physics Engine / Application of Force and Bounce</p><p>Collisions and Tagging</p><p>Camera Management</p><p>Basic Animation</p><p>Finite State Machines</p><p>Random Number Generation and Management</p><p>Conditional Logic</p><p>Creating In-Game Objects</p><p>Creating, Manipulating, and Using Local and Global Variables</p><p>Passing Variables Information between Leap Motion C# Scripts and Unity / PlayMaker</p><p>Creating, Managing and Invoking Events, including across Game Objects</p><p>Converting Floats and Integers, including into Strings</p><p>Building and Displaying Strings from Collections of Strings and from Variables</p><p>Game Assets Management</p><p>Audio - Including Sampling, Importing, Conditional Play, Volume Optimization, Looping</p><p>Particle Effects</p><p>Scene Design &amp; Transitions</p><p>Lighting - Placement, Optimization</p><p><strong>TOOLS USED:</strong></p><p>Leap Motion Controllers &amp; SDK</p><p>Unity for Mac</p><p>PlayMaker by Hutong Games</p><p>Agile Board hosted by Trello.com</p><p>Coggle.it Mind Maps</p><p><strong>THANKS TO:</strong></p><p><strong>Leap Motion, Inc.</strong></p><p>for Leap Motion Controllers and fabulous support!</p><p><strong>Unity Technologies</strong></p><p>for educational licenses, Simple Particle Pack, and support.</p><p><strong>Teachers, Parents, &amp; High School Mentors</strong></p><p>David Crawford</p><p>Derek Fairchild-Coppoletti</p><p>Jack Rizza (MV Public Charter School)</p><p>Christopher Aring (MV Regional High School)</p><p>Harrison Dorr (MV Regional High School)</p><p>Curtis Fisher (MV Regional High School)</p><p><strong>STUDENT TEAM (Grade)</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Assets Team</strong></p><p>Delilah Hammarlund (6th)</p><p>Latham Higgins (6th)</p><p>BJ Mullen (6th)</p><p>Wilson Riley (8th)</p><p>Elias Saunier (6th)</p><p><strong>Coding Team</strong></p><p>Sebastian Alexander (5th)</p><p>Daniel Bonneau (8th)</p><p>Oliver Dorr (6th)</p><p>Theo Fairchild-Coppoletti (6th)</p><p>Abigail Hammarlund (8th)</p><p><strong>Controls Team</strong></p><p>Samuel Stone Benjamin (6th)</p><p>Jack Crawford (5th)</p><p>Hardy Eville (6th)</p><p>Tate Fairchild-Coppoletti (4th)</p><p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO:</strong></p><p>Alan Mahoney for lending us the computer lab.</p><p>Principal Donna Lowell-Bettencourt,</p><p>Assistant Principal Mary Boyd, &amp;</p><p>The Faculty &amp; Staff of the West Tisbury School</p><p>chaoticcoders.org</p><p>FreeSound.org:</p><p>Fire Alarm.wav by payattention</p><p>Childrens' Classroom by abcopen</p><p>Pencil Eraser.wav by esperri</p><p>Book_Heavy_Noise.wav by donjmyers</p><p>Hitting baseball w. wooden bat.wav by CGEffex</p><p>www.jamendo.com: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0</p><p>Artist: Den makes music; Song: Copier, coller, danser; Album: Chim\u00e8re</p><p>Baseball Asset = http://u3d.as/cwA</p><p>Classroom Props Assets = http://u3d.as/9qm &amp; http://u3d.as/3Ps</p><p>www.wtisburyschool.org</p><p>West Tisbury, MA</p><p>Martha's Vineyard Public Schools</p><p>http://mvyps.org</p><p>All Rights Reserved</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a1e57b14756979a9ef1e13a665b750a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["West Tisbury School"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
