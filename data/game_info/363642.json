You\u2019ll want a rough-hewn table cut from a single length of ironwood, set before a roaring fire in a boisterous mead-hall, with mugs of ale and meat off the spit close at hand. Or, someone\u2019s basement. Nominate one among you to be the SWINESCHAL: it is their responsibility to present a tale of high adventure. The others take on the role of HOGBEARERS: proud and upright defenders of hogkind.</p>\n\n<p>---<br/></p>\n\n<p>Layout and Design by Dee Pennyway:\u00a0https://deepennyway.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f15398f9f3749988c1b126cccbcb78de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monkey's Paw Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
