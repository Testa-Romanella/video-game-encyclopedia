There is no end, so play till you found all 7! We originally had bigger plans, but 3 members dropped out sadly.</p>\n<p>*Note: Once upon a time, there were seven planned cocktails for the player to obtain. Unfortunately for players of Dwarf Fortress, Dwarven Wine is unobtainable due to a developer oopsie. The recipe was supposed to be plump helmet juice + wine, but... we forgot to add wine to the game... So plump helments are useless... As are glowberries...<br/></p>\n<p>**************************************************************************************<br/></p>\n<p>Ingredients are held by enemies or scattered around the dungeon. Defeat the spiders to claim them!<br/></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - Movement</p>\n<p>Spacebar/Left Click - Attack</p>\n<p>Tab/I - Inventory</p>\n<p>To use appliances, simply walk up to them and click the items you would like to input. The machine will take a bit to process them and produce an output item.</p>\n<p>A few tips:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Order doesn\u2019t matter with mixtures</li><li>You don\u2019t need to find common alcohols</li><li>If an item isn\u2019t found on the ground, you have to kill an enemy to get it!</li></ul>\n<p>Psst! If you don't want to perform trial-and-error for all the cocktail recipes, here's a list of all the obtainable drinks.
