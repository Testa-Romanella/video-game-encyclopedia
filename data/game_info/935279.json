I wanted to explore climbing as a mechanic, and decided to have players climb a mountain to explore mysterious ruins.</p>\n<p>The project taught me a lot about developing in VR and level design iteration. I spent a lot of time ironing out repetitive motions and create segments that were both challenging but not exhausting the player.</p>\n<p>This project is envisioned as part of a wider gameplay experience, and I will be returning to it when I have levelled up my skills a bit so that I can achieve my original vision!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T12:39:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/75084b274f2f7020cea3d6f76dcc7f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Graithen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
