Levels get more and more challenging as you advance!</p><p>Note that the blocks you spawn can both fail the level if hitting a bomb and pass it if at the end!</p>\n<p>You can launch yourself in a certain direction by using WASD/Space or you can launch yourself randomly by using LMB.</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>beta3.15</strong>, you have access to 21 different levels grouped into 3 scenes:</p>\n<ul><li>Scene 1: The Basics (10 levels)</li><li>Scene 2: Into the sky (10 levels)</li><li>Scene 3: Aura (1 level)</li></ul>\n<p>The game is optimized and should work perfectly fine even on old setups. If any problems appear regarding performance, you can use the configuration panel that shows up before playing and try lowing down the graphics quality or resolution.</p>\n<p>Found any bugs? Have any ideas or suggestions? The discussion board is open and you can even suggest stuff or new level ideas!</p>\n<p>The game is currently only available for Windows, but a Mac version will appear very soon.</p>\n<p>Good luck! (try not to rage ;))</p><p>Awesome people that helped me:</p><p>- Brackeys' Camera Shake tutorial (at the end of levels)</p><p>- Sydew helped with the idea</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4c1c1a2d1c8f9191e9a0e47c7cc395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EzRel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
