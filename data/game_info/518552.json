In this co-op game, each player drives a tank. You goal is to pick up the balls that are scattered around the field and fire them at the moving target. Every time you hit the target, obstacles fall onto your opponents side of the field, which takes up space. You win when you cover your opponent's field with balls, thus, they ran out of space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T07:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/919/919ed42c6269345ef1b8edb58b3e63ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dante Xystus", "Wooshie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
