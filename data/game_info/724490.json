Forecast comes as a set of six double sided cards. It's designed to be randomless, but you can dice if you wish. Each card fits onto a 3x5-inch index card. If your group is exploring one area together, just one card is needed on the table. If your characters are in different places you can use multiple cards.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSetup<br/><p><strong>You will need:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 six tokens.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 (optional) a six-sided die.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 (optional) one coin.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>SETUP</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At the start of the day lay the six forecast cards in front of you. \r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>Choose a card, then choose either side.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>For a random result roll 1d6, then flip one coin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nPlaying The Game\r\n<p><strong>PLAY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At each stage of the day place a token over a weather condition. \r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>Discard the card once all boxes are filled. \r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>You may use the card's reverse to track the night's weather.</p>\r\n\r\nExtending The System<br/>\n<p>Forecast is part of a series of tools designed to mechanise asynchronous narrative play - that is, one table's players and characters can be in different places or times.</p><p>Watchkeepcan\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0directly\u00a0with\u00a0Forecast\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0means\u00a0to\u00a0track\u00a0the\u00a0stages\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0day.</p><p>Key &amp; Token provides additional context for creating scenes and playing keywords in a scene. It comes with a simple character sheet. <br/></p><p>Marauder is a tool to create  point-crawl adventures and map networks of relationships. It doesn't  plot the actual, real-world position of a narrative focus, though you  can indicate things like distance.\r\n</p>\n<p>Marauder  uses the terms Vertices, Edges, and Weights. This terminology is  borrowed from Graph Theory, but generally, people would refer to these  as 'nodes'.\r\n</p>\n<p>A narrative focus can  be anything from a location, to a person or to an object. In play, you  move character tokens between points on the map and interact with them  through roleplay.\r\n</p><p>Myriad is a randomless narrative oracle system. Use it when playing GM-less, narrative games.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n<p>You are free to:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Share </strong>\u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Adapt </strong>- remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.<br/></p>\n<p>Under the following terms:</p>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong> \u2014 You must give appropriate credit.
