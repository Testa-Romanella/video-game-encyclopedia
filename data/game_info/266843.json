The door flew open and the test subject began firing at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 blood all over from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 shots, covering up the survailence cameras. The screams stopped.</p>\n<p>Immidietly the emergency doors shut to try to keep the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at bay while getting personel out of the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588 minutes pass, still no sound, one research team was sent out to investigate.</p>\n<p>Camera was checked for live footage, directly after they left. The screen was a pale white face with scars and blood all over it presumably the creature. The\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was climbing on the walls staring at the camera.<br/>Conclusion if mask is worn, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will come after it's location. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 like a beacon. Then monster will return the mask to it's original position.</p>\n\n<p><em>Programmer: Isak Dalberg</em></p>\n<p><em>Sound design: Oscar\u00a0Nyberg</em></p>\n<p><em>Music: Mathieu Keith\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/8665d328de129885012079cec114f6d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dulberg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
