What\u2019s <em>even worse</em>? You have to keep doing it. <em>Dead-cold Brew</em> is a game about Beau, a ghost that worked itself to death, and keeps on going even after dying because they can\u2019t go to the other side with unfinished business. Business meaning customers, coffee and cute-named pastries! Manage your time -- <em>and your will to live!</em> -- while serving people that can\u2019t seem to notice that you\u2019re not exactly alive.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nThis game was made for the Halloween Jam 2021 by:\r\nErick Salvador (@nanana_na_nashi): 3D Artist<br/>Jadhy Scott (@jaajaaj_): 2D and UI Artist<br/>JP Malheiros (@JPdotPNG): Writer and Game Designer<br/>Pedro Henrique Labrador: Audio Designer<br/>Thiago Correia Amaro (@thiagaramo): Programmer\r\nFonts from Dafont by NeutroneLabs and Putracetol Studio<br/>Some audios are from freesound.org and mixkit.co", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T09:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a56e10ad5f91d66afb8da604fde1432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thiago Amaro", "jaajaaj", "Pedro Labrador", "JPdotPNG", "nanana_na_nashi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
