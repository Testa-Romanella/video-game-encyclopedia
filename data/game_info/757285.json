Each one beckons a different clue as to the way out. Is there such a place? It seems I've been here forever, and nature has too: trees grow and rivers flow here. And an ever-present moon showers the space with light. Every wonder it seems has a secret to share\u2026\"</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>You find yourself in an internal space full of staircases and platforms. But there seems to be no way out. Three different rooms interconnect by floating balconies. But some can only be accessed in another life...\u00a0 Along the way in the different rooms, you notice three wonders you can interact with. Each puzzle leads to a key but you will need to rely on your past life to make your way out...</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>N.B. There are meant to be banisters surrounding the paths around the level, but I didn't leave enough time to add them all in ;P</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>This game was created for GJL Game Parade Summer 2022.
