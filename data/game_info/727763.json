Work in progress !\r\n\r\nThe game is in its early stages, there are only concepts and programming research for now. This will evolve when I have the time to dedicate myself to it.\u00a0\r\nWhat there is was done some time ago.\r\nThe ultimate goal being to achieve a usable and completely finished game.\r\n\r\nThe game is a ghost simulator. We embody a spirit and we move like the camera in management games. Our goal is to interact with the elements present in front of us to try to scare the residents and scare them away from their homes.\r\nThe current game contains a prototype of movement and interactions with objects, as well as a random spawn of objects and characters. I removed the displacements of certain AI because they were not very to the point.\r\nYou can move with the keyboard and rotate the camera with the right mouse click\r\n\r\nBlueprint programming in UE4", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2f854eaafe7f74f4bf534e3b072d10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphael Lecocq"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
