We were inspired by the aesthetics of David Lynch and Gaspard Noe films. The goal of the game is to open your mind and check your skills. This is an opportunity to be in a dream in reality. Play it and feel the world of colors in a new way.</p>\n<p>We have set difficult obstacles and invite you to compete in the high-speed passage of our game. Share with us in the comments how much time it took you to complete the game. The time counter will be displayed at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>For Weekly Game Jam 148.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>A New Way by Lesion X | https://soundcloud.com/lesionxbeats<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b9/1b90b11466af650bc4648164f96331a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flurescein", "Yana"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
