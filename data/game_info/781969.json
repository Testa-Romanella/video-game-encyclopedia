Control the movement of the gorilla with A (left), D (right), and W/Space (jump). You can jump off of walls and platforms by pressing W when the gorilla is up against them while jumping. Avoid obstacles (water, cacti) and use platforms (birds) to your advantage!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:20:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c24c5c9638afada5bac26282eba15229.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["burge337"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
