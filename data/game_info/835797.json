This makes adding more content very easy. But for the next one, I should add a better spawning script that is more easily editable and that doesn't wait for a set amount of time to tell the player that they have won.</p>\n<p>Also, for Touhou fans, this game should be very easy, because I needed to complete the game myself for testing so I have a lot of free buffs to the player at the start - back shooters, kill to heal and heal over max health.<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in less than ~12h (stopped keeping track on the 2nd day) over the course of 2 days as a  part  of my   own declared challenge: One Day Jam (kinda failed the  one-day part, jet again). The goal of ODJ is to  create a   simple game in one day  with a time  budget of 8-9h. I failed this time, again :).<br/></p>\n<p>Extra rules for ODJ that I follow:        </p>\n<ul><li>One scene - no multiple levels, just one screen;   \r\n</li><li>No music, sound, effects, options - this saves time and I'm lazy;   \r\n</li><li>Very simple game idea - simple enough to port to mobile without adding onscreen joysticks and button clusters; \r\n</li><li>Use Unity or any high-level game engine - saves a bit of time :)   \r\n</li></ul>\n<p> This is my 7th ODJ and I  plan to do more of these. That's why this one is dated 12.08. <br/></p>\n<p>The 8th will probably be a sequel to this with more campaigns, enemies and \"power ups\" (maybe).<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c52ba5ed35f2d6b3863c2819addc01cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CRA Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
