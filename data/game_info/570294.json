With this immense power come immense <strong>side-effects</strong>, as the player can only open the build-menu a limited amount of times in play-mode, which is set in the level creator.</p>\n\r\n--Controls--\r\n\n\n<p>Are you happy with what you've created? A challenging puzzle level, a traditional fast-paced stage or something else entirely? Show it to the world by uploading it online (no modem required) or save it as a file to send it to a friend! <br/></p>\n<p>And when you're done with creating, you can play other people's creations!</p>\n\n\n<p>The Limitations that I tried to follow are screen resolution, button count and sound capabilities.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by me and <strong>lenscas</strong> in a span of a week for the <strong>Retro Game Jam 2021</strong>.
