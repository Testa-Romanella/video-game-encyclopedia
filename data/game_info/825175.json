Best part is that all you need to do is play a fun crane game! Catch as many prizes as you can each day, and sell them to make enough money to feed yourself. It may not be easy to literally eat, sleep, and play at the crane day in, and day out, but certainly it's better than just being left to die.</p>\n<p>Catching prizes is easy! Just line up the crane with the center of your target prize as best as you can. The more accurate you are, the more likely the crane will hang on to the prize long enough for you to win it! Each time you attempt to grab will cost you a Coin though, so make sure you're ready before pressing the button.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how long you survive much you enjoy the Craniac life!</p>\n\n<p>Brick texture courtesy Publicdomaintextures on Sketchfab<br/>https://publicdomaintextures.com/elementor-112/bricks07/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T20:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7b1611f905b3b70652c932276b5d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neon Pie Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
