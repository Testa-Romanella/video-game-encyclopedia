It turned out that the powerful artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0 that was created at this station got out of control. AI controls the entire station and almost all equipment. Only one experimental (unfinished)\u00a0 of the robot, the AI could not completely block. A software scientist named John, bypassing AI locks, was able to partially take control of this experimental robot. The limited control of the robot lies in the fact that the robot can be fed only one control signal that switches the modes of operation of the robot. <br/>The robot switches in the following sequence = \"no movement\" ---- \"movement\" ---- \"flight\". <br/>With the help of this robot, John decided to stop the AI - for this you need to get to the manual emergency power outages of AI systems. To get to the emergency shutdown, you need to go through several compartments of the station. <br/>To open the transition to the next level, you need to collect all the energy batteries. Of course the AI will try to stop you so be prepared for surprises.</p>\n<p>The game has 10 levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0631130c9e33a5a0841d04f7435415.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metamorpho_SG"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
