{"id": 53818, "slug": "fire-n-ice", "name": "Fire 'n Ice", "name_original": "Fire 'n Ice", "description": "<p>Fire &#39;n Ice is a puzzle game released by Tecmo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the prequel to Solomon&#39;s Key, and is known as Solomon&#39;s Key 2 in Europe and Solomon no Kagi 2: Coolmintou Kyuushutsu Sakusen (Solomon&#39;s Key 2: Coolmint Rescue Mission) in Japan. The aim of the game involves players extinguishing all fires in a level in order to proceed. They do this by creating and melting ice or kicking ice onto the fires. This game also has a level editor (which may expose some bugs that substantially affect the game mechanics), but only the Japanese version permits saving the levels one creates.<br />\nAn unofficial conversion for Russian ZX Spectrum clones was made in 2003. It uses the plot and levels from the original game, but with remade graphics that adhere to platform limitations and music taken from the game Kuru Kuru Kururin. In 2015, another unofficial conversion was released, for the Commodore Amiga.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-07T12:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/68a/68a60121de0a9ebf3868fd1f63b5aea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Tecmo"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
