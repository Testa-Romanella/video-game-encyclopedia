I was literally doing the space shooter demo on day 1 of the jam lol. Anyway, RUSHED to get this out, and learned a lot about ct.js. It's an amazing little game engine, but I got hung up on things a lot. I think it's worth to contribute to the ct.js project. I am\u00a0really impressed with it.</p><p>(I am missing something to make it work with touch/mobile.
