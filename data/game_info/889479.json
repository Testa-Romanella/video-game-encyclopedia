All sounds included were pulled direct from multitrack sources publicly available online.\u00a0<strong>Please note that the BPM is not 100% perfect all the time - this is a toy, not a professional music tool!!</strong></p>\n<p>If you enjoy this project, check out my &amp;\u00a0Jay Tholen's latest work Hypnospace Outlaw, and keep an eye out for the sequel Dreamsettler!</p>\n\n<p><em>This project was uploaded for archival/historical purposes, it is Windows only and will likely never be updated.\u00a0There used to also be iOS and Android app versions of this project, but they are so old they've been removed or hidden from the app stores - the Android version might be added at some point.\u00a0Also\u00a0I may update this page later to look more professional, but this is what you've got for now, enjoy!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32f/32fae1fe27405fc62a3c0e05ec3a3ac2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TetroniMike"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
