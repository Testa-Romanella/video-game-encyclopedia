An augmented reality game based on the fun activity we have all played in our homes and outdoor spaces in the past, now available on your iPhone.<br/>A free to play family interactive game promoting activity (indoors and outdoors) collecting fruits (promoting healthy eating) and avoiding the Lava to save your \u201dlife\u201d. It\u2019s time to get moving and play!<br/>The aim of the game is to get the highest score. Everyone wins as every game is created by you! You can make it as hard or as easy as you want. Challenge your friends. Each game is created differently, each time. And, you get more points for gaming outdoors!<br/>Family interaction - it gets everyone working together, creating games for each other at the same time. Exercising with activity, reaching the (healthy) fruits with the additional challenge of avoiding the lava as you do it. Ideal interaction actvity between less abled people too!<br/>Easy to play<br/>You create a personal profile with a picture from your own collection or using the phone\u2019s camera. You can then create a game for yourself (or someone else) to play. Games can be played anywhere (a room, a garden, a local park, an outdoor play area, etc.) You then set the 3D lava flow area (as many or as few as you want). These are set on the floor or ground of the area you are playing in. You then place 3D fruits (apples, strawberries, bananas or oranges) into the gaming space. You can choose indoor or outdoor games with outdoor games being rewarded by extra points. The 3D fruits are visible on screen when facing the right direction. Be careful not to step into the lava!<br/>All fruits must be collected from the game whilst avoiding the lava. Stepping into the lava reduces one \u201dlife\u201d. You have three \u201dlives\u201d at the start of each game. \u201dLives\u201d can be restored by collecting the fruits. Games can be saved and you can choose between these or to create a new game or even compare between each other. No limits to the number of levels you can create.<br/>No In App purchases. What you pay for is what you get. Simple!<br/>Lava AR was developed by ARCKIT, a new and exciting game development company who have more games coming.
