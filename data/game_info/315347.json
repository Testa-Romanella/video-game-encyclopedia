The high priestess of Tressia shall vindicate her fallen civilization by transforming the very life of her enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>TRIWAR</strong> can be played in the browser using keyboard+mouse (highly recommended), mouse-only or with touch devices.</p>\n<p>The game was coded in pure Javascript ES6 (so no Internet explorer, sorry). An interesting sidenote: This is the first game I've made which is completely devoid of graphical assets. Everything in the game is rendered through Javascript as 2D shapes. As a result this game will render crisply at any resolution.</p>\n<p>Another tidbit: The AI in this game was based on a boids-like model, with each unit type having its own rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d210b08531027d6a5dee6fd7ca7e55f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donitz"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
