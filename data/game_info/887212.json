There's all sorts of <em>currency </em>out there! Lucky for you, an industrialist korat has set up a boat shop, and you've got just enough money to get started. Unfortunately, though, their boats have a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to leaks...</p>\n<p>Can you master the steering before your boat falls apart? Or at least, can you find enough coins out on the water to turn a profit? Can you figure out which combination of sails, motor, and hull will get you the furthest? And if you get shipwrecked in the middle of nowhere, do you trust in your swimming skills enough to make it home? Even with a giant jellyfish pursuing you?</p>\n<p>Well, even if you screw it all up, you can always work at the Puzzle Warehouse until you've got enough money to sail again.<br/><br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Press F at any time to toggle fullscreen.<br/></p>\n<p>While on the sea:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Hold Up to accelerate. Let go of Up to stop accelerating!</li><li>Hold Left or Right to turn.</li><li>Press Space to jump.</li><li>Alternate between A and D to paddle (you'll know when.)</li></ul>\n<p>While on the island:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to select boat parts and purchase valuable items.</li><li>In the Puzzle Warehouse, use the mouse to drag boxes. Drag the red box to the exit to complete the level!</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>The island's background artwork is Calm Sea by Gustave Corbet (1886).</li><li>The ocean map was created using Mapgen4 by Red Blob Games.</li><li>All other artwork is done by me and it shows.</li><li>The boat shop's background music is a .ptcop remix of Black Market from Shin Megami Tensei IV. Thank you to Blancblack Studios for making the MIDI file that this arrangement uses as a base.</li><li>Likewise, the Puzzle Warehouse song is a .ptcop remix of Ashura-Kai Authorized Shop from Shin Megami Tensei IV.</li><li>The sound effects come from Cave Story and Anodyne.</li><li>The Puzzle Warehouse uses puzzles sourced from Michael Fogleman's Rush Hour dataset.</li><li>The boat shop is lifted straight out of 1998 edutainment game The Cluefinders 4th Grade Adventures. I'm still not sure what math or English lesson I was supposed to learn from this sequence.</li><li>Finally, the game title comes from bluegrass classic Darling Nellie Across the Sea as performed by Hazel Dickens. I recommend it while sailing in this game!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T10:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6cce17fce6ddb29be5c4b8f542404a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hazely"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
