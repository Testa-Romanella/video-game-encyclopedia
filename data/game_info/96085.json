One minute it\u2019s your birthday, the next your Papa is being stolen from you right before your eyes! Thrust into the role of adventurer, when all you\u2019d rather be doing is opening presents, you quickly realise that you are a natural at this baddie-bashing, grapple-swinging, toaster-popping, quest-completing, experience-leveling, treasure-seeking malarky. But will you be able to rescue your Papa and stop Mr B\u2019s diabolical plans in time?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sparkles The Giraffe</strong></p>\n<p>Friend. Philosopher. MENSA member. Giraffe. Sparkles has many talents beyond being a mere mount. Use her not-at-all-creepy helicopter-like tongue to slow and direct your fall, or her long neck to yank yourself to distant enemies for devastating combo finishers, or up to those hard-to-reach platforms to y\u2019know... jump higher</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mr. Rock</strong></p>\n<p>When you need somebody sturdy you can lean on for support, call Mr. Rock, because, well... he's a literal rock. Maybe he's a bit of a smart-aleck, but don't take him for granite... you\u2019ll discover he has some pretty awesome abilities to unlock as you adventure through the game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7627e9571cd4bec62abc86bc6cd5ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Armor Games Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
