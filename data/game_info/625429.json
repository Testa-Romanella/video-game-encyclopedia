GEEZ! 3 hours are just too tense so I failed DX</p>\n<p>I'm more of a programmer, but I also did the visuals and music by myself this time. It costs me about 4.5 hours to finish this one.\u00a0I'll try harder next time!\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>1.Move your mouse so you can hear the NOISE within all the signals.</p>\n<p>2.Click on the <strong>ONLY ONE\u00a0NOISE\u00a0</strong>signal to kill it. (You should avoid clicking on other signals).</p>\n<p>3.You can always use Right Mouseclick to restart the game.<br/></p>\r\nWhat's else\r\n<p>Clicking might not be very accurate. Didn't have time to fix that.</p>\n<p>HTML5 is a disaster on audio spatial blend.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b8f43875bedd6015be5a5351f463e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Decappoolla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
