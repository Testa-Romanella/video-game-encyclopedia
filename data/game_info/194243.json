To navigate levels, WASD moves the character, shift enables sprinting, and spacebar is used to jump.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/8608282d7a563b778c25d627b617428b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cjshaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
