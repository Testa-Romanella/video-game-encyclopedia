Well thats actually your screen resolution. You die when its just one pixel.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Theres no inventory either, you just carry one item. (Which can be stolen from you) But you can befriend other creatures and build an army. Your family is kinda like your inventory.<br/>It's a new kind of survival.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>All this design and engine coding has taken me two years, yet it still aint complete.<br/>So I decided to sell it in beta but kinda cheap.<br/>Temporary price of 12 and not 24 dollars.<br/>With free updates forever of course.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I'll forever update because Nature Gaze is the meaning of my life.<br/>Even if this doesn't sell well, I havent failed, because this is my personal paradise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T17:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d7d7faa99ad7bc597254e9141bd9e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nate Churman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
