{"id": 548106, "slug": "skeleton-king-2", "name": "Skeleton King", "name_original": "Skeleton King", "description": "Under the full moon's light of Halloween, a skeleton decides to grab fate by the bones and become nobility - the hard way. After all, if you collect every single crown in the crypt, you ARE the Skeleton King!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLose yourself in this relaxing, realistic runner while realizing it's really about a restless reliquary that's actually rather scary, due to the animated skeletons of course. To be honest it's not a bad excuse for a Halloween game that's eerily realistic looking.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNo soundtrack included, you're supposed to load up your favorite tune(s) to blast while you reach for the top score ever. There's still sound for things like running into obstacles and collecting crowns.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour character gets faster as the games goes on, can slowly regenerate \"health\", and dies when you run out. Obstacles remove a single hit point, while enemy skeletons cost you 10.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse Left and Right keys (or A and D) to move left and right. Near the Knights, TAP left/right (or A/D) to turn. Don't turn too late or you'll crash!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T03:17:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a2ed85bd8abf41998a81029ae1ab81a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Forbidden Knowledge"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forbidden Knowledge"], "esrb_rating": null}
