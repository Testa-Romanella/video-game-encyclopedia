It is a part of theHunter simulation series and serves as a reboot of the whole series.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>No plot whatsoever is present in the game. At the beginning of the game, the players create their own character and complete a tutorial. After that, the players are put into an immersive open world where they can either hunt any animal they find or activate missions, the completion of which grants the players some amount of the in-game currency.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s world is resembled by an immense island that features the surroundings of Washington, United States; Australia; France. The game can be played freely, yet only five species are present in its free-to-play version.</p>\n<p>While hunting, it is essential for the players to use cover to avoid getting detected by their prey. Each animal has its own specific reaction to the changes in the game&#39;s world. Some animals do not sense smells as well as the others, so the players can get to the prey much closer. It is also essential to take the sound you make into account, as it may scare the animal you hunt away.</p>\n<p>For hunting several species, it is required to use a specific weapon. The players are free to use bows on any animal they can find in the world, while the game&#39;s firearms&#39; calibers have to be carefully picked out by the players, based on the animal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/496a873faaee08ff2a9f2b0d40e9ee05.jpg", "website": "http://www.thehunter.com/", "rating": 2.51, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 48, "owned": 1630, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 79, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 171, "ratings_count": 115, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 115, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avalanche Studios", "Expansive Worlds"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Expansive Worlds", "Avalanche Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
