It will be easy to connect the dots at start, but the difficulty will increase while you progress. It will not be so easy when you have to connect 4 color lines or illuminate split pipes. Connection creates a nexus between brain and soul: some levels will make you think, others will just beautify the moment.<br/><br/>The nexus between brain and soul isn\u2019t always easy to achieve, but that fusion exists on here due a calm soundtrack, color lines that glow and a new way of IQ measuring.
