{"id": 979676, "slug": "brutal-ball", "name": "Brutal Ball", "name_original": "Brutal Ball", "description": "Brutal Ball is a multi-perspective option shooter that is also a deadly sport set on far away bizarre alien arena locations. Each team has a two meter tall spiked ball that can be controlled and thrown. In addition to its deadly spikes, the ball\u2019s electric field will damage players if any contact is made. The ball will decrease in size depending on how many kills a team has. As the spiked ball shrinks, the ball becomes a more effective weapon and easier to shoot goals with. Oh yeah, players can also shoot their opponents if that is what they are into. Four different gauntlet weapons that cater to different play styles are available to choose from. Points are given for goals, and from traditional kills.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayer motivation: As a hybrid, Brutal Ball has the strengths of both multi-view shooter and regular team-sports games. The game offers players a competitive environment with team building elements in addition to kill or be killed action. Outsmarting the opponent is key. To thrive, teammates must coordinate plans and execute them to be successful. Anyone who has ever been on a team knows: the bonding that comes from working as a team makes victory even sweeter. Plus, who doesn\u2019t like killing opponents in different and exciting ways?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T10:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/7808ffa71acff2406e7f434e4d01daef.jpg", "website": "https://www.lucidmatrixstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 545, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucid Matrix Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lucid Matrix Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
