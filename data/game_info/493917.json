Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li><li>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li><li>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</li><li>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</li><li>If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace &amp; 10), you got a blackjack.</li><li>Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.</li><li>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</li><li>Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.</li><li>Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.</li><li>Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.</li><li>You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.</li><li>You cannot play on two aces after they are split.</li><li>You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadrupling you bet.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T02:47:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/9126107e8339baa7bdfac0ada717033f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joonas10"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
