With a complex system of variables, the player gains various bonuses when leveling up, such as Health and Attack Damage, and even a Chest Drop, is left on the map and an indicator shows where he is, the Drop Chest, gives you random benefits based on player level, the order of probability is: Health &gt; XP &gt; Weapon Upgrade &gt; Fireballs. There are 6 different Weapons in the game, what changes between them is the type of attack, this impacts the player's gameplay.</p>\n\n\n<p>My name is Jefesson Nunes, I'm 25 years old and I live in the countryside of Brazil, I currently work as Graphic Designer, I started in the game world more than 7 years ago of learning and projects, I want to work only in game development and new technologies because it's that I love to do, this game jam for me is a great opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Email:<strong> flyberflb@gmail.com</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: <strong>@flyberFS</strong></p>\n<p>Discord: <strong>Flyber#6101</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:44:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/059c84d1ab0ce7a7de0a1241655d12f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flyber"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
