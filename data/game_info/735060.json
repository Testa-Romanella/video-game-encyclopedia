A tiny-adventure game about catching birds, while avoiding dogs.</p>\n<p>Game created for Mini Jam 99. The theme is birds, which I think this game clearly fulfils. Also, the limitation was that something must always move, and what better to be always moving than the birds you need to catch?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This was the second mini jam game I made and had a really good time making it. Who can have a bad time when making a game with cute dogs and birds :)?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f7/5f774b497a65d1829113fa370b34fff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naix99"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
