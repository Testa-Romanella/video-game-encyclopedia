The goal is to survive the 3 levels while managing your onboard store of energy. Collecting too much energy or taking a hit without any energy remaining will cause you to take damage.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>This game is the first entry in my portfolio. It isn't exactly a brain-wrinkler in terms of gameplay or design but I promised myself I would create and 'release' a game by the end of 2020. I'm quite pleased with the outcome even if it is a bit rough around the edges, at some point you have to call it a day. I solidified a lot of my understanding of Unity and specifically Unity 2D over the course of development which I'm happy about.</p>\n<p>The source for the unity project can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/KobaltBox/FLO</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I used some audio from\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/Leszek_Szary/sounds/146726/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/LloydEvans09/sounds/187024/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/MakoFox/sounds/126422/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/broumbroum/sounds/50565/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/broumbroum/sounds/50561/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/3075d8865a91f74561d3fa5ede2988b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JackMcComiskey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
