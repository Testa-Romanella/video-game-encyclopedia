If you can and ofc want to be sure to donate using this link:\u00a0https://teamseas.org. Every dollar donated is a pound of plastic in the ocean\u00a0less.</p>\n<p>How it works:</p>\n<p>There are 5 maps and they're all getting flooded by trash. But not ordinary trash, sentient trash. You are put in a map of your choice for 2 minutes and have to clear out as much trash as you can. You can adjust how much trash gets spawned every second to remove even more trash or less if you're still working on your trash killing skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c31d90cd79015a2797a60215d6cf5c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["slobbymonk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
