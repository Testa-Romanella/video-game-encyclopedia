Each number can only appear once per line and per 4x4 square, but also binary restrictions apply inside of each square, limiting the numbers that can be placed on any one tile.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLearn Hexle's rules with the game's introduction and then go forth completing generated puzzles in various difficulties. Come back every day to solve the daily challenges or to tackle the weekly 16x16 megaboards! As you complete puzzle grids you will unlock new color palettes to change the mood of the game! (light and dark palettes are available from the start)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can stop playing at any time and continue your puzzle later. There is one save slot per difficulty which you may continue or reset at any time. The game plays entirely with the mouse.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T07:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be2eac1574a55a635a7a0e2bb0426fc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE D\u00e9licieux"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE D\u00e9licieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
