{"id": 927120, "slug": "the-moments-between-time-complete", "name": "The Moments Between Time - Complete", "name_original": "The Moments Between Time - Complete", "description": "<p>In \"The Moments Between Time\", players begin as nothing more than shapeless energy stuck between moments in time. Through this game, they have the ability to give themselves a name, a form, and find out information from the deity of time, Kairos. There are two primary endings to this game, however, the game has the chance to infinitely loop.\u00a0My goal for this project is to give players a feeling of powerlessness in the face of insurmountable odds; this is the reason the player is already in such a desolate place from the beginning. I want players to question who they are and how they got into this situation to begin with. Primarily, player choices consist of dropdowns, several links, and input prompts to progress the story. Overall, I acknowledge that the story is on the more abstract side of things, but that was my intention. I don't want players to be so confused that they aren't even sure what's happening, but I do want them to ask questions and be curious to the true nature of what's occurring.</p>\n<p>To date, this is my most stylized and complex piece I've made with Twine. That was my goal from the start, but I hadn't even planned on making it as complex as it ended up being. While it isn't stylized in the sense of image use (because it wouldn't fit thematically), I feel that the style I did put into this game really enhance it - instead of it being a simple reading game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T11:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad0f1641df716f06a61137d2deb3851b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AquaPhoenix101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
