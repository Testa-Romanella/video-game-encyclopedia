After they've been damaged, they will grab the dice and throw it back at you!<br/><br/><strong>How does your game fit the theme?</strong><br/>The player must throw their dice at the enemy Orcs in order to damage them. Upon hit, the damage dealt will be equal to one of the faces of the dice. You must dodge the enemies' attacks, and hide behind cover when possible. Sometimes when there is no cover, you must take the risk of getting hit 6 and dying immediately.<br/></p><p><em>Me and\u00a0mademir\u00a0created this game for the GMTK 2022 game jam.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e926966b5cf5be19d8209ebf5036164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["haftaici"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
