I used Pygame to make it. it's for the Pygame Community Easter Jam April 2023.\u00a0\u00a0The theme is ParticleOverdose, so as the name of the game. lol.</p>\n<p>for that I made sure to make as many particles as I can. oops. it dropped the fps. matters not. particles are cool.</p>\n<p>The Art, Code, and the Ideas are 100% mine. (except for some parts of the Assets, which I got inspired by other peoples work).</p>\n<p>I went short on time, so the game is <strong>MUTE</strong>, there are no sounds at all, there is no menu, and there is not story involved.</p>\n<p>Your goal in this game is to find as many diamonds as you can, as fast as you can.\u00a0you can arm yourself up with 6 different swords with different abilities, you need some of them to gather certain diamonds.</p>\n<ol><li>use UP,DOWN,RIGHT and LEFT to move.</li><li>use A,S,D to move the camera.</li><li>use 1,2,3,4,5,6 to switch between swords.</li><li>use F for normal attacks and V for special attacks.</li><li>use Q,W,E,R,T,G as shortcuts for special attacks.</li></ol>\n<p>Spoiler:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>as disappointing as it sounds, there are no enemies in this game yet. because it's for a jam and the deadline is just 3 hours later. And I'm extremely tired.</p>\n<p>So what do you need the swords for?\u00a0okay, for stuff like <strong>teleportation, flying, dashing, and lava immunity</strong> and stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>if you liked this project please consider starring it in my github page. it means a lot to me.</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/mmdmoa/ParticleOverdose</p>\n<p>Also, you can run this game from source for a better experience. the requirements are only pygame-ce.</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to FinFET channel and Notenlish who helped me with this project!</strong>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:36:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2eec6d595a6e1d91378862504604ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Moein"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
