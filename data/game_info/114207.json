The phone is ringing. The\r\ndetective is lying on the couch.</p>\r\nDev notes\r\n<p>Made with Bitsy, the tiny, adorable game construction kit. I made some modifications to support scripting exits to new rooms inside dialogue, fetching game data from a URL, and setting the page title from the game data.</p>\n<p>The Bitsy editor only permits 2-frame animations, but the engine supports multi-frame animations if you hand-edit the game data.
