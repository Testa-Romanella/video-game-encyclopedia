The theme was spellcasting, but because I thought that there are so many games about magicians out there I tried to go with a different concept. Thats why I have decided to create a game where you aren't the magican, but the magic he casts. Arriving upon the world you realize, that you - as the spell - life and thats why you try to survive by not hitting any of the Zombies.</p>\n<p>Its a basic endless survival gamewhere you will rack up a Highscore by surviving. Use WASD for movement and Space to shoot little flames clearing the way for you.</p><p>If you start up the game set the graphic settings to ultra. On any lower graphsetting some of the animations don't work properly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:05:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bd1353b2a559616a405e8e6e4e0a09d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Huliandos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
