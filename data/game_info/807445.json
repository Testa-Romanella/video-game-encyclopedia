That said, everyone, the qualifications of his limbs and skills will depend on how far he is from the center of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>This is my old project, I did it back when there was Steam Greenlight, but it was a very long time ago. Play to your health :) now this project is on HDD, I'm not doing it.</strong></p><p><strong>Multiplayer in the game is only through the local network.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T10:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f554ea1b350a04cfab903cdf23338662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Total Craft Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
