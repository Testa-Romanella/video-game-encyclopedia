Both games were developed by an internal team at Sega named Sega interActive and designed by Michael Lantham, a developer with Sega of America from their early days.</p>\n<p>Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side includes the nine playable fighters and non-playable boss from the first game, and adds 13 new playable characters (nine of which are hidden) and a new boss. Also, new moves called \"Cinekills\" were added, which are essentially fatalities scenes rendered in full motion video.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810bd3671e2791c6b0bdfedd47ca484f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SEGA CD"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
