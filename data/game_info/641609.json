Poor Snow White has always lived her life at the bottom of the ladder, when one day, she's accused by her own gang leader and surrogate mother, Queen for secretly plotting against her. With her life turned upside down, what comes next for Snow White?</p>\n\n<p>This is a narrative game I made for my university assignment, although this version uploaded is an ''uncut'' version that has a few extra segments I couldn't include in my assignment due to time restraints, as well as ''uncensored'' images that have blood included. I'm publishing this for the sake of gaining any feedback I can get to improve, thank you for playing and have fun! ^^<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T09:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10e843373934b44c924c79ca789759f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fallgazer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
