{"id": 748671, "slug": "num-one-revised-edition", "name": "Num One: Revised Edition", "name_original": "Num One: Revised Edition", "description": "<strong>Num One: Revised Edition</strong> is a mathematical twist on a match-3 puzzle game. Combine and level up numbers, allowing them to swap further distances. 1s make 3s, 3s, make 9s, 9s make 27s, etc. Can you make a 2187?<h3>Game Modes</h3>Play and unlock a total of 6 game modes varying in the number of types of 1 blocks and the grid size. Types of 1 blocks are represented by color and shape (customizable). Three or more blocks of the same value (and type for 1 blocks) combine to form a new block with a value equal to the sum of the numbers in the combination. Move blocks by swapping two adjacent blocks. Swapping is only allowed if it creates a combination.<h3>Innovative Match-3 Gameplay</h3>Every time blocks are combined to create a larger number, they level up. The higher the level, the large the range that block is allowed to swap with another block to form combinations. This powerful ability gives you more tools in controlling and organizing your board.<h3>Collect Numbers</h3>Receive achievements for each new number you create. Collecting numbers allows you to unlock new game modes. Try to get the highest number possible in each game mode for highscore and highest block records.<h3>Customize</h3>Play in light or dark mode. Fully customize how your game board looks by modifying the colors and shapes of all block types. Colors can be chosen for each 1 block type and each level tier. Additional options are available to invert color during dark mode and hide the level value of the block.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T04:07:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/0851158967f3e350768637adeba66c29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C5H5 Games Lab"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["C5H5 Games Lab"], "esrb_rating": null}
