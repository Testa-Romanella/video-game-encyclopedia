Existence is getting faster and faster. Legend has it, Frogs used to live for years, but nowadays they only live for a few minutes. Soon, they may stop living altogether.</p>\n<p>There is hope, however. An elderly frog\u00a0(over five minutes old!) has recently brought news of a prophecy to the village: Time can be saved if 12 sacrifices are made at the 12 nearby Shrines of Anura!</p>\n<p>Can the villagers activate all the shrines before Time is up for everyone\u00a0forever?</p>\n<p><em>Croak</em> is a frantic\u00a0platformer where you play a series of rapidly-aging frogs. There are 12 <strong>shrines</strong> hidden on the map. To win, activate each shrine by bringing a frog/tadpole near it and <strong>sacrificing</strong>\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Each phase of a frog's life gives them different skills:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tadpoles</strong> can swim well, and use their stamina to <strong>Dash</strong>. However, they aren't very effective on land.</li><li><strong>Adult Frogs\u00a0</strong>lose their ability to swim underwater, but can walk on land and use their stamina to\u00a0<strong>Jump </strong>from place to place. (This includes being able to jump out of the water from the surface)</li><li><strong>Elder Frogs\u00a0</strong>aren't able to jump anymore (bad knees), and are quite slow moving. However, their minutes of experience have given them the <strong>Wisdom\u00a0</strong>to sense nearby hidden objects (using stamina, naturally).\u00a0</li><li><strong>All frogs can Self-Destruct at any time, in case they get stuck.</strong>\u00a0</li></ul>\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyEffectArrow KeysMovementX (hold)Use AbilityZ (hold)Sacrifice (if near a shrine), Self-Destruct (if not near a shrine)\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, Art,\u00a0 Music,\u00a0Everything: <strong>Violet Moore</strong></p>\n<p>Playtesters:\u00a0<strong>Kayleigh van Overen, Christopher M.
