Players need only \"mouse click\" to control the knight to jump to avoid the monster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou must be flexible enough to survive the monster and get as much food as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBeing hit by a monster will lower your hit point, and when hit zero the knight will die. There is no way to attack in this game. All you have to do is avoid it. The movement patterns of monsters need to be explored by the player himself. It's easier to find patterns. I hope the players can get more food for the people.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaybe you'll find some unexpected surprises in the game.
