All Dragons!", "description": "<strong>Once more into the breach!</strong><br/><br/>The business of making holiday plays is good business, and once again, the Elsinore Empire has tasked Kit Marlowe and their theater crew with making a smash hit! \"Twelfth Night\" is to be the crown jewel of the Winter's Tale Network's tenth-anniversary, with the fate of capitalism in the balance!<br/><br/>Will there even be a holiday without holiday movies? Not if you can help it! Assemble your team of actors and put on the play to be broadcast into the homes of millions! Be careful, though, because depending on how you train your actors, how their personal lives are going, and so forth, personal grudges may spill out into the production! We wouldn't want that, now would we?<br/><br/>Set phasers to stun and get ready to engage (wrong genre but go with it I guess) in this visual novel/light management simulator! Take on the role of writer, director, and friend as you play over five acts, both with two phases: Real Time, and Twelfth Night.<br/><br/>Will you ruin friendships? Start relationships? Wreck lives? Go completely ham with your godlike power over this production? Only time will tell!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a7af4a54cefe6f92a24287bf00d8cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
