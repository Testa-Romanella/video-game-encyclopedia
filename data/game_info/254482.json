(I hope not, because that's going to be patched soon)</p>\n<p>Do you want to play the \"Darksouls of the Jump n Runs\" ?</p>\n\n<p>Well, then listen up:</p>\n<p>Velocity is a physics based 3D jump n run game. Your velocity decides on how hard you will push back the objects you jump on (or hit if you jump against them). Only you are effected by gravity.</p>\n<p>\"Velocity\" aims at the small group of people who love playing 3D jump n runs, who love finding their own way to solve a level and get the best time on it.</p>\n<p>___________________</p>\n\n<p>So far there is only a tutorial followed up by 2 short levels.</p>\n<p>There are still some known bugs that will be fixed in the future.</p>\n<p>I'd love to get some feedback from both, casual and hardcore players.</p>\n<p>If you want to post videos about you playing the game, feel free to do so, but please send me a link of the video ! I'd love to see other people testing my game !</p>\n<p>You can also send me ideas or other kinds of feedback at velocity.game@outlook.de</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game (besides one I made for \u00a0a game jam) and I'm still learning new stuff every day.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e20691dbea086abc8852c3e35e58a0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sei556"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
