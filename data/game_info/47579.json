Ayo\u2019s struggle is shared by many girls in Sub-Saharan Africa who live in communities that have no access to clean water. The daily burden of fetching water is carried by women and children, who go on journeys to distant sources and return home shouldering a 40-pound container filled with water for their families.<br/><br/>With no time left for education, many women are denied the opportunity to develop themselves and their communities. An estimated 200 million hours are spent each day on water-fetching around the world [1], leaving both girls and women with little opportunity to break this cycle. <br/><br/>[1] UNICEF, http://www.unicef.org/media/media_92690.html <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65ad4187e90e11482ff0bac3ccbd94d7.jpg", "website": "https://www.ayothegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 321, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Inkline", "Inkline s.a.r.l", "Inkline s.a.r.l."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inkline", "Inkline s.a.r.l"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
