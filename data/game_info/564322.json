The first mod being the aesthetics of the game visually, as well astroid walls that are destructible. I also included bosses within levels 2 and 3 which have more health as well as their lasers doing more damage. Lastly, I've changed the music for every level. Hope everyone enjoys! Any feed back is incredibly helpful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:36:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b056718e2a974c5e56b6b979c59a1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Lucasohlmann"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
