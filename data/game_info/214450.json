This contamination is depriving earth from any kind of natural light, i.e. Sunlight.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0To solve this, one guy named George has came up with a torch, which emits UV rays in such a way that it simulates sunlight. The torch can also change the intensity of the light it emits. The torch can bloom plants like natural sunlight would, and also melt things on high intensities. <br/></p><p>CONTROLS-</p><p>WASD to move.
