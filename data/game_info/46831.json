{"id": 46831, "slug": "tale-of-toast", "name": "Tale of Toast", "name_original": "Tale of Toast", "description": "Tale of Toast is an open world MMORPG with core gameplay inspired by what made old school MMORPGs endlessly fun and engaging. With its easy to pick up play style, open world player versus player with high stakes for those daring to partake, and its focus on simple yet tactical combat, social aspects, trade skills, procedurally generated dungeons and quality over quantity quests, it is sure to have something for everyone.<br/><br/><strong>Engaging combat with risks and rewards</strong><br/>Experience battles throughout the world against enemies, world bosses, players, or by taking part of large scale guild wars. Will you be a villain killing innocent players for their inventory, or will you lead a posse to protect the innocent and take out those villains?<br/>With regard to world PvP, the various zones have different restrictions, though you can always take part in a duel or fight without risk inside the PvP Arenas.<br/><br/><strong>Classes</strong><br/>Tired of being told what you can and cannot do with your character? In ToT, you do not choose a class for your character; you yourself decide what type of character you create. Perhaps you will make a pure melee warrior or a hybrid mage and ranger?<br/><br/><strong>Trade Skills</strong><br/>You may take up a wide range of trade skills such as Mining, Woodcutting, Botany, Fishing, Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Leatherworking, Paring, Cooking, and Alchemy. The number of trade skills you take on is completely up to you. Will you become a generalist or focus on becoming the #1 chef on our high score list?<br/><br/><strong>Dungeons</strong><br/>With both world dungeons that all players on the realm can enter, as well as instanced group dungeons, everyone can do their preferred dungeon. Dungeons scale to the level of the players inside, and dungeons are procedurally generated to ensure that each time you enter the same dungeon you will get a unique experience.<br/><br/><strong>Quests</strong><br/>With high focus on quality before quantity, you will not find hundreds of quests that tells you to kill certain monsters, but instead you will find epic quest chains that unlock special features and opens locations for your character.<br/><br/><strong>World</strong><br/>In the land of Astaria, you will find an open world taking place in a single zone with towns, capitals, forests, fields, summer areas, winter areas, desert areas, volcanoes, mines, and dungeons for you to explore in a dynamic day &amp; night system and weather system.<br/><br/>Free-to-Play, but not Pay-to-win<br/>The game is Free-to-Play, and offers micro transactions for things such as cosmetic items, pets, guild features, character renames and realm transfers. We have made a strong point to not have Pay-to-Win features in our game, so you will not be able to pay to gain an advantage over anyone else in combat.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-22T10:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38df05759a554400cebf8650474e281e.jpg", "website": "https://taleoftoast.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 182, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Toasty Leaf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Toasty Leaf"], "esrb_rating": null}
