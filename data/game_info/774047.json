He was not very rich, and making his subjects pay taxes made him very unhappy and sad, but the state coffers were getting emptier and emptier. One day he heard about a treasure that was hidden in a mysterious swamp. The adventure was about to begin.</p>\n<p>This game is not really a game, but just a try, in order to permit me to learn how to use Unity. It's a platformer where you have to get all the coin to open the door to the next level.</p>\n<p>There are certainly a lot of little bugs, fixes and updates will be made in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And what next\u00a0?</strong></p>\n<p>In the future, I imagine more levels, and the story would be about a hero who wakes up with amnesia, he has forgotten everything. The goal of the game would be to help him recover bits of his memory and his life by talking to various npc he meets in the levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T19:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b132ed0424173c6f2aa774b8338c9d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlexisAmand"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
