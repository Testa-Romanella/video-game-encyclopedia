Unlike two previous expansions (Winter Assault and Dark Crusade), it was not developed by Relic Entertainment, but by Iron Lore Entertainment. <br />\nBeing the expansion of Dawn of War, the gameplay in Soulstorm is similar to the original game. It is a real-time strategy combat-focused game based on the tabletop wargame Warhammer 40,000. The players have to build bases, train units, obtain upgrades, gather recourses and fight with enemies, strategically using unique traits of different units.  <br />\nThe main difference in Soulstorm is the addition of two new factions: all-female imperial division Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar \u2013 a faction of Eldar space pirates with apparent sadistic tendencies. It also features new aerial type of units for every fraction, the new campaign and few new mechanics and gameplay tweaks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/61d/61dd8a874f97c7fa1f4c90d9c6318414.jpg", "website": "http://www.dawnofwar.com", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1850, "beaten": 208, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 77, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 278, "suggestions_count": 676, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 278, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Relic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
