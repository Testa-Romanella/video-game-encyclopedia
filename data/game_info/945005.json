{"id": 945005, "slug": "rocket-control", "name": "Rocket Control", "name_original": "Rocket Control", "description": "This game is an extremely simple 2D action game where you launch, control, and land rockets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe only user input is to iginite each booster to the left or right using the A and D keys on the keyboard. When you want to move the rocket to the right, you activate only the left booster and stop the right booster. The opposite is also true.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe rules are simple: ascend to an altitude of 1000 meters, start the descent, and then land back at the original launchpad. That's all there is to it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are three rounds in total, and they get progressively more difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are two conditions for a successful landing: speed and angle. If you try to land at a speed that is too high, the landing will fail (and the rocket will explode). Also, if the angle of the rocket is outside a certain range, the landing will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the rounds progress, the range of allowable speed and angle becomes narrower. In addition, from the second round onward, wind will blow and push the rocket around.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n**How to Use**<br/>\r\nLeft Booster : 'A' Key<br/>\r\nRight Booster : 'D' Key<br/>\r\nThat's it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T04:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ece2a804246a3468254e5d69e298a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Northbrain"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Northbrain"], "esrb_rating": null}
