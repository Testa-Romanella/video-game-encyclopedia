They had been travelling for days upon days, and Dame Holly had chosen to set up camp in the shadow of Mount Zilok - a most majestic peak. Unbeknownst to either of them, the foothills had recently been commandeered by a marauding band of Orks, led by the dishonourable and wholly unkind General Urgal. He and his lieutenants had watched Dame Holly and Sawyer approach the hills, and had recognized them as the legendary Ork slayers. Under the cover of night, he and 11 of his best warriors struck, catching Sawyer unawares and dragging him to the plateau of the mountain. There, to keep him from escaping, the General instructed his 11 best mages to trap Sawyer in stone. With great difficulty, they succeeded.\r\n</p>\n<p>Dame Holly woke shortly thereafter, disturbed by the lack of Sawyer's heavy breathing, which she had become accustomed to. She spied the telltale torchlight from the plateau, and dashed off to save her friend.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You are Brave Dame Holly. Having made your way to the plateau of Mount Zilock, you must keep the Orks from Sawyer for as long as possible. If 3 Orks make it to Sawyer, it's game over.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are equipped with your trusty longsword, which a the bane of Orks.\r\n</p>\n<p>The longer you survive, the more Orks are awakened and will attack.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys: Move<br/>Spacebar: Swing Longsword</p>\r\nThanks and Legal\r\n<p>Thanks to Elitistinen for the battle music (http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/556215)<br/>Thanks to Coyo91 for the game over music (http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/552434)<br/>Thanks to SpikeVallentine for the main menu music\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to Mike Koenig for the dog bite and decapitation sound effect (http://soundbible.com/1529-Dog-Bite.html,\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1008-Decapitation.html)<br/>Thanks to SoundJay.com for the whip sound effect (http://www.soundjay.com/misc-sounds-4.html)\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to irenafreitas for the title image (http://www.flickr.com/photos/38399441@N02/9463702436)<br/>Thanks to surt for the hero and demon sprites (http://opengameart.org/content/blowhard-2-blow-harder)<br/>Thanks to Gwes for the dog statue sprite (http://opengameart.org/content/misc-dark-fantasy-scenery-sprites)\r\n</p>\n<p>Game built using libgdx (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)<br/>Time functions provided by Joda Time (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/)\r\n</p>\n<p>Code is available at Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f6/1f6afe5570daa7df19ad6e3fce625c8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["murrple_1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
