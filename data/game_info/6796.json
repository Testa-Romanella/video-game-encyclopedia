You can however activate touch-to-turn and manual acceleration in the settings menu, but we strongly recommend giving the default controls a try. In any case you can adjust the sensitivity of your turning in the control settings.<br/><br/><br/>Tricks are hard to pull off!<br/>You should only launch tricks on the bigger jumps to make sure you can land them without crashing. Flips and especially spins are much safer on the medium and small jumps.<br/><br/>The 3 Categories provide progressive difficulty.<br/>In 125cc, jumps and tricks are easier to land, whereas in 450cc you will have to complete your spins/flips/tricks before landing if you don&amp;#39;t want to crash.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8faf21741e477beca164182161e81ba0.jpeg", "website": "http://www.fmx-riders.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Quadsphere"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["NICOLAS SEVEZ"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
