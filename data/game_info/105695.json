However, there is one final challenge you must overcome before you can become a Samurai.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGenpuku is a short VR experience set in Feudal Japan, developed in Unity 5 for Oculus Rift\r\n\t. Experience the rich colours of Autumn in a traditional Japanese shrine from the eyes of a child.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game is a student project, and our brief was to create a historical experience with interactable characters and dialogue. This could either be based on a real historical event, an event in the future, or a re-imagining of a historical event.
