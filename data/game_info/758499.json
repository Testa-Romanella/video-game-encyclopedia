What should've been a ten minute, boring, meeting with a foreign dignitary becomes a heated, passionate, affair that throws into question the very foundations of their allegiance to their nation.<br/><br/>Can Gauss navigate these rough waters while still staving off war? Can they keep their secrets safe -- and in their pants?<br/><br/>Set in the Untamed World, a post-post-apocalypse (sic) dark fantasy world created by the Forgotten Workshop. Read as intrigue splashes up against romance, duty stains honor, and lords and lieges swap places for a set of hot, sizzling, moments.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Kinetic Visual Novel<br/></li><li> Erotic Scenes with tantalizing text<br/></li><li> 25 Event CGs<br/></li><li> Unlockable CG Gallery<br/></li><li> Rewindable Log<br/></li><li> 1200~ lines of Sexy, Politically Intriguing, Romance</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T03:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/601337d6ff302f57e62d4d0e22b24625.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["herSecretSmile"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forgotten Workshop"], "esrb_rating": null}
