The game plays as an arcade racer, where it does not attempt to perfectly simulate actual motocross. The main portion of the game is featured around the World Tour Championship mode, which places the player in races of varying degrees of difficulty, and requires the player to beat their opponents in sequence. An arcade mode allows players to choose any event for single races. Once the player has completed some championships, the game opens up new modes for the player, including traffic (where the player races through incoming traffic), dragster (drag racing), and freestyle (freestyle motocross).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e91/e915747b637f17270f18962c26a71533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Delphine Software International"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Infogrames"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
