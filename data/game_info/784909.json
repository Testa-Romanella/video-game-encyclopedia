Rescue butterflies and survive in a dangerous castle. <br/></p>\n<p>You entered a grand castle with decorated walls and stained glass windows. Nature has started to reclaim parts of it and the floors are covered with big, vicious ants. Luckily they do not seem to mind the much smaller caterpillars crawling beneath their feet. You feel it is your duty to rescue your brothers and sisters.<br/></p>\n<p>Yullin is a game that I have wanted to make for quite some time. I created most of the sprites years ago with little knowledge of how to combine them into a fully playable game. Even though the game is short and improvements can be made to most of the sprites, I think it is good enough to share.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you find it good and thanks for reading!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:28:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/8436e2fad7dc9508df31a248e9acf035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Crumblebit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
