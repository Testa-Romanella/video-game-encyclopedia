Coins saved from a level count toward your coin total, which will allow the tower to be built higher and allow the player to reach more levels. Each level in the game contains a number of coins that can be collected and permanently saved by reaching the end. Levels may contain special birds that drop coins if they can be killed, but the birds may leave if certain conditions aren&#39;t met. Yellow birds will fly away after a certain amount of time has passed, pink birds will flap away if you kill any other enemies, and green birds will flutter away if you use a double jump. Levels also may contain entrances to secret levels</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T20:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a26af91f08d33a5c4af818f0de3e2b.jpg", "website": "http://www.mattmakesgames.com/games/MoneySeize/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Thorson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
