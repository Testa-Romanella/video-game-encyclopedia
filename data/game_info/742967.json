Progress through 9 unique levels, and replay any you've already beaten to try to beat your best score and achieve those S ranks!<br/></p>\n<p>As you play through the game and unlock new milestones, you get the option to choose from additional square designs to play as - see if you can unlock all of them!</p>\n\n<p>Controls: WASD or\u00a0Arrow Keys to move the Squares. (hint: pressing directions simultaneously could result in a diagonal move which can be utilised to beat the minimum possible score - definitely a feature and not a bug)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Shortcuts:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>-Backspace to undo move</p>\n<p>-Delete to restart level</p>\n<p>-Escape to return to menu</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was\u00a0 made for my A-Level Computer Science coursework using the Godot Engine. Game doesn't look great visually as it was just me working on it, and I am no artist - but it functions which was the most important aspect for me.</p>\n<p>I had a great time making this, and it was the main factor in deciding to pursue VGD at University.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f581e5a011083a3da2c8ce25fcda28dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Malachi Kiloh-Munns"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
