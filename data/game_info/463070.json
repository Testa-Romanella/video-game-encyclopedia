You play a minigame to \"roll the dice\" and use that number to go around a \"board\", when you land on specific spaces you are asked to answer a question or play a minigame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You're trying to get the most points by going all the way around the board or whatever, also it's 4 player only: there's no leeway, you MUST have exactly four.</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0set in the Infirmary Museum in\u00a0Worcester, the board is a replica of the actual museum and the questions are supposed to be answered using the information in the museum.</p>\n\n<p>Thematically it's about running a hospital and trying to make money: the name is a pun. It's less funny if I explain it but it's like surgery and money, that's the joke.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ignotas Burba</p>\n<p>Hassan Ishfaq</p>\n<p>Jack Woodward</p>\n<p>Luke\u00a0Mitchell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:36:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b19bb95be90049f2692baaab9c50a97e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Stout"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
