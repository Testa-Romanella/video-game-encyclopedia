However it should work without any major issues, although a random crash might occur.\u00a0<br/>You can quit by pressing Ctrl + Q during game - or old skool by pressing the window close button.</p>\r\nSystem requirements\r\n<p>GoKartGo! Nitro!\u00a0 should run properly even on older machines (5+ years old).<br/>This version does use a bit more video memory due to the some higher resolution menu and world textures.\u00a0We recommend running the game in 1280x720.</p>\n<p>Please note performance will degrade more when running the game in a higher resolution and with more of the experimental advanced features turned on as these are not hardware accelerated.\u00a0</p>\r\nImportant\r\n<p>GoKartGo!\u00a0Nitro! is 16:9 and\u00a0runs in a window.\u00a0 Only experimental fullscreen functionality (Alt+Enter) is supported. Best fullscreen result is your native resolution.</p>\n<p>GoKartGo!\u00a0Nitro!\u00a0 was made with Adobe Director, which has become obsolete over the past few years.\u00a0 We are trying to keep this game (and our other games) from being forgotten or lost.\u00a0 The game is fully functional, even on Windows 10.</p>\n<p>Please mail for help or any issues to support(at)xformgames.com.</p>\r\nXformGames Archives\r\n<p>GoKartGo!
