The ones I worry about the most.</p>\n<p>Horror games are the most famous treatments against anxiety. They <strong>desensitize</strong> you from stressful situations. But these games are not suitable for the most sensible people.</p>\n<p>That's why this had to be\u00a0a \"casual\" game, for nongamers. Having some <em><strong>spiders</strong></em>\u00a0is the main obstacle. Nothing too crazy. Suitable for very sensible minds. And some other Level design strategies that I have been developing, that\u00a0force the player to<strong> get out of their comfort zone</strong>.\u00a0(And that's the thing I consider to be the innovation in this game)</p>\n<p>And as a second objective, I've been using some techniques that could relieve stress.\u00a0 Showing <strong>satisfactory</strong> sounds, satisfactory actions,\u00a0beautiful landscapes, and making the gameplay nice to look at and play.</p>\n<p><strong>Games are not the definitive treatment,\u00a0</strong>but it will certainly help if there isn't another option, as for the 1/3 of people who for any reason aren't able to take professional help.</p>\n\n<p><em>All of these conclusions\u00a0that I made while the game was in development are not permanent conclusions. I know this is a very complex theme.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Post your clips of drone movement as a hummingbird\u00a0in the comments(That would be nice)</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time, and for reading my thoughts.
