Protect your operating system from a stupid user who clicks every shady ad that appears on his screen.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>This is a tower defense game where RAM is your currency and health at the same time. As enemies get through your defense lines, you will have less resources to put turrets and will have to be more strategic. But don\u2019t worry, you can reposition your turrets as much as you like, at any time! There are no costs attached to refunding a unit. Just make sure you don\u2019t run out of RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Background Music by: One Man Symphony</p>\n<p>Turrets were made based on: rubberduck</p>\n<p>Robots were made based on: Sprite packs 3 &amp; 4 (GrafxKid)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183869bee5368ca170089cd39b669db8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiny Gecko Studios", "mrbelf", "m98lima", "Guilleam", "Ivandev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
