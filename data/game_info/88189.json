Players must help a young Ape score high on one of the most popular game shows in Primate Ville, Buzzer Buzz. In this game green means stop and red means go. When the buzzer changes to red you must quickly tap it to score. If you hit the wrong buzzer more than 3 times its game over! Although it sounds easy this game can be challenging. As the buzzer begins to change colors, the pace will quicken at random intervals. It\u2019s a very fun and fast-paced game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b428d58a277a9a82e81a55abde6ad4_OWes1Vg.jpg", "website": "http://www.myarcadegames.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ocal Sonmez"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ocal Sonmez"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
