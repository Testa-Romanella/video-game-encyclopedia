No two plays are ever the same and it is completely free-to-play. The game centers on a tiny knight stuck in a small dungeon and you have to reach the final boss to escape.<br/><br/>Collect upgrades to survive as you make your way to the final level, there are no saves and if your character dies you will have to restart. Collect keys, unlock chests, find gems, kill enemies and shop to upgrade or smash power-up blocks to find loot and your way to the end.<br/><br/>Be warned, some loot has negative effects and collecting loot blindly can have consequences that will make the game much harder.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> if you have issues, find a bug or have something to say then please post in the Community Hub for assistance   <br/><br/><ul><li>Completely free-to-play <br/></li><li>Random dungeons &amp; loot - no game is ever the same<br/></li><li>2D Top-down retro pixel graphics<br/></li><li>30+ Power-ups to collect with stacking<br/></li><li>Permadeath - no character upgrades or saves<br/></li><li>Hardcore mode if you prefer a real challenge<br/></li><li>Low system requirements - should run on most PCs</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T06:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b09392d512843a1211f302aaab07928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unklnik"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["unklnik"], "esrb_rating": null}
