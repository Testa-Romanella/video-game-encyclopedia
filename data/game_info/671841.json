{"id": 671841, "slug": "hands-and-hooks-to-deck", "name": "Hands and Hooks To Deck", "name_original": "Hands and Hooks To Deck", "description": "<p>In <em>Hands &amp; Hooks to Deck</em>, the player takes on the role of a pirate captain and his crew, to battle other pirates at sea. Your crew is represented as cards in your hand, which you play to generate tokens to battle the other pirate ship. This game was\u00a0developed in Godot engine. All code, art, music-ish by me\u00a0- a one-man-dev-team - in 10 days as part of #GBJAM9 - my first game jam. It is not in a complete status and is more of a working prototype of the core battle card game mechanics. I wish I had more time ... especially to write better instructions .... so apologies in advance for the\u00a0sprawling mess that lies ahead ...</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>Z is Gameboy \"B\"</li><li>X is Gameboy \"A\"</li><li>Space is Gameboy \"Select\"</li><li>Enter is Gameboy \"Start\"</li><li>The cursor keys are Gameboy D-pad.</li></ul>\n<p>Beating a ship takes two phases; 1) Sea Battle, and 2) Crew-to-Crew fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In phase 1 - Sea Battle -\u00a0You have to sail the boat into a position to fire your cannons and/or\u00a0grapple the other ship.\u00a0 Grappling - or being grappled - begins the 2nd phase.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cannons damage received in phase 1\u00a0has an effect in phase 2, as any remaining damage that you haven't repaired with Carpenter cards, will remove 1 slot in your hand of 5 cards.\u00a0 For example,\u00a01 cannon damage leaves you with only 4 cards per attack round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To hit the other player with cannons or grapples you must play the same - or more - sail tokens compared to the enemy. If you play fewer \"sail\" tokens than the opponent, then none of your cannons or grapples will hit, but theirs will. Equal sail tokens result in both sides scoring hits - it's like ships are broadside-to-broadside. A higher sail token score means you've positioned yourself broadside-to-stern/bow, and your cannons/grapples hit, and theirs will\u00a0miss.</p>\n<p>Sea Battle is complete as soon as one - or both - sides land a grapple. If you land a grapple and your enemy does not, you have an advantage in phase 2, as the enemy must play first, and you may see their attack score before you play a card. The enemy will have the same advantage should they land a grapple on you, and you have not. In the case of a draw, both sides must play blind, without knowing the other attack score until cards are revealed.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 - Crew battle -\u00a0you must play 1 - and only -\u00a0card in your hand.\u00a0 If you played a card with a higher attack score than the enemy, you give that amount of damage to your enemy. Likewise, if the enemy plays a higher attack score than you, you take that amount of damage. A draw results in both sides taking damage. If you reduce the enemy hearts to 0 you win - if your hearts are reduced to 0 you lose.<br/></p>\n<p>Lastly, pirates only work for rum. You must keep making rum with the cook to keep your stock up. A pirate without rum is not a happy pirate but can be forced to work, doing so will cost you the same cost but in hearts/morale. You must balance rum level and heart/morale level to win. If you run out of rum and lose all morale, the crew mutinies, and the game is over.</p>\n<p>Due to the limited screen resolution, minimal text is used, so you must study the following\u00a0legend for the icons used in the game.</p>\n\n<p>The screen layout is the same for Sea\u00a0Battle and Crew Battle, only the tokens required and displayed at the top of your stats bar - and enemies stat box - are different. The following is an illustrated guide to the different icons placements and their meanings.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Crew and their roles:</p>\n<ul><li>CAPTAIN: Makes 1\u00a0GRAPPLE token, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>GUNNER:\u00a0Makes 2 CANNONS tokens, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>POWDER_MONKEY:\u00a0Makes 1 CANNON token, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>SAILING_MASTER: Makes 3 SAIL tokens, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>BOATSWAIN: Makes 2 SAIL tokens, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>PIRATE: Makes\u00a01 SAILS token, can attack in Crew battle.</li><li>CARPENTER: Can repair 1 cannon damage in Sea Battle.
