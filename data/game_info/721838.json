A single year after the Imperium of Nations declared war on the Middle Eastern Coalition, beginning the\u00a0War on Terror. The Imperial Alliance forces are already losing the war\u00a0as they struggle to defend and hold the majority of\u00a0land they've captured from MEC forces the previous year, being overrun and driven backwards particularly by\u00a0the Kartani Crusaders, a warband of religious zealots and natives of Kartenstan, eager to spill a lot of blood to\u00a0defend the Middle East from Western invaders\u00a0in the name of Allah - be it the enemy's blood, or even their own through sacrilege.<br/><br/>The Imperial Alliance\u00a0has summoned a call to arms for mercenary freelancers to join the war effort. A band of 10 mercs have volunteered on a covert operation to infiltrate Kartenstan and assassinate the Crusader's three leaders: brothers, Xoleran, Legget, and Kane Fargo.<br/><br/>On route to the objective, your chopper is shot down by artillery and crashes. You are the sole survivor and you are without radio support. You are forced to complete the mission alone. How long can you\u00a0survive in the harsh Kaleshi Desert? How far can you reach your objective?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/296a259aca14aa59ebd3022c509e6ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["N\u00e9otl Empire"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
