Bombs appear on the playing field in a random place, you can launch rockets that destroy them when they explode, for each destroyed bomb you get 2 points. The difficulty is that launching one rocket costs one point, and they fly to the target for a certain time, so you need to calculate the trajectory to the bombs and try not to miss. If you run out of points, you will immediately lose. You also need to make sure that the number of bombs on the field does not exceed 20, otherwise you will also lose. Use your accuracy.
