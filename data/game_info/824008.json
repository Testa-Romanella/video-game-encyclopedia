It features collectables, box and button mechanics, not to dissimilar to the one in the Portal series and moving platforms. The level design was slightly more focused on exploration than it's predecessor. The game went through many iterations during it's 7 month development span until I lost motivation to work on it any further and was shelved in January 2018.</p>\n<p>This demo features 2 completed levels from a December 2017 iteration of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T11:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970dfe5702a0de87afd1efbca1b174f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bp269"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
