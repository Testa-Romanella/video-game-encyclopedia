There are different difficulty levels and play modes, and a high-score list.<br/><br/>Swedish speakers can choose to play with Swedish terms, though the interface remains in English.<br/><br/>The Livecode stack has to stay in the folder with the other files. (If I had time to redo the game today, I'd internalize all resources to make it just one file.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d22/d22cab55aa15ea88dcc170701b8938a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AndyB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
