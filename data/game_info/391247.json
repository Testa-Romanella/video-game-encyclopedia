Depraz)", "description": "5 Levels\r\nA small platformer game created with Python3 and Tkinter\r\n<p><em>(Please note this was created as a student project, and contains bugs)</em></p>\r\nHow to play :\r\n<ul><li><strong>You will need to have Python3 installed in order to run the game !</strong></li><li>If you have Python3, just execute either <em>_5levels.py</em> for the base game or <em>Launcher.py</em> to access more options.</li><li><strong>The goal is to pass 5 levels without dying, with randomly chosen rooms for each level. Each run will be different depending on which rooms you will get. </strong>Be aware, that this game can be very frustrating.</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Use arrows to play, Left and Right to move, Up to jump and Down to go through platforms</li><li>Esc to pause and unpause game</li><li>Enter to start</li></ul>\r\nAdditionnal content:\r\n<ul><li><em>5 Levels</em> uses a simple <strong>content pack system</strong>, that you can access through the launcher. With the launcher, you can launch the game with different resources by entering the name of a pack located in the <em>\"</em><em>resources\"</em> folder. <strong>Anyone can create their own pack to use with game</strong>.</li><li>A content pack contains sprites, but also levels. You can create your own levels by following templates in the default or debug content pack.</li><li>The <em>\"versions\"</em> folder contains older, dev versions of the game. I don't recommend trying them unless you want to see the dev process, as they are highly unstable and mostly unplayable.</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for playing this game, and good luck !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/8791714160aa8666ed6e8e57208be743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T.
