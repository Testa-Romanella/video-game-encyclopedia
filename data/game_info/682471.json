It's also 150 games by a bunch of the biggest video games developers in the world - developers who are often seen as part of the media bubble that is the video game industry.\n\nThe Microsoft team (pictured above), which is responsible for the games that have been listed, have given the Family and Digital Entertainment Trust of U.K. a heads-up on the situation, sources say, but some of these games are already out in the market.\n\nThat's the nice thing about it - Sony's response to this crisis is a bit more muted than Microsoft's about the impending crisis. No one who wants to see these games come out of the shadows will be silenced by the fact that they are on the way out. And while there's something to be said for taking the spotlight off of the games industry who are hurting / hurting, perhaps the best thing we can do is encourage them to run with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/142c03855da09927e36714766530364d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
