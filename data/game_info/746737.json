Then our teacher said that we are clones. We were all confused at first. Then she said that a clone is a person who doesn't get to work or do anything dangerous. Because when the person that they are a clone of gets badly injured that clones body parts get used to help the injured person. And the clone is left to die. I didn't really understand anything at that time but I understand now. I was walking with my friends in the clones park. Then we found a doctor, he had a syringe gun in his hand and he tried to shoot me, but thankfully he missed and now</p>\r\n\u00a0I need you to get me as fast as possible to the CBunker. \u00a0It should take me 200 seconds to reach it.\r\n<p> In there all of the chased clones hide, and if they are seen out of that bunker they are instantly killed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d774e23cba925d9c1ac7aff300b6fdc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ZiyadCodes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
