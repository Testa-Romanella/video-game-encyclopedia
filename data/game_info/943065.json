The number on the left is the position of the leftmost digit, in pi, while the right side is the position of the rightmost digit, in pi. This application covers 1000 digits, memorize them all haha</p>\n<p>Nice BGM in the background, never added a mute button forgot (more like it's 12am)</p>\n<p>Why you should memorize using 7 syllables:</p>\n<p>7 syllables with a silent note at the end means 8 notes in a measure, making it musical, making it easier to memorize (at least for me).</p>\n<p>How to memorize using 7 syllable sequence:</p>\n<p>Each digit is spoken out loud: Three Point One Four One Five Nine, then, Two Six Five Three Five Eight Nine, etc. For seven and zero, you see that there are two syllables. There are indeed scenarios where a seven-syllable sequence cannot be made. In such a\u00a0scenario, you can fill in the silent syllable and directly connect the two seven-syllable phrasings, or if possible, shorten Zero to \"Oh\" and get your seven-syllable phrasing. Personally, I alternate on whether or not to shorten zero, for example, if it comes in the beginning I leave it as is, if it comes in the end I turn it into an \"Oh\". Feel free to comment on any suggestions for shortening seven to one syllable!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:37:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/1619cd3936baa37e0e63728cbdea90c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MyCatsAreFat"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
