However, I was unable to complete these because of time restrictions. I'll make an update to add that cut content, if the game is received well. <br/></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Hard mode is how I intended this game to be played, the timers and minigames are supposed to make you feel panicked or <em>\"on the edge\"</em> some might say ;). However,  I added an easy mode so all can enjoy it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DIRECTIONS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Most directions will be in the game. <br/><br/>Press TAB to open up the room switch menu.</p><p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>All parts of the game were created by me with the exception of the song.</p>\n<p>Song was made by Juhani Junkala:</p>\n<p>This asset was obtained on opengameart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8d8333c48c4431e8c903846e44e1d33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
