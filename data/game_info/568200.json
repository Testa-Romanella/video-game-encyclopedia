{"id": 568200, "slug": "my-neon-nightmare", "name": "MY NEON NIGHTMARE", "name_original": "MY NEON NIGHTMARE", "description": "<p>This game was made for WoWieJam3. The theme for the jam was \"Failure is Progress.\" I implemented that theme with, upon the character's death a part of her soul would spawn at the location of death. By collecting the \"soul shards\" the player would use the soul shards as currency to purchase upgrades at in \"Limbo.\" \u00a0To give the game the \"reoccurring nightmare\" idea I created a system that would take the character to a random level at the end of each level. Repeating a level is part of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>A, S - Move left and right</p>\n<p>SPACE - jump, if you hold jump when hitting the ground, you will bounce higher than your original jump height and you can use this mechanic to wall jump.</p>\n<p>LEFT-MOUSE CLICK - aim and shoot enemies.</p>\n<p>Tools I used to make this game\u00a0- Construct3, Aseprite, and Rytmik\u00a0 Ultimate.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>*At this time the upgrade system is not fully implemented due to a bug I was unable to fix before the end of the jam timeframe. Also, all story elements and the tutorial level have been disabled due to time constraints. \"Bits\" were supposed to be scattered around the levels and would also drop from enemies. Bits were also meant to be a currency that increase the amount of time the character could die before going to \"Limbo.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>**There are currently many bugs that I plan to fix once the voting period is over. Players have been asked to not update the game during the voting period. Please take this into consideration when rating the game.</p>\n<p>***I over-scoped hard on this game jam, not on purpose, but at the same time, I went into the jam knowing that I would only have about 18-20 hrs of available time to work on the jam because of prior family engagements. While I probably should not have entered the jam, I'm glad I did, because I learned a lot about adding story elements to the game which is something I haven't done until this time.</p>\n<p>All art assets and sound-fx are by myself. Music is by TeknoAXE, you can find his many royalty-free tracks on\u00a0YouTube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:51:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/960fe19f5c3fd663d23b236757561ccd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
