It was awful in every way, but I loved it like a son.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, Super Freaks 1 wound up undergoing so many updates and overhauls that it's become a\u00a0Ship of Theseus, and arguably isn't even the same game anymore. It's now a surprisingly modern platformer, with actual level design, weirdly advanced graphical features (including the ability to play the game at any framerate), and most importantly, a robust co-op feature. Two players can tackle this silly game together, armed with drop-in/drop-out multiplayer, a NSMB style bubble, and an optional Knuckles Chaotix style rubber band tether.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Planned are several challenge modes which you will unlock as you progress through the game. You'll unlock a free play mode, a randomized endless mode, a boss rush mode, and a few speedrun modes.</p>\n<p>This is Demo 1, which has 6 levels out of a planned 30. Future demos will have more levels and maybe even a few challenge modes!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T14:56:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/74374b0b3ebbecc1a526249c8f80bec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperFreaksDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
