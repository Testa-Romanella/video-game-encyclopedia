On the one hand, my lack of experience and scope management became quiet obvious and on the other hand I needed to waste a lot of time fighting Unity, especially in the end when I was trying to build the project.<br/></p>\n<p>On to the game itself: Try to escape the robots by making your way through 5 dungeon levels. The robots are relentless and will respawn over and again. Blast your way through them and reach the exit!<br/></p>\n<p>All things considered, participating in the game jam was great fun. See you next time!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Background music: https://opengameart.org/content/cave-theme by Brandon75689<br/></p>\n<p>Robot death sound: https://opengameart.org/content/robot-1 by DaGameKnower<br/></p>\n<p>Art and Code by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50b30ecdfde2fd86b4068e7bd77a523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SeriousMaxGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
