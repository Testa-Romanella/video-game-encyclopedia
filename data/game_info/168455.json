EZFPS is designed to make a simple FPS Deathmatch style game, with Ai bots, zombies, player classes, weapon loadouts, and attachments. As the player gets kills, they receive XP points and rank up, allowing them to unlock new weapons. The kit comes fully setup with 4 maps, a zombie-only mode, 8 weapons, and 3 classes, but an infinite amount of maps, weapons, and classes can be added easily by following the included tutorials and documentation.</p><p>Features: </p><p>- Player Classes </p><p>- Weapon Skins and Cosmetics</p><p>- Synced Bot Ai </p><p>- Synced Zombie Ai </p><p>- Custom Loadouts </p><p>- Weapon Attachments </p><p>- Rank System </p><p>- Weapon Unlocks </p><p>- Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, Knifes, Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers </p><p>- Settings Menu </p><p>- More!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce6606ae543cef11eb751922b7e1d275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aidenstudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
