The  idea is to produce a small voxel-based game, and to create a new level  every day of October 2022. The concept is similar to A Road to Awe, on which I worked during the entirety of 2017.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself is less  abstract and aims at a bit more gameplay, with a third-person view and  light puzzle elements, but is still spontaneous and experimental, with  no other goal than to explore and illustrate a personal creative  process.</p>\n<p>The current game is extremely minimal. Besides new levels, new features will likely be added over the month, and possibly beyond. This includes updated gameplay, music, visuals, dialogues, and anything I may find interesting along the way.<br/></p>\n<p>Of course, the idea is also to share this process, and to let anyone literally play with it. I'll probably release all sources when the game will be complete.</p>\n<p>Lunaires is made with RPG in a Box.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Using the Itch app to get the daily\u00a0updates effortlessly is recommended.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81a8064376101a14faa1778294f7ae48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["lectronice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
