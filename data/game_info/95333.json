In the velas, the city's neglected shantytowns, riots turned violent as inhabitants fought for rights and citizenship. Back then, <strong>Gunkatana</strong> meant freedom.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThen the megacorporations co-opted the concept and now sell it for profit. It has become a way of steering unrest and opposition into the right channels. They're siphoning off the most violent and charismatic rebels.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNot all is lost, though. Among those training to fight, a feeling of dissent is growing stronger. But the corporation doesn't plan on releasing its grip on \r\n\t<strong>Gunkatana</strong> anytime soon\u2026\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f175318c1b24347ee857bf70f9465d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Torn Page", "gondorle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
