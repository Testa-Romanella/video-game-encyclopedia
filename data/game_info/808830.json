If you want to type like a 'pro' than this game is for you!<br/>In the GAME MODE simply hit the falling letters when they are below HORIZON LINE. There are also special items: Apple, Blackberry, Cake, Egg, Honey, Kiwi, Lemon, Marshmallow, Orange, Pineapple, Raspberry, Strawberry, Yogurt and Watermelon which you can hit earlier if holding SHIFT key. This will score all the other letters below if they are not missed. You can also catch a Bi\u010dCoin ;) and then 'cash in' on all the tiles on the screen if pressing Alt+B<br/><br/>In the TUTORIAL MODE you can learn how to place your fingers on keyboard and which fingers type specific letter. You can also practice at your own pace to memorize the keyboard layout. When you're ready, go and play the game and watch your progress.<br/><br/>The game has 5 levels and a tutorial. Its design embraces memory principles for fast learning.
