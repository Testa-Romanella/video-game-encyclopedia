{"id": 878038, "slug": "atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree", "name": "ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree", "name_original": "ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree", "description": "The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEstra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nViolence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by a variety of incredible artists, including: Julian Ratschiller, Australian artist Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments, and Andrew Prahlow, whose name can be attributed to the critically acclaimed hit Outer Wilds and epics like Star Wars and Blade Runner.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-28T19:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/764/764a67609bc1ed48a6a72990541a91b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wildboy Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Untold Tales"], "esrb_rating": null}
