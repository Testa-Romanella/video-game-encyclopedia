Or just try to loot the most whales. It's your choice.</p>\n<p>Made for 7DRLx17, this is a\u00a02d space ship roguelike that got out of hand, until the knife of reality dismembered the featuritis, and a lot more than that.\u00a0Oh, and there are space laser fights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How is this a roguelike? I'll admit I adhere to a looser interpretation, focusing on permadeath and highscores rather than tiles and ascii.</p>\n<p>Loosely inspired after a dwarf fortress binge and tarn adams interview. There is a low amount of persistence, but that does not significantly impact gameplay. Very much based on the original strange\u00a0adventures in infinite space. Art all original, but heavily referenced from starsector. Oh, and star trek's probably in there somewhere too.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/241d073cdf3928cd5f81bc9ef440bd60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aivct"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
