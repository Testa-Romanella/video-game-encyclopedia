This means <strong>the game is in active development and can contain bugs. Features are not yet complete and will change between versions.</strong> <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>At the moment this game is two-player only. You need two game controllers and one friend to play this!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tBlack Hole Master is a simple, fast and difficult arcade game for two players. In a galaxy far away, an alien civilisation has mastered the control of stars and black holes. You are a Black Hole Master, a player trained for participating in the popular black hole battles. \r\n\t<strong>This app is free on all platforms, it has no ads and no in-app purchases</strong>.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBlack Hole Master is a light-hearted remake of one of the first computer games,  Pong. In this remake, each player now controls a black hole! The objective: to use the gravitational force of the  black hole and a slingshot motion to fling approaching stars towards the other player.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is being developed by a group of scientists working in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. We want to make free and fun apps related to our work.  The LIGO project has built a completely new class of observatory that can detect gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time. They are produced by violent cosmic events, such as the collision of black holes.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong> Please send us your suggestions, comments and bug reports so that we can improve the game.
