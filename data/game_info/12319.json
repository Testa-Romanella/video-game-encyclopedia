{"id": 12319, "slug": "defcon", "name": "DEFCON", "name_original": "DEFCON", "description": "<p>DEFCON is a unique RTS from British Introversion Software, known for such experimental projects. The user interface is minimalistic and simple: it resembles a tactical card stylized as Cold War films such as Dr. Strangelove and WarGames.</p>\n<p>The game is divided into Defcon phases in which players need to place military forces on a real world map. There are aircraft carriers, submarines, air defense and other equipment capable of either launching a nuclear warhead or reflecting it. The winner in the match is the one who most effectively bombarded the enemy territory. Defcon is a game about pure gameplay, there is no history, as there is no story campaign.</p>\n<p>In addition to playing with AI, a player can compete with real people online in multiplayer matches. In total, such matches can accommodate up to 6 people and this significantly complicates the gameplay. Opponents should guess the location of the rival&#39;s troops and inflict the most accurate nuclear strike.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2006-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-18T08:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6a/d6a68393fa48d1f2f2ae8e3406fc5ff9.jpg", "website": "http://www.everybody-dies.com/", "rating": 3.05, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 104, "owned": 2119, "beaten": 63, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 89, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 173, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 174, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Introversion Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Introversion Software"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
