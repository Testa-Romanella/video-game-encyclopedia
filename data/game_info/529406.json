{"id": 529406, "slug": "the-cleric-has-fallen", "name": "The Cleric has Fallen", "name_original": "The Cleric has Fallen", "description": "<p>The Cleric has Fallen aims to be a D&amp;D inspired turn based strategy game. It features a combat system where each party member\u2019s abilities and choices can sway the tides of battle. By understanding and factoring enemy intentions into their strategy the player will be able to effectively conquer the small laid out fights that we have in store for them. One of the selling points for our game is the lack of healing as is inspired by games like Slay the Spire. This gives real weight to deciding to attack over block when choosing actions in combat. Between each fight the player has the chance to spend gold at a shop on consumables, weapons, and armor to gain an edge over the progressively stronger enemies. By the end of the game the players should be able to avenge their fallen cleric and defeat the Lich\u00a0boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/0438381fb2dd15cc5b34db4aedd61b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katherine Rude"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
