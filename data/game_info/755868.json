This is for\u00a0Gamegen's Lesson module based on\u00a0Gran Trak 10. I learned about Track Design and got to make my very own time trial coarse. I also learned about time setting and creating a checkpoint so that\u00a0players have to get to a certain distance before the lap line collision will work so they don't cheat the game. I also got some special pointers out side the module. You see I wanted to make this cool loopdeloop that would test your drifting skills. The problem is that someone could just skip the look and head all the way to the finish line or go in the wrong direction. One of my teachers showed me how to make a code for a bridge crossing. Now you have to make the loop in order to make one lap around to the finish line. Let me know how this looks and how great my track turned out to be. Have Fun!!!</p><p>Here is a blog post about the making of this game:</p><p>https://jacoblince8.wixsite.com/thejlzone/post/i-finish-my-racing-game-time-tria...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06ce0afa1f3c744b6b882569c5cd25df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The JL ZONE"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
