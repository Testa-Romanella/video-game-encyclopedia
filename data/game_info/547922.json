One for each faction with an extra campaign that utilizes and takes advantage of what the game can truely do.<br/><br/>SKIRMISH:<br/><br/>Make your own rules! Choose a map from the pool and battle it out however you wish -- choose your faction, decide the teams, pick your starting location. In skirmish, it's a fight to the death!<br/><br/>Want something more random? Go-to the 'Random Map' settings on the skirmish page and generate your own map to your specifications<br/><br/>EDITOR:<br/><br/>Feeling creative? Make whatever you want!</p>\n<p>Whether it be a skirmish map, a single-player campaign map, a co-op campaign map, a tower-defence map or something that completely breaks the rules, the power is in your hands. Paint grassy fields, raise cliffs, create scripts or triggers, whatever your imagination can reach -- and then share your creations across the Steam Workshop (\u00a0coming soon )<br/><br/>RULE EDITOR:<br/><br/>Sick of that tank shooting two rounds at a time? Want your infantry to fire nukes at your enemies? Reckon your advance defence tower should cost $1?<br/><br/>Well that's where the rule editor comes into it. You have the power to create your own unique faction -- decide what your structures look like, how much they cost, how much HP they have, what they do. Same goes for infantry and vehicles.<br/><br/>Design your own weapons to the absolute smallest detail. Design their warhead, their damage their effectiveness, etc... then attach that weapon to YOUR unit.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no limit when it comes to expressing your creativity with these two editors. Go nuts!<br/><br/>ENJOY!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/71194d985af9fe8c1d9aeb19c4d6397c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flyrswep"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
