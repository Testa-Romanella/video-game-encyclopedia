It is a short game and can be completed within 10 minutes. The game is made using Unity and please forgive me for the bugs since I'm a beginner.\u00a0 The game uses a black-and-white filter with some jazz music to achieve a 1940s era.\u00a0\u00a0The game has few levels for now, but more levels will be added later. Please do comment if you have any suggestions for further levels and refinement for the game.</p>\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Maybe you're the only one I need\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-&gt; Please follow <strong>! </strong>to reach the destination, especially at the tower level.</p>\n<p>-&gt; To pick flowers, go to areas with<strong> !</strong> A cutscene will be played, click E to confirm the flower.
