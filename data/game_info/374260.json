This game contains flashing lights.</p>\n<p>The humans have finally wiped each other out. You are a laundry robot who no longer has any purpose. You have grabbed a ship and want to\u00a0explore a little of the outside world before shutting down. Lets see where we end up!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>R: Reset to checkpoint</li><li>WASD / Arrow Keys: Move ship or spin\u00a0robot</li><li>E: Eject from / return to ship</li><li>Space: Use the robot's jetpack</li><li>Space + WASD / Arrow Keys:\u00a0Use the robot's jetpack</li><li>Escape: Quit game</li></ul>\n\n<p>The second level may not be a great tutorial from what I've seen so there are some hints in the game's gifs and controls that may help out. If enough people find it an issue then some more direct instructions could be put here. I do encourage experimenting with the controls though!</p>\n<p>If you're getting lag from the web version it might be worth downloading the windows version and choosing a low resolution.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db623468b53e5eb3e40ec06c3d0e6fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SnoopyG", "SetumupJoe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
