It's just a matter of finding the five digit code.</p>\n<p>There's also mums missing Xmas cards to find. Your friends think they are so funny hiding them. Also, while you are searching the house, it might be wise to avoid the ghost of Scrooge who is wandering around. Unless you can find a way to get rid of him?</p>\n<p>Manage all this, and somehow get your school homework done, before your parents return and you really will have a very, merry Xmas. Good Luck!</p>\n\n<p>Bah, Humbug! was written for the SyntaxBomb adventure game competition and is available for OSX and Windows. The game was created with GameMaker Studio 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/ccca7dd453a3f7dd548b09e4d32f9bb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Xerra"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
