It's a contest of skill, it's a contest of the ability to <br/>\r\ntarget and take out targets. It's Balloon Fiesta 3D time again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are armed with a simple dart gun in this fun contest. You will be <br/>\r\nsituated in several fiestas, stages where balloons rise from holes in the <br/>\r\nfloor. You'll have to be vigilant, read the hints, watch the signs if you <br/>\r\nwant to survive this contest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe simple rule here, blast away any balloons you see, make sure none of <br/>\r\nthem floats beyond your reach to the ceiling. Sounds easy right? Except in <br/>\r\nsome fiestas, there are holes all around you and you will have to swing <br/>\r\naround a lot to shoot balloons. In other fiestas, you have rotating floors <br/>\r\nand targeting is going to be very difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd in some fiestas, balloons are coming from holes located even further <br/>\r\naway from your position, targeting is going to be quite difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake this hint to survive in this title, try to shoot balloons as they <br/>\r\nemanate from their holes. Do not focus on just a hole and the balloons <br/>\r\nproceeding from it. If you do that, other holes will produce balloons that <br/>\r\nwill float beyond your reach before you are aware.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBalloon Fiesta 3D is another lightweight title running with minimum memory <br/>\r\nand hard disk requirements making it suitable for lightweight PCs. It is <br/>\r\nalso designed to be suitable for all ages.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fc/9fc2ed69021b7417a39516d3597d972f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tonye Amienyo"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tonye Amienyo"], "esrb_rating": null}
