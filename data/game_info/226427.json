Help this flying insect to carry the balloon circle along the barbed wire path and avoiding the spikes. The farther you get without popping the flappy balloon, the higher your score. Tap the screen to flap the wings in the right moment so the balloon won\u2019t touch the barbed wire, else it will explode in your face!<br/><br/>Balloon FRVR is a challenging and nerve-wracking simple arcade game where you take control of a flying insect (a bee or a fly\u2026 not really sure) carrying a floppy balloon looped around a long and endless barbed wire.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s wrapped around what could be an endless string of spiked line! Tap the screen to make the dumb bug to flap his wings.
