Your test? To master Counter Spell. Rack up points by dispatching elemental golems. Careful, though. Each golem has a different attack type and requires different timing to properly counter. When you successfully counter a golem's attack, you absorb their power and gain 1 charge of their attack type to send back at them (you can also use a charge to blink in a pinch!). Lastly, some golems will drop cores that you can run over to absorb which will completely fill up your energy bar. How many golems can you take out before you are overwhelmed?</p>\n<p>Uses Lootlocker for Leaderboards.
