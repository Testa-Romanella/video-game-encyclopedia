The initial idea was a cross between Bubble Bobble and Kaboom.</em></p>\n<p>Freaky Fish has the ability to blow giant bubbles and must save his friends from the fisherman who is fishing on the lake with sticks of dynamite. </p>\n<p>Use a joystick in port 2.</p>\n<p>Up/down/left/right to move Freaky Fish. Press and hold fire to blow a bubble. Keep holding the fire button to maintain the bubble and swim into the dynamite.\r\n</p>\n<p>Capture the dynamite with a bubble before it explodes and when released it will float back to the surface and explode. If the fisherman gets caught in the resulting explosion you will receive 10 points. </p>\n<p>Every 3 hits on the fisherman gives a bonus of 5 for each fish remaining, the lake gets a little smaller and the difficulty increases slightly. </p>\n<p>If you get caught in an explosion you lose a life; when you lose 3 lives or all of the other fish are gone the game is over. </p>\n<ul><li>Programming by Chris Page (chrx)</li><li>Graphics by Brent Page (Bop)</li><li>Sound by Chris Page and Brent Page</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T05:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b6f5729aca5e6cd1dbc281e698e1543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DESIGN/chaos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
