{"id": 486370, "slug": "blue-blob-saves-the-baby", "name": "Blue Blob Saves the Baby", "name_original": "Blue Blob Saves the Baby", "description": "<p>This game was created in 72 hours by a single developer for the 2020 Extra Credits Game Jam. Other than the original Edvard Grieg composition I recreated, playtesting, and having someone scream into a microphone, all programming, music, sound effects, and art were created during those 72 hours by one person. This is the first video game I have ever published, so be kind.<br/></p>\n<p>The theme this year was \"Take Care\", and it's clear to see by playing the game where that theme was utilized. The intro cinematic introduces a young blue blob who lives in a rain gutter with several other blobs who witness a baby accidentally fall out of a window. Our titular blue blob jumps into action and stands determined to return the baby to its mother by navigating a series of puzzles.</p>\n<p>This game is top-down in isometric perspective and works on a grid-based movement platform. Return the baby to the marked location to proceed. Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6b069051a84b6beaa1f2fd55846aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["himham"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
