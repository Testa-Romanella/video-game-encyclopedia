To do this, you need to click on each plane to select it and click at the destination you intend the plane to go! Each plane needs to get to the corresponding color island, so make sure your planes are going the right way! As long as at least half of the plane is touching the island, the landing will be counted as successful. any of the planes crash or don't reach their destination, the level will restart, so feel free to go about the puzzle one plane at a time instead of trying to adjust every plane every time! <br/></p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER : This game is HARD, but every level is indeed possible!</p>\n<p><em>Controls:</em><strong>Select Destination: </strong>Click on the center of a plane and then click again on the destination you wish to go to.</p>\n<p><strong>Start The Planes: </strong>Press the \"Fly!\" button that appears on the screen when all planes have a destination or alternatively press A.</p>\n<p><em>Credits:<br/></em><strong>FlamingSparrow : Programming and Art<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>tomatohorse : Music/SFX and Additional Programming</strong></p><p><em>Music may be a little quiet so turn up your volume if that's the case.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06a386220c1a31d601488b9e4dc50ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["FlamingSparrow", "tomatohorse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
