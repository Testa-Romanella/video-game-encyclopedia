Can only be played in combination with the card game!<br/><br/>Werw\u00f6lfe Vollmondnacht, MorgenGrauen and VampirD\u00e4mmerung are quick games for 3 to 10 players. Are you the helpful seer, the sneaky troublemaker, or actually one of the bloodthirsty werewolves? If you combine the games, more than 40 roles with different abilities provide constantly new and exciting situations: because, when the night is over and the day dawns, you need to decide which one of you is a werewolf.<br/><br/>Each round is different from the last. And, because Werw\u00f6lfe Vollmondnacht, MorgenGrauen and VampirD\u00e4mmerung are played so fast, another round quickly follows, then another, and another... until darkness falls.<br/><br/>The app acts as the game master, so each player can slip into a role and play.
