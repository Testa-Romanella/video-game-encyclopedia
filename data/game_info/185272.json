It's meant to be\u00a0 similar<br/>to old tactical shooters , where you could control a squad of<br/>friendly NPCs. Because it's a \"proof of concept\", I'm not sure<br/>if I'm going to continue it or not. If people miss those old<br/>tactical shooters where a single enemy can kill you and<br/>see the potential in this, than I'll rework the placeholder<br/>scripts and continue the development with a cleaner<br/>codebase.<br/><br/>Test level:<br/>You are Bravo 1 and your squad mate Bravo 2 is wounded,<br/>but stabilized. You need to survive until the evac arrives.<br/>(No evacuation yet.)<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>WASD - move<br/>E - peak<br/>R - reload<br/>TAB - change weapons<br/>SPACE - interact (drag wounded friendly,<br/>take magazine from compatible weapon)<br/>L/R ARROWS - turn<br/>UP ARROW - change fire modes<br/>ENTER - fire<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/403ccf7f2c9c1047750a8672737be4c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProgramerKelly"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
