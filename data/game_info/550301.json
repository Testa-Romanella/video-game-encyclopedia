We're using this build to gather general feedback.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>There's is currently no save functionality!</strong>\u00a0It is recommended that you block out around 1 hour to play the demo all the way through (maybe a bit longer if you're streaming/recording). Don't worry - in the full game, you'll be able to skip the first chapter if you don't want to replay it.</li><li><strong>This is still a pre-alpha build</strong> - there are bound to be some miscellaneous issues!</li><li>Speaking of which, some users have reported misc.\u00a0<strong>issues with the \"Journal\"</strong> functionality. Thankfully, that feature isn't required to complete the demo. I'm trying to reproduce this issue so please let me know if you encounter it (our Discord is the best place to do this).</li><li>You can hold Enter to skip past dialogue at a very fast rate, which is useful if you're playing through the demo a second time to find something specific. Be warned, though, the skipping functionality is has the potential to be a little buggy!\u00a0</li><li>I haven't tested the Mac version too thoroughly - let me know if you run into any issues!</li><li>A small number of users are unable to progress past the \"breathing exercise\" early on in the demo. I'm looking into this right now and will post an update when it has been resolved! A temporary workaround is: instead of clicking on the \"Read the Light\" chapter, scroll down and tap on \"Read the Light (no fx)\". This version of the Chapter 1 has no background shader effects, which I believe was causing the issue.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>CW: Mention of suicide.</strong></p>\r\nSocial Links\r\n<p>Follow us on social media to keep tabs on the game!</p>\n<ul><li>Twitter</li><li>Discord</li><li>Reddit</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b223ee2bb1a9306fd0c378aafa7b035c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Moon Moth Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
