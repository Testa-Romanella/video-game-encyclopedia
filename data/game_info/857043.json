To reach her, Avon must learn to read emotions other than his own human feelings.</p>\n<p>This story is inspired by a short tale that I have read in a book by Brian Froud. The tale of a misunderstanding between a human and a nymph because she can't express emotions well in human ways has always resonated with me.</p>\n<p>My impetus to make this game for the Adventure Game Challenge was to take the opportunity to get something done quickly and not get carried away by perfectionism.</p>\n<p>In order to create this game as quickly as possible, the game's backgrounds as well as the base images for the protagonist's closeup were AI-generated, but then edited by myself. This might be considered artistically questionable, so I want to be honest about this.</p>\n<p>Although\u00a0the game's\u00a0puzzle mechanic is always the same, each playthrough is a little bit\u00a0different, as all major elements revolving around the puzzle are randomized [MILD SPOILERS]:</p>\n<ul><li>NPCs' positions, poses,\u00a0tints,\u00a0emotions, and texts\u00a0are randomized.</li><li>The locations of puzzle-items are randomly scattered.</li><li>The correspondence between emotions and expressions gets shuffled, which also affects the puzzle-combination.<br/>\n</li><li>The nymphs' language is procedurally generated according to a pre-determined phonetic rule-set.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48ae1492052a566b53915460ede7fd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher A.
