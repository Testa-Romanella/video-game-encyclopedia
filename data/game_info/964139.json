The game features characters taken from the series as well as introduces a few new ones. Additionally, every Zoid features a special attack, called an EX Attack, that can be used once the Zoid&#39;s hit points drop below 1/3. Many of the EX attacks are special attacks featured in the anime, such as the Blade Liger&#39;s Hi-Blade attack, the Geno Saurer&#39;s Charged Particle Cannon, or the Liger Zero&#39;s Strike Laser Claw.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T20:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e92bd0d3baa49ec709604fa2deade52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Tomy"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Atari", "Tomy"], "esrb_rating": null}
