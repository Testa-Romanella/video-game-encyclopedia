{"id": 462002, "slug": "a-windless-night", "name": "A Windless Night", "name_original": "A Windless Night", "description": "<p>A Windless Night is a 2-player RPG about an encounter with an alien, played via voice notes.</p>\n<p>You can play either in one session or spread out across a few days.</p>\n<p>There are two PDFs - one for the human player and one for the alien. Decide before you play who wants to be what, and then\u00a0<em>only read the rules for your role</em>.</p>\n<p>It's my hope that making the game play through voice notes will help people recapture some of the intimacy of an in-person RPG session, even when social distancing. Listening to a voice note can also feel kinda spooky, which is why I\u00a0like this theme for this game. It's not exactly a horror game, but I'd like it to have a bit of tension and a bit of a thrill-of-the-unknown.</p>\n<p>Originally produced for the Neighborhood Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>It's a work in progress!\u00a0No nice graphics or layouts yet and I\u00a0might update some of the later game content based on further playtesting. It's currently playable start-to-finish. If you play it, I'd love to hear what you think! I think it's probably to push this concept a lot further than I\u00a0have here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236c3b74ca160b8126e7d0628b0d0de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KillerBlobProductions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
