One day, in the Spiracle of Thunder, King Temp received a vision\u2014 the greed and selfishness of man would lead to the world's destruction. After 20 years of indecisiveness, the king decided to release a special hot and dense fog surrounding the castle grounds that causes humans to fall unconscious. The critters are unaffected and indifferent to the fog, thus beginning the conflict between humans and critters.</p>\n<p>The human scientists gathered in Mars Town and decided that an army of protective suits was necessary. They initiated began Project Too Grand. The first working model, the MM-2000, was carefully tested on one individual, Niisen. Although the results were successful, the scientists felt the need to make a new model version that uses significantly less resources so that they can make a large group of armored soldiers. The next working model, the MC-21, was created. Though it had less resistance to heat and blunt force, it was still enough to protect the wearers from the fog effects. Testing did not seem necessary, so all 33 soldiers in the MC-21 suits were sent out to go see the king.</p>\n<p>One week later, they all returned, and, under the king's mind control, they tore up the scientists' laboratory, and exited back into the fog, back to the king. With Niisen the only human left able to go outside safely, he set out to make things right. The question is... what will he do? It's a lot of pressure, but hey, he's an awesome guy in a suit! You know how the story goes\u2014 a kid hero with cool abilities goes on an epic adventure and beats the bad guy and saves the day. At least, that's how it should go, right?<br/></p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p><strong>Trivia:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was originally called \"Christmas in July\" back in 2015 and looked a lot weirder. It would have been a story about putting family first no matter the circumstances, but that would have been hypocritical. Not much was done outside of programming the gameplay and writing the gist of the story, but it was a good start.</p>\n\n<p>Then I decided that everything about that was garbage, so after making Sinfin Runs and Ayuda Flies (and while remaking them a million times for some reason), I changed the name of the game to \"Crisis Legacy\" in late 2016 with a new simpler/easier art style for Niisen and the story became about wearing a cool suit to bring peace by activating towers around the planet. I don't hate the idea, and I made one full level out of it (with gimmicks I still haven't incorporated  in my current builds). I even wrote a 28-ish page story. But I wanted more.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, I reset one more time. A more serious-looking Niisen, more realistic yet tighter controls, and most of all\u2014 SKATING. The story became less about activating towers and more, well, turning that into a bad thing. Or a good thing! It certainly wouldn't bring about peace, but hey, you do you. The story has gone through a few revisions, but is mostly the same as in the previous reset. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>Hopefully that's the last reset.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Watch me sometimes develop the game live!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Join the Caffeinated Gardeners Discord server!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/5270a02c7c9c9696fd16d58a35017214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David20Covers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
