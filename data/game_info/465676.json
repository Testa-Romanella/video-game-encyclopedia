The theme for this JAM was \"Out of control\" and, while we were thinking about how to fit this theme within a game, the movie Gremlins came to our mind from nowhere. We decided that, instead of letting the \"player\" feel \"out of control\" from an awful movement scheme or something like that, let's use our adorable Lemgrins and their weird rules in order to create a chaotic experience. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/188b92d8e4dc229cccadcc8324223fe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carlos P.
