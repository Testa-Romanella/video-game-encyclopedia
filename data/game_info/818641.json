You can always move cards about after you have placed them.</p>\n<p>Requires a mouse to play.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Classic RPG combat with a twist: </strong>Link every side of the die to combat abilities- for both you and your enemy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>-Tactically random roguelike:</strong> Will you bet everything you have on a single side? Or spread out your abilities evenly to guarantee at least one of them goes off.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>-Villain roulette: </strong>The cast of every run is randomised. Your party leader may become Darkness\u2019 champion next time you play.</p>\n<p><strong>-The sound of die-lence: </strong>All in-game sound effects created using dice.
