(VR)", "description": "<p>This is a game I made for the MetaFest VR Jam #1 that was held in September, 2020.</p>\n<p>The theme for the jam is \"Escape\", and in my game you are in a giant hamster ball,\u00a0trying to escape the environmental dangers of each level and get to the exit as fast as you can (ala Marble Madness).\u00a0 You are timed and graded based on how many gems and stars you collect in each stage.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> Some gems have side effects, so pay attention to their colors. (Specifically, blue gems will speed you up -- other gems were planned but not finished.)</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some levels also have giant scary cats in hamster balls too -- if they notice you, they will come say \"hi\" to you, and probably kill you by accident.\u00a0 So... you might want to run from them.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>The controls are pretty simple, just pretend you're in a hamster ball and use your hands to spin it from the inside. \ud83d\udc39</p><p>If you fall to hard (or off the level) you'll die -- it's not the distance that kills you, but the vertical velocity.</p><p>There are 5 levels, each of which can be completed up to 3\u2b50.<br/>\u00a0- One \u2b50for collecting at least 1 gem.<br/>\u00a0- One \u2b50for collecting at least 1 star.<br/>\u00a0- One \u2b50 for collecting all gems\u00a0and all stars (completing a level to 100%)</p><p>Your best time will also be recorded and displayed -- (doesn't matter if you collected any gems or stars on that run, you can just speed through to the exit).<br/></p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Supported Platforms\u00a0</strong><br/>I tested on the Oculus Go, and Oculus Quest natively, and on the Quest over link cable.<br/><br/>I couldn't get it to work with Virtual Desktop / SteamVR\u00a0on the Quest. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f</p>\n<p>For the WMR/OpenVR versions I just targeted their official plug-ins, but I have no way of knowing if they work or not -- so please let me know below.<br/><br/>Additionally, I plan to target Google Cardboard + Gamepad\u00a0if I can... we'll see how it goes. (The official plug-in destroyed my project, so it might be a day or five.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f2a2e3cc2cc4a32a4787a31ccf6e7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BrainSlugs83"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
