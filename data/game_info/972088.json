This sparked the initial concept for R1sikoChess.<br/><br/>As a lover of <strong>chess</strong>, <strong>Monopoly</strong>, <strong>Risk</strong>, and <strong>strategic war games</strong>, I decided to blend all of these games and elements into a context of a final war. Two factions compete for a very specific cause.<br/><br/>The <strong>World Dominion Organization</strong> employs a new model to regulate the dynamics of the world and all its human beings, from every nation around the globe. Every five years, they organize a war that will serve to set new geopolitical parameters.<br/><br/>Those who are called to participate in this war with the role of the first general of their army are actually taking part in a very unique race, or even better, a test; the most important test of their life. The climb to the pyramid. The pyramid of the Eye of Providence by Charles Thomson.<br/><br/>The <strong>World Dominion Organization</strong> eagerly awaits the opportunity to judge you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:<br/><br/>1) The classic rules of the game of chess will be the starting point, from here on, it will be a new way of thinking about chess.<br/><br/>2) 28 monopoly style events divided into military, political, and economic categories.<br/><br/>3) An artificial intelligence system that enables the CPU to analyze, understand, and learn your gameplay style (be it political, military, economic, etc.) and will <br/>    use this knowledge to challenge you, take advantage of your shortcomings, and exploit your mistakes<br/><br/>4) Every unit on the battlefield uses complex visual and mental calculations to perform their best during battles, including retreat or extreme tactics.<br/><br/>5) Military units use 7 visual and auditory waves that operate dynamically depending on the scenario, the vehicles involved, the weather conditions, and many <br/>    other variables to understand the surrounding world and act accordingly<br/><br/>6) Simulated weather with winds, cloud cover intensity, and the intensity of possible rain (weak, medium, hard) that will affect the characteristics of units on the battlefield; especially aerial vehicles, whether they are jets, helicopters, drones, or airborne munitions.<br/><br/>7) Physics recreated to manage all vehicles, equipment, and ammunition. Debris from explosions will become like projectiles with their own mass and velocity, <br/>    causing real damage to vehicles and the environment. A less precise attack does not necessarily mean it won't produce immense damage; on the contrary, <br/>    one must pay close attention to the damage caused even by the shockwaves of explosions.<br/><br/>8) The United Nations will monitor the behavior of both factions and may impose sanctions, more or less severe, on nations that employ overly barbaric <br/>    methods towards civilians or the enemy. Such sanctions can have various consequences in the military, political, or strategic domains and will have a <br/>    specific duration based on the charges brought forth by the United Nations. It will be crucial to take these sanctions seriously. Being at odds with the United <br/>    Nations in R1sikoChess, as in the real world, means being at odds with global public opinion<br/><br/>9) Simulation of mines, drones, conventional, aerial, naval, nuclear, and biological weapons.<br/><br/>10) \"Accurate calculation of characteristics and damage to buildings, natural objects, the civilian population, and all military units in the game.<br/><br/>11) Calculation of domestic and international public opinion that will judge your actions (as the United Nations do).<br/><br/>12) Each square on the chessboard will have its own geographical situation and special terrains that will really influence the player's tactics.<br/>      You will be able to fight in open terrain, in rural areas, in small villages, and all the way to cities. Each scenario will influence your tactics and the units you <br/>      choose for battles if you want to avoid situations where your troops or vehicles are annihilated due to your poor strategic and tactical choices.\"<br/><br/>13) Dramatic simulation of Rescue helicopters that will go through hell to save or health their men.<br/><br/>14) Simulation of terrorist attacks with calculations on the actual number of victims based on the geographic, urban scenario, and the type of terrain affected <br/>      by such an attack.<br/><br/>15) All the sounds during the fights are sounds of actual combat. <br/><br/>16) Full 42 pages instruction manual included in the game.</strong><br/><br/>And much, much more", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T06:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6a0cf3a07e4d0b6fbd3c52222809a9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aldo Campodonico"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aldo Campodonico"], "esrb_rating": null}
