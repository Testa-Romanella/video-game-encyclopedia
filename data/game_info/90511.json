FARA is a text-based roguelike that runs in your browser and has over 50 classes, a never-ending supply of dungeons, and countless secrets. The goal of the game is to collect enough Key Fragments to complete the Astral Key. Fragments can be found in many places - the depths of dangerous dungeons, the bottoms of lakes, or even in the pockets of unwitting strangers.\u00a0 Most notable actions in the game add to a score, and when you die, your score is added to a persistent total that unlocks new options the next time you play. FARA is in the alpha stage, and is buggy as hell.

New and more powerful entities (both friend and foe) will appear depending on the number fragments the player has.<br/>- Added a capslock warning message. It can be disabled with /capslock.<br/>- In addition to points earned, key fragments collected and days survived are now tracked on the leaderboard.<br/>- Removed the defunct /autokeys command<br/>- Changed the Quick Action window shortcut from [ 0 ] to [ ` ]<br/>- Most game settings have been removed from /help in an effort to make that window a little less daunting. They can still be seen under /settings.<br/>- Normalized keybinding text throughout the game. Lowercase keys will always been represented as [ x ], and uppercase versions as [ shift + x ]<br/>- Hiding the Quick Action window will now prevent the related logic from running, potentially improving performance<br/>- Fixed a bug that allowed chests and the like to be opened from a distance<br/>- Fixed a display bug when attempting to use /carry without a target</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8fec8939f20a92d0eb5e18d9c526a82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BrianIsCreative"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
