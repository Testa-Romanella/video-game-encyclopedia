It's not a masterpiece, because I lack experience and skill of a professional game developer, but I'm proud of it and worked really hard on it.<br/>This game contains tons of secrets and hidden messages, which, when gathered, come to a conclusion, so if you like mysteries, codes and all this stuff, you'll have a lot of fun (hopefully :v)<br/>The music is not composed by me, because I'm not a composer, but I did my best not to use copyrighted stuff.<br/>Although, I might've used something I shouldn't have. If so, tell me, and I'll try to swap it with something else.<br/>I hope you have a good time playing my game. &gt;&gt;app4K&lt;&lt;<br/>~Kagedile</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc4e9c7014130ad3d1fd1431f825f56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Randoragon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
