Levels are short and sharp, a successful run through each should take less than 20 seconds if you hit your targets!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE;</strong> This is a bare bones prototype, no menus or options\u00a0just yet (If you're on a controller\u00a0Y is inverted because\u00a0I don't hate puppies) but assuming I don't get bored of it, future update will have the standard\u00a0save\\load and\u00a0level select options as well as controller options.
