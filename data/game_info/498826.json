The developer is so certain that you are not going to get pass the first hundred points that he even made it so that if you get to 200 points, you win! Think you can beat that?<br/><br/>It's hard, not impossible...<br/><br/>You can also find out more about this game and how it was made on \"Xander Develops\" YouTube channel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a14d6850d55a4b48f9770673285f7f64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["XanderDevelops"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
