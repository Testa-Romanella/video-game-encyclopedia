The basis is a well known\u00a0concept, where a player joins a game and this game is composed from a few rounds.\u00a0During each round, the players in this game will fight each other in a deathmatch until\u00a0only one is left and wins the round. After each round all player can change and select new\u00a0skills. The score gained from winning single\u00a0matches, performance in battle and other achievements (Not yet Implemented)\u00a0determines the winner in the very\u00a0end.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game takes place on a small island surrounded by water and doomed to be affected by the rising water level caused by global warming. Casting abilities of the \"fossil\" type makes the water level rise even faster, shrinking the arena. Expending too many fossil resources hurts the arena and turns it slowly into a wasteland.<br/>On the other hand, the player can choose to cast \"renewable\" abilities, those have a bigger cooldown but do not harm the environment and even slow down the unavoidable sinking. In future versions playing environment-friendly will award the player with extra points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce071772cced64904a382f155603de5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AntiDog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
