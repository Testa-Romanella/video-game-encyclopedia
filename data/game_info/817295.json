Because it was my first \u201creal\u201d game (if you could call it that), I have a huge soft spot for it! In 2016 I tore out a lot of the old code (drag and drop blocks) and overhauled some things here and there. It\u2019s definitely still a 2006 Game Maker 6 game, but nowadays it\u2019s decent enough to be uploaded here to itch.io. I'm pretty much done updating this version of the game, but if you notice something glaringly awful let me know and\u00a0I'll try to fix it as best as I can!</p><p>If you want to play the genuinely good full remake\u00a0of this game, check out the in-development Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition:\u00a0Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition by SuperFreaksDev (itch.io). It's 100x better and actually feels like a real platformer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3aae6805440c45af9404ca6430be60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperFreaksDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
