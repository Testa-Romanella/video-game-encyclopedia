{"id": 84119, "slug": "wheres-george-official-app", "name": "Where's George? Official App", "name_original": "Where's George? Official App", "description": "The long awaited Official Where's George? iOS App is here!<br/><br/>This new Where's George? App replaces the previous app you might already have.  The old app has been obsolete and broken for some time now.   It was created by a third-party developer who completely abandoned the project two years ago. I had to start from scratch and re-develop the entire app from the ground up.  Because of that, I'm sorry, but upgrades of the old app are not allowed.  Please contact me if you have any questions.<br/><br/>This new app provides many new features, like the ability to take a snap of a dollar bill, and the app will read the Serial Number via the \"OCR\" button when entering bills.  Just take a photo of the bill with your phone, crop the serial number, and that's it!   You can still enter the serial numbers with the spinner wheels or the keypad, whichever works for you.<br/><br/>This new app also allows you access the desktop version of the website with just one tap -- if you want to access YOUR BILLS, or your HIT ANALYSIS REPORT or any other feature not available in the app.<br/><br/>The Where's George? app allows you to easily:<br/>-- Enter Where's George? Bills you find in the wild (registration NOT required)<br/>-- Enter new bill you wish to track (registration required)<br/>-- View all the bills you entered recently<br/>-- View all your recent hits <br/>-- Access the Desktop site with just one tap<br/><br/>Other website features are easily accessible from the \"Launch Desktop Site\" interface button.<br/><br/>I am now developing this app without any other intermediate or third-party programmers, so if you have any problems with the app or questions, PLEASE contact me first (you can send feedback right in the app), before leaving a bad review.  I promise that if I can fix or change something for you to make the experience better, I will. And I'll post prompt updates to address any issues.
