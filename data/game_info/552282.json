You have studied one flower for all of your career; it only grows every 40 years and blossoms for 3 days. During those days it cannot come into contact with any water or else it will drown and die. This year it is finally blooming! Unfortunately during the three days it is blooming there is expected to be heavy rains. Your job is to block any water from coming into contact with the plant.<br/></p>\n<p>To do this use the A and D keys or the left and right arrow keys to direct the rain away from the plant. Once the timer in the top hand corner reaches 0 the rain has stopped for the day. Be warned the rain gets heavier by the day. Good Luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Blackthornprod Game Jam 3. It was made in 7 days all the art code and sound effects were made by me.\u00a0 Please feel free to give any feedback/suggestions. Thank you for visiting my game! :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f519b291552bfac5f9f0b6fdc4a374a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Liam_x220"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
