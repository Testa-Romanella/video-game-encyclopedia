It has been a long break.</p>\n<p>Improved Tic Tac Toe adds a little more complexity to tic tac toe. If you place a small circle, then the medium X or the large X can take your spot! Use your pieces wisely as you only have 2 of each.<br/><br/>This is a 2 player game with no AI (sorry) made in 7hrs for the GDL July 21 gamejam. <br/>Grab someone in your house and give it a go!</p>\n<p>Player 1 goes first and must first click a circle piece and then click a square on the board. Then it is player 2's turn.<br/><br/>Click play again to restart.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/2414f4162e9d933b13c7d39a05fbfbda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ViolentCrumble"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
