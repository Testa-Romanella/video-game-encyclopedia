I like to share things I make, just cause I'm proud of them and I want to get feedback, unfortunately every single time I do so it gets ignored. Usually I post something, nothing happens for like 30 minutes then a different person posts something completely different and they immediately get replies of \"Wow that's amazing.\" \u00a0Basically I am mad, and I want other people to suffer, so I decided that I would make a game where instead of getting ignored for things you made, it's based on the similar phenomena of getting ignored for things that other people made that you support, in my case bands, why? I don't know, even people that listen to some bands I like don't listen to all the bands I like. GG.\u00a0</p>\n<p>.The making of the game paragraph:.<br/></p>\n<p>Maybe I got too distracted with audacity to work on it, but good news for focus, my computer thinks it's always running cause I crashed it. That said, I got to pitch down flight of the bumblebee and it somewhat sounds good and barely audible. Does it have anything to do with the topic? Just a slight feeling of being annoying. Also I didn't realize there was that big of a difference between the audio in the background, and the audio of the cassettes. It's funny how surprisingly well everything fits the concept if I think about it. Also I kind of hate blender, like I still have no idea what the heck is going on because I can't just use my track pad or the same short cuts that you have memorized. Also converting the finished game to a webgl file and having to copy the host link into your pirated chrome only to find out that the text is slightly off is fan freaking tactic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff99c66d0c4d8b4ac75c9d1e43ff4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShyWolfGhost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
