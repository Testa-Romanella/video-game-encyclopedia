A swarm of alien spaceships are coming to get your Orbs (...) use your shield to bounce their bullets back at them to blow them up. It's pretty fun, pretty challenging, I'm not sure what it's like past the first four levels, 'cause I can't get further myself. </p>COUPLA NOTES: <br/><ul><li>I made this forever ago. It is at least eight years old. I've never posted it online.</li><li>Hold Shift to move slower for Precision Deflection (TM)</li><li>I <em>have</em> made some tweaks to scoring and difficulty curve. Also added sounds.</li><li>I know that putting the \"Winners don't do Drugs\" screen at the start of a game is passe now but Gamehippo was still a thing when I made this game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de44277ede1c9854af242aa07f2520e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["metalsnail"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
