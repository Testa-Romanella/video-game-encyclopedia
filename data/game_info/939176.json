Complete quests, find items, choose allies, and battle your way to the throne. In Battle for Wesnoth, there was a day/night cycle, in a strategy game there is a Summer/Winter cycle, and the bitter cold of Winter is always around the corner ready to lay waste to your plans.</p>\n<p>Almost all images are reused from Battle for Wesnoth.
