The player controls a digitally fossilised goblin wandering through a virtual iteration of Charlois, the Rotterdam neighbourhood where the artist has lived for seven years.</p>\n<p>This is a Charlois reassembled from publicly available datasets and populated by glitching and twitching pieces of detritus.\u00a0Like the residents of the real Charlois, they are worried about gentrification, surveillance, and how to assemble a linguistic subject position in the wasteland of neoliberalism.</p><p>It's not really intended to be played to exhaustion and has no real narrative arc, so if you've wandered around for about half an hour and chatted to a few people then you've sort of \"seen\" it.</p>\n\n<p>This project\u00a0was kindly supported by a research and development grant from <strong>CBK Rotterdam</strong></p>\n<p>Early writing for some characters\u00a0was done during the <strong>R\u00e9sidence Internationale de Fontevraud hosted by NEF Animation</strong> in l\u2019Abbaye Royale de Fontevraud, September 2021.\r\n</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>Being more a directory of text works than a game, this work is unfinished and will likely always remain so. New characters may be added, dialogues revised, the map expanded, etc.</p>\n<p>However, the game <em>is</em> currently in Early Access and has some known technical issues:</p>\n<p>-Intuitively you'd think clicking the phone or wallet icons a second time would put these things away again. That doesn't happen, and it's surprisingly difficult to make it do so. Sorry. I'm working on it.</p>\n<p>-Generally using your phone and wallet at the same time produces some strange behaviour and should be avoided.</p>\n<p>-Picking certain dialogue options causes the game to shut down. This is intentional.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0002d492cf7b200414bce74eae84004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["daniel_tuomey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
