Each activity is going to raise one of yours status and lower the other two. Yet, everyday you will have different events, possibly affecting your status in a good or in a bad way.\u00a0 Your luck is determined by your stats: Emotions affect Work, Work affect Joy and Joy affect Emotions, so try to no lose control of any stat.
