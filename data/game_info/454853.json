I set out to create a reactive character animation system utilising Unreal Engine's animation blueprinting system, primarily working with state machines to achieve contextual animation based on environmental stimuli. The main context of the system was a self-built weather system that I created featuring 4 distinct weather states. Each weather state features its own set of locomotion animations. A total of 92 animations are featured in the system, 23 per weather state. All animations used were both captured and processed by myself.</p>\n<p>Transition animations are used between every possible state order (Dry to Cold, Cold to Wet etc.) in order to provide smooth transitions between the weather states. A total of 12 possible transition orders exist, with different animations for transitions when standing and when crouching, giving total of 24 possible transition animations in the system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:18:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5e/e5ec0a99c1f9a4d1b74f6d1bc7828195.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CBFeatherstone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
