Balfe, saithecomposer)", "description": "<p>Fig (short for Figaro) is a mouse-only point-and-click game where you play as a mouse living in a hole in the wall of an auditorium. Your goal is to traverse the maze of instruments and such on-stage and find cheese to bring home to your three baby mice children. Simple, right? Wrong! Unfortunately for you, a stray cat has wondered in and has decided to make your life very difficult. Now you must carefully sneak around stage and avoid the cat. You can pluck the stringed instruments and make a quick escape to lure the cat in the wrong direction, but watch out for falling brass and woodwinds that will block your path. And beware of the spoiled cheese, it is deceptively similar to the fresh stuff!</p><p>Art and Programming by Jessica Balfe</p><p>Music Composition and Audio Implementation by Sai</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b4362f9d59a72f2d8c3a10c2d8a4c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jessica R.
