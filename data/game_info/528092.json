(Game Grumps Fan Game)", "description": "https://Ko-fi.com/mitchellhepburn\r\n<p>So I watch the Game Grumps a lot while I'm developing games n stuff, and I thought for Halloween 2020 I'd make like a little spooky fan game thing just for fun. It took waaaay too long because I got carried away adding stuff, but that's good because it means more content for you guys!</p>\n<p>The game takes place in the old Grump office that they had in 2017. And\u00a0this game is\u00a0kind of a parody of P.T. but you probably won't notice the resemblance at first. In the second half of the game it\u00a0has (telegraphed) jump-scares so maybe turn your volume down if headphones are your thing!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The plot of the game is simple. Arin needs a shit but things quickly spiral out of control.</p>\n<p>The game doesn't have an ending, it just sort of procedurally generates forever and you have to see how long you can last. There is however a secret unlockable hard mode you can get if you can find enough hidden Bad Boy Coins. It is recommended you try and go for that because there's more game dude! Have fun!</p>\n\r\nhttps://Ko-fi.com/mitchellhepburn\r\nhttps://Patreon.com/CyberscapeCity\r\nhttps://Twitter.com/CyberscapeCity\r\nhttps://Facebook.com/CyberscapeCity\r\n\n<p>Controller compatible, but only displays the icon for an Xbox controller.</p>\n<p>Typical sort of control scheme, WASD for keyboard.</p>\n<p>Sprint using Shift or by pressing down the Left Analogue Stick on your controller.</p>\n<p>R is the reset the game button, or down on the D-Pad. It will make a thing happen and can be used at any point in the game.</p>\n<p>1234 changes the graphics quality. If you want to see what the Grump Office would look like on PS1, press 4.</p>\n<p>There are button prompts to teach you the rest of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>(At the moment I'm only able to build the game for Windows, I'll try and fix that at some point when I have time).</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Soundtrack:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Long play (not including the secret unlockable mode):</strong></p>\r\n\r\nhttps://Ko-fi.com/mitchellhepburn\r\nhttps://Patreon.com/CyberscapeCity\r\nhttps://Twitter.com/CyberscapeCity\r\nhttps://Facebook.com/CyberscapeCity", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5dacdcb58d3f276dd7e5ff3ad88bc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheropie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
