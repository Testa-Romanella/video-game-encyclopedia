Once you've plundered the area for as many valuables as you can hold, run back safely to your base or risk losing it all and starting again empty handed. The more swag you have in tow once you get back to your base, the more points you're rewarded. Watch out though, the more you carry, the slower you get and the harder it becomes to avoid those who want their stuff back. Do you get as much as possible and risk getting caught? Or do you play it safe and pick small amounts at a time?\r\n</p>\n<p>Pick 'n' Pocket features a single and local multiplayer mode so you can try to beat your own high score or go head-to-head with a friend and see who the better thief is.</p>\n<p><strong>Controller Recommended - Xbox Control Scheme</strong></p>\n<p>D-Pad/Left Stick - Move</p>\n<p>A - Jump</p>\n<p>X - Use Item</p>\n<p>B - Action</p>\n<p>Start - Start/Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls - P1</strong></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - Move/Climb</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Q - Use Item</p>\n<p>E - Action</p>\n<p>Enter - Start/Pause\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls - P2</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Num 5,1,2,3 - Move/Climb</p>\n<p>Num 0 - Jump</p>\n<p>Num 4 - Use Item</p>\n<p>Num 6 - Action</p>\n<p>[+] -\u00a0Start/Pause</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Design/Art/Programming/Sound - Ron McCullough</p>\n<p>Music - Tim Herrick</p>\n<p><em>Voices</em></p>\n<p>Pick - James Skretteburg</p>\n<p>Pocket -\u00a0Araceli De La Santa Cruz</p>\n<p>Everything Else - Ron McCullough</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to the Cool Kids Discord Chat!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Be sure to leave comments, suggestions and found bugs/glitches!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8deafc91ec7379fca3a5cb5c5fdb91c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RonDMC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
