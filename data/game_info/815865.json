You have to dodge the walls and the balls that the towers throw at you, since the latter take your life away. Hearts give you life. When you run out of life you will play a game where you have to guess the hidden card. If you find it you can continue playing and if you lose it you have to start over from scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T08:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/949fd6ab87cccab289062f4871bd79b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jhonny6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
