Once you have an idea of who the murderer is and their motive, you can visit the Fortune Teller to see if you can put the ghost to rest. There are several suspects in town, and you can confirm the alibis of all the characters except for one. There's no limitation on how many times you can guess but you can't leave town until you solve the mystery.... also\u00a0we forgot to add a quit button....</p>\n<p>Development: My wife and I built this game for Godot Wild Jam #54, with the theme \"curses\". After finding out the theme, we took a walk through a graveyard to find spooky inspiration, and it worked! We wanted to create a puzzle game where you match information on people's graves with details from the townspeople to solve a mystery. However, the townspeople provided more than enough material. My wife was interested in making a Japanese-style horror game, while I wanted to create something more akin to Scooby Doo mixed with the X-Files. We combined our ideas, and Grimstone was born.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T15:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/1649472c2ca86e32cee169160012aae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maroderkon", "Chizilla"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
