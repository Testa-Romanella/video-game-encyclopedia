You can assemble a mech consisting of various modules that can also be destroyed individually in combat.</p>\n<p>Carry out missions and proceed to your next destination. Fight your way trough hordes of space monsters and customize your mech with the loot you find... or end up being eaten up by space monsters.<br/></p>\n<p>The current version is lacking missions (just 2 basic missions are available). Most features are implemented. More missions will be added later on.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Made with Godot engine.<br/>Programming:<br/>- Viktor Hahn</p>\n<p>Graphics:<br/>- Stephen Challener (Redshrike)<br/>- OceansDream<br/>- Viktor Hahn</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>- Metaruka<br/>- SketchyLogic<br/>- Juhani Junkala</p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/>- Juhani Junkala</p>\n<p>Font:<br/>- Jonas Hecksher</p>\n<p>thx @ eugeneloza for naming suggestion<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1172c2b65f36689ec6fce97c9593b2fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Viktor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
