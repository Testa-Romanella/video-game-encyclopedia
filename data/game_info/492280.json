I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make you laugh at least once!</ul><ul>- On screen encounters.</ul><ul>- Hug your way to victory!</ul><h3>You need to know!</h3>Because of a certain script that I use, the game will most likely drop frames in twilight town when an enemy has it's sights on you. I'm sorry but I needed this script and it was a learning experience for me. I'm sorry again.<br/><br/><br/>This is also a short game that should take approx 3 hours to finish. Take it as a one off game as it will be a while before I get back to making the other parts. Take this game as a piece of art that you can enjoy and experience and most importantly, have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:41:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe8/fe8436c2bb112ea992188924d1705c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wallace Lovecraft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wallace Lovecraft"], "esrb_rating": null}
