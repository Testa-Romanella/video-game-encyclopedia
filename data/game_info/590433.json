I have been making this game by myself for several years. It is not always possible to find the time for a hobby, so the game is still in the development. If you have the opportunity to support me as well as this project - follow me in a social media and make a donation, I am thankful to everyone who will support me. This can help me finish the development of this game, and also it will expedite the development of my new projects, which I will announce in the near future. For all questions, bugs, suggestions and cooperation please contact me via email or Twitter. Thanks for your attention.</p>\n<p>Become my patron:\u00a0www.patreon.com/vineyardpictures</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0www.twitter.com/vin0pic</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0www.vineyard.pictures</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2bd2ad7fcac4d72b119f2f8a9294b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vineyard Pictures"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
