Right now the game engine is almost completed, and I need help getting started on some great puzzle ideas. You can make levels in the level editor and post them on the discord server, as well as play and modify anybody else's level too.</p>\n<p><strong>You cannot save/load levels in the online version, so keep that in mind. Eventually there will be a ton of premade levels you can play, for now there are only 5.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/73KStfE<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>In the game, WASD are the only controls needed. You can also press Escape to quit before completing the level.</p>\n<p>In the level editor, you click your mouse to place/delete objects. Q or E to change tool, and W or S to change what you are placing. Click the save button and copy the text in the box and paste it in the discord server to share, paste a levels string into the box and press load to play someone else's level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game mechanics(I am bad at explaining, try it out and you'll probably understand!):</strong></p>\n<p>Goal: Get all \"souls\" to posses a torch.</p>\n<p>There are entities in each level. An entity cannot move by default, but if it gets possessed by a \"soul\" it will be controlled by the player. A \"soul\" can move from one object to another.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c89/c890305264ffcf497e55d9fa056bf716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TrolledWoods"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
