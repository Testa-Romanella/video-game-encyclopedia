This farming life isn't as calm and peaceful as you'd expect: to become the best farmer you will need unusual methods to prevent your enemies from succeding.<h3>FAST PACED</h3>Farm Your Friends matches lasts 5 minutes, making it a frenetic and chaotic experience. Try selling as much as you can to be the winner while facing other players. You have to find the balance between taking care of your farm and sabotaging the other's - but you won't have time to think it through.<h3>ITEMS</h3>You will not only receive rake, watering can and other tools for taking care of your farm, but also unexpected items that lead you to the victory. You'll receive crates containing bombs, handcuffs, boxing gloves, beartraps and many more! But don't worry, there will be defensive items too, such as spike fences and scarecrows to keep other players away from you and your crops. Remember to always watch your step so you don't fall in bomb traps or hidden springs on the ground.<h3>RANDOM EVENTS</h3>Beware of random events: they may be useful, confusing or even dangerous. It starts raining so now all your crops are watered, and that's great, but can you tell if it is a rainstorm? Is there a chance that a bolt will hit you?<h3>CHARACTERS</h3>Choose the character that fits you the best, from a farmer boy to a literal scarecrow. You can also unlock even more unusual characters, such as a snowman and an astronaut.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/813351ff120fb06a0529d17ae2e79a24.jpg", "website": "https://meganeuragames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meganeura Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meganeura Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
