Some came here to test themselves, others for the Keeper's Eggs, the key to immense wealth. Most of them ended up feeding the Keeper with their souls, adding to her strength before they managed to get a single golden egg. The more daring set out on the way to the Cursed Land, and those who dared to step ahead were aware that the demons they would encounter were powerful enough to inflict endless suffering on them. This power was a veil that covered the eyes of those who wanted to dominate it. Many eyes blinded by his veil came here to make a deal with the Satan himself, and none of them were heard from. Only one person knew what really happened here: You can't make a deal with the devil! The only way to gain more power was to steal his soul. And that person set off... Who known as the Demon Master!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>ESC - Menu (A - D to change pages)</li><li>W A S D - Movement</li><li>Space - Dash, Evade</li><li>Left M.
