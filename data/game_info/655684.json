Thought of a last minute Idea for the Theme, Let There be Chaos, and was able to fit in enough time to create a game.</p>\n<p>In Hexaply, you are to get as high of a score as possible. You can only gain score by clicking on the hexagons that are ready to multiply. If you don't multiply the hexagon fast enough the Hexagon is destroyed and you loose score. Good luck and have fun!</p>\n<p>Expected play time is roughly 1~2 minutes, and you can fast quit at anytime using the Escape Key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T18:44:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/128ca2a826d3d95f28478734ac13622a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel Tupy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
