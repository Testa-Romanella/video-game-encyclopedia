{"id": 625489, "slug": "maze-of-the-mad-minds", "name": "Maze of the Mad Minds", "name_original": "Maze of the Mad Minds", "description": "<p>This is a maze puzzle game that was created in Game Maker Studio 2. The objective is to connect the two pieces together. But there is a\u00a0catch: their movement is joined\u00a0together so when one moves the other moves in the same direction making it impossible to catch each other. The player will have to use the walls to \"trap\" a piece allowing the other to go and meet it. So far there are only three different tiles:</p>\n<p>Wall - Does not move and prevents the pieces from moving into them.</p>\n<p>Red X - If a piece hits this tile, the level is restarted</p>\n<p>Teleporter - The teleporters are connected by the arrow direction, left goes to left, up goes to up. Watch out for \"one-way\" teleporters that have a Red X on one side!</p>\n\n<p>This idea came to me during the GMTK 2021 Game Jam that had the theme: \"Joined Together\" which took place in the middle of the Amaze Me Game Jam. I decided to scrap my ongoing project and go with this one instead because I really like the idea. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome and encouraged!</p>\n<p>If you do happen to beat the game, tell me the secret code at the end as proof ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e6d6f470176d9dbf87041a88229888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke__Bacon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
