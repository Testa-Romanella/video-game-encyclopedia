It's about a fox who has the ability to pause elements around them! This can mean pausing projectiles around you to use them as platforms to get to higher elevation or pausing enemies to make them open for attack from above. With the power of time in your hands, you can do anything.</p>\n<p>As a solo game prototype made by someone who is primarily a programmer, art and sound was heavily borrowed from other sources like the Unity store or FreeSounds.org. Some even use the default Unity assets. Additionally, this game is only 1 level.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Main developer: Anthony Hoang (ZephyrTheZaunite)</li></ul>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul><li>SunnyLand 2D Unity Asset Pack:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349</li><li>Brackeys Mega 2D Pack:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/free-2d-mega-pack-177430</li><li>Player Jump Sound: https://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/262893/</li><li>Player Damaged Sound: https://freesound.org/people/marionagm90/sounds/220662/</li><li>Eagle Squawk: https://freesound.org/people/JackWilDesign/sounds/607902/</li><li>Eagle Flap: https://freesound.org/people/_stubb/sounds/389634/</li><li>Rat Death: https://freesound.org/people/egomassive/sounds/536753/</li><li>Frog Death: https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/447917/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T12:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e694569a8c1e30bbf677bab05781c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZephyrTheZaunite"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
