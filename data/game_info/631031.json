You have an arsenal of two miniguns and a flak gun to take on the waves of hostile forces. Your miniguns are your main defense against incoming projectiles, although they are weak against aircraft and have a limited range. Your long range option for dealing with aircraft is the flak gun, which will file a projectile that will detonate in the air destroying nearby enemies, excluding missiles.\r\n </p>\n<p> Victory is reached by destroying all enemies.</p>Controls: \r\n<ul><li> <p>Left Mouse Button for miniguns\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>Right Mouse Button for flak gun\r\n \r\n</p></li><li> <p>Esc to pause\r\n \r\n</p></li></ul><p>Developed with Godot Engine.</p><p>Source code and assets can be found at\u00a0https://codeberg.org/Samsai/incoming<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5905c7977ad7fc510075f8a45a12a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Samsai"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
