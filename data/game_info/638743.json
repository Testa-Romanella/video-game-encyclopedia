All materials come from the software itself and DLC, except two ending texts and a modified cover. <br/><br/>Originally intended as a gift to me, but the development cycle is far longer than my friend expected - no fishing. Although I missed the time, my friend still gained happiness, which is a sense of achievement when building his own small world, even if the external is insignificant. <br/><br/>Without using other plug-ins, we try our best to use the original event to design some common events in RPG, which proves that smile game builder, as a zero basis lightweight RPG development tool, is still complete and worthy of the name. <br/><br/>There are many places in the game that can be expanded, but my friend's hand itches and wants to abuse pixel game maker MV (pgmmv). Nevertheless, we can update some details from time to time to enrich the content of the game. <br/>If you are interested in joining the SGB \"army\" and have any questions about software learning, you can leave a message in the comment area, and we will answer the relevant questions according to the situation (absolutely not a video tutorial, not...)<h3>This game features</h3>Show the advantages and operability of SGB.<h3>Rich objects and scenes make you immersive </h3><h3>Excellent pictures make you happy</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>P.S.: <br/>The last hurdle in the development of this project is to delete the back door for testing. The workload is getting higher and higher because of my friend's carelessness. It really scares me to death. I thought it would be too late for me to draft those scripts. <br/><br/><br/><br/>P.P.S.: <br/>Some opinions in this work, some of them have feelings, some of them moan without illness, some of them exaggerate.
