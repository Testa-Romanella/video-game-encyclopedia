Dodge hazards, unleash weaponry, and avoid falling off the edge in a chaotic rush to the finish line, then bolt on new track pieces for the next round.<br/><br/>Scrap across ever-growing courses with increasingly perilous features until a winner is crowned before starting over with a brand-new course.<br/><br/><h3>Build your course</h3>Work together\u2014or against one another\u2014to quickly build tracks using a range of ridiculous pieces, including loops, seesaws, corkscrews, and even train crossings. Then add obstacles and power-ups. Ruin your friends\u2019 race with a well-placed barrier or jettison them off the side of a curve with a crafty boost-pad.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Blow up the competition</h3>Four racers jostle and shunt to cross checkpoints and reach the finish line. Obliterate opponents with a range of wacky weapons, including goo cannons and Tesla coils, but beware: each checkpoint acts as a respawn point and revenge is a dish best served via a giant mallet or rooftop-mounted shotgun\u2026<h3>Keep on truckin\u2019</h3>The finish line isn\u2019t the finish! Add new track pieces after each round to create monstrously large courses, and score bonus points with your performance to take home the trophy.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Add to your collection</h3>Unlock new track pieces and hazards for more dangerous course designs.
