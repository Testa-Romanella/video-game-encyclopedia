This new way is meant to give the player near infinite ways to experience the story the way they like. The implementation of the game nb engine in Night Builder prologus is a lite version of the complete engine which will be featured in the main game Night Builder. Night Builder prologus is meant to be a proof of concept for the engine and the Night Builder story/lore. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>The game is completely playable and is mostly free of bugs. But there will be a big performance Update and I might add other languages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Website: https://sites.google.com/view/aintelligence\r\n  </p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/AI_ntelligence\r\n  </p>\n<p>Discord: https://discordapp.com/widget?id=389157181033021452&amp;theme=dark<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc55f2ce7440db83c1b1f12b570a2ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruu AI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
