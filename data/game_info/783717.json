{"id": 783717, "slug": "falling-ball-snbs", "name": "Falling Ball (SNBS)", "name_original": "Falling Ball (SNBS)", "description": "<p>This is a game of the \"avoid obstacles\" genre. It has five levels, but <strong><em>don't think that's not enough! They all</em></strong> (except the first) <strong><em>are difficult</em></strong>, <em>and you won't pass them for ten minutes!</em> The game has also got a stars counter. When you pass a level, Falling Ball gets its number, subtracts 1 and adds the result to your number of stars, which is displayed in the main menu (as you can see, no stars are added for passing the first level because it's easy). So you can compete \u2014 who will get the biggest number of stars?<br/></p>\n<p>The game also plays a disturbing melody that you can turn off. In the package \"Falling Ball (level maps included).zip\", all the levels have maps, which can be opened from the main menu. They show the obstacles of the level.</p>\n<p><strong>To play the game, read the file \"Documentation.txt\", or else you won't know what do some\u00a0things mean</strong><strong>.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T14:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8f598ef8c18b0a5ae00e1fee9bdc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SNBS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
