In 1985, the game was featured prominently amongst the 18 titles at the Manhattan test market launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System, being demonstrated on a large projector screen by real Major League Baseball players. The game's launch position and the universal appeal of its namesake sport are said to have made Baseball a key to the NES's overall success, and an important piece of Nintendo history.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T02:00:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef1246629e588787d940592cb05416f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 16, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 14}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["NES", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
