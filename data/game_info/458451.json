Theme: Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>\n<p>Origami Katana turns the concept of Rock, Paper, Scissors! into a wave-based slug-fest in which you must balance aggression, time management, and maybe the odd bit of running away in order to make your way through waves of increasing difficulty to ultimately achieve the highest score!</p>\n\n<p>Evil has been unleashed in the world of Origami Katana! Your temple has been invaded by hostile forces of three kinds, and only your trusty arsenal can be used to defeat them. Obliterate the Scissor Soldiers with your <strong>Rock-It Launcher</strong>! Slice and dice the Granite Golems with the <strong>Origami Katana</strong>! Eviscerate the Paper Pillagers with <strong>Scissor Shurikens</strong>. Alternatively: mildly inconvenience your enemies by using the wrong weapon!</p>\r\nControls\r\nWForwardS\u00a0BackwardAStrafe LeftDStrafe RightMouse 1Attack / Menu Selection1Switch to the Rock-It Launcher2Switch to the Origami Katana3Switch to the Scissor ShurikensShiftSprintSpaceJumpEscPause\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Endless wave system</li><li>Dynamic music system</li><li>Three weapon systems (melee and projectile based)</li><li>Three enemy types</li><li>Enemy AI system that reacts to active weapon and player interaction</li><li>Complete pause system</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All names below did bits of everything, but our primary responsiblies were:</p>\n<ul><li>Dan Perry: Level Design, SFX, Particle Systems, Voice Over</li><li>James Lucas : Project Lead, Programming</li><li>Matt McCurdy: Level\u00a0Design, UI Assets</li><li>Rio Kisjantoro: 3D models, Animation,\u00a0Level Design</li><li>Ryan Baylis: Programming, Music, SFX</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b48b0869f4a4015dd8d4d64c17d8b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["necrosaint"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
