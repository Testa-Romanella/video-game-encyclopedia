We have a fix but obviously it'll have to wait until after the Jam period is over!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There's a working version of the game for Windows available here if you wanted to try it:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Windows executable version (v1.3) - download here</li></ul>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p><em>Made for the Extra Credits Game Jam 2020.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys or WASD to move</li><li>Spacebar - Action button</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>You need to keep your robot alive long enough to charge its laser and win the fight!</p>\n<p>During the fight round, pay attention to\u00a0your robot to see which part is damaged and what colour box needs the parts.<br/></p>\n<p>Get the right parts from the shelves and put them\u00a0in the right boxes to keep your robot in the fight, but mess it up and you\u2019ll take even more damage!</p>\n<p>Debris will slow you down - clear them\u00a0up debris by hitting the spacebar and just the right time.</p>\n<p>Your kid is also watching so don\u2019t mess it up!</p>\n<p>Charge your laser all the way up to win. Can you stay in the fight long enough to win?</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The panel in the top right corner shows your robots health, laser charge,\u00a0the current part you're holding and the remaining time in the round.</li><li>You are evaluated at the end of each repair round (yellow) clock. The boxes will flash green if they're correct, or red if you missed a part, or added any unneeded parts.</li><li>You can avoid the debris, but hitting it will require you to clear it</li><li>Be careful - adding extra parts will give your robot just as much damage as missing some.</li><li>Your kid doesn't do anything, but it's try not to bring shame to your family as he watches his dad at work.</li><li>Picked up the wrong part? You can use the bin to throw it away!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dev notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This is our first ever game, we were maybe a bit too ambitious with our scope, but we learned a lot working on it over the jam. Was great fun getting involved!</p><p>Credits:</p><p><strong>Art &amp; Animation</strong>:\u00a0Alexander Byatt (Byazzle)<br/><strong>Programming</strong>: Steve de Niese (LetterAfterZ)<br/></p><p>\"Division\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Additional sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d2137868116bfd12a44c0c87478607a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["byazzle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
