(DEMO) ZX Spectrum Next", "description": "<p>Brickz! is a \"Breakout\" style game created as a companion\u00a0for the Spriteworx YouTube video #45 demonstrating a game development workflow for creating a game from start to finish.\u00a0 This quick-and-dirty playable DEMO\u00a0is written in\u00a0un-optimized BASIC so it may not be the smoothest\u00a0in terms of gameplay but it contains 7 complete levels featuring screens from the upcoming full version themed level packs as well as some cool feature such as bombs and explosive bricks. It\u00a0is playable with keyboard or joystick and if you get a high score the game will save itself automatically.</p>\n<p>Follow Spriteworx on Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/gaming/Spriteworx\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help support me to develop more projects and earn cool rewards\u00a0by becoming a patron at:\u00a0https://patreon.com/Spriteworx</p>\r\nFollow my game development journey on YouTube:\r\n\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/Spriteworx", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T06:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e910f6c8ae4bf6d4de63fb22e0a9b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spriteworx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
