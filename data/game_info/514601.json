For this exercise, I imposed myself several constraints:\r\n- A maximum of 2 hours before rendering.\r\n\u00a0- Not allowed to use an existing project or watch Youtube's video. \r\n\u00a0- Don't ask for any help.\r\nThis exercise allowed me to better manage the pressure and to understand how this game became famous. We can consider it as a \"little rush\".\r\n\r\nThe game is easy to play, just click on the screen.\r\n\n<p>For the sprites I used this site : <br/></p>\n<p>- https://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sheet/59894/</p>\n<p>And for the font :\u00a0</p>\n<p>- https://www.dafont.com/04b-19.font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fb506b03f6dc7f5af654283920e3fe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loann Courcoul"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
