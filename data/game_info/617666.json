It's our first ever Game Jam and we wish everyone good luck and hope you had fun.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play the dog and pull your human, who is busy on his phone, out for a walk. The dog wants to defend his territory and protect his master from the obstacles of the walk. Since he is holding the dog's leash, you are restricted in your movement and have to be careful of the obstacles that cross your path. The more interactions you make, the more points you get.</p>\n<p>The theme of Game Jam is quite simple, since the dog and the human are \"connected\" by the dog leash.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3feb85beb4ae3ee55b70def97d375144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jandele"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
