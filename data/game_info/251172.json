They attacked the Demon God and he launched the Apocalypse on Earth as a vengeance. They have to climb the highest mountain to escape a sea of lava, throwing their accumulated experience points to each other to be seen as a weakling by the Demon God for his arrival.\"</p>\n<p>Game was made under 48 hours, we chose egality as a theme. The pedagogy here is to put one pride aside because it's not always the strongest who wins. And the game is spoken as a versus game but if you try to cooperate to climb together the story tells that both player wins by surpassing the Demon God.</p>\n<p>Gameplay Gif Here<br/></p>\n<p>*Two Controllers are required*\r\n</p>\n<p>Game done by :</p>\n<p>Decharneux Quentin (Gameplay + Level Design)<br/>Preudhomme Thomas (VFXs + Sound Design)<br/>Maldonado Andr\u00e8s (UI + Lava shader)<br/>Lebon Xavier (Artist)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa94675b5e7b40db8fe348e276c320cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["QuentinDecharneux"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
