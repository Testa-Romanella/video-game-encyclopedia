{"id": 326142, "slug": "cruiser-x-79", "name": "Cruiser-X 79", "name_original": "Cruiser-X 79", "description": "<p>The New Dimension, in co-op with Saul Cross, is very proud to produce a brand new fast paced vertical scrolling shoot 'em up for the good old 8-bit machine, the C64. ... and it wasn't even made with the SEUCK either - so never judge a book by its cover. The game has now been migrated to C64Studio.<br/></p>\n<p>At the moment, the<strong> </strong>game project is currently at its own early stages, but after a very long delay (due to a problem in the code) and the unexpected explosion bug is now fixed. Progress with the production has now continued. TND is very happy to present you a video of a test level game working.</p>\n<p>Once Cruiser X-79 has finished, the game will be available as a digital download for FREE on TND and also this page. There also may be in the future a digital download of a 1-level game preview for you to try out. Other plans for this game will be announced later in the future. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Story so far ...<br/></strong></p>\n<p>It is the year 2072. Just before a giant asteroid collided into Earth. A successful mission, where all good people were transported to Mars. The planet was only a temporary settlement until a new planet was discovered <strong>EarthX</strong>. It contained water, oxygen, gas, and was similar to Earth. This was discovered by Drone. <br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately one big challenge awaits. A few people tried to travel to EarthX, but they failed.\u00a0 They accidentally flew into an alien war zone. The Aliens had captured their unarmed ships and destroyed everyone on board. We need transport to move the remaining people to the planet. Behold the <strong>Cruiser</strong>-<strong>X 79</strong><strong>,\u00a0</strong>a powerful super-charged battle cruiser, which can wipe out anything on sight.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You fly out of Mars and attempt to take your people towards EarthX. You are near some alien bases, but as you tried to pull away from them in order to head to EarthX. A magnetic pulse drags you to the alien base. Where your ship gets captured, and sealed inside  a prison base. You use the supercomputer on your ship and you manage to break free from the base. Now, you must face the ultimate fate.... War!</p>\n<p><strong>Playing the game<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Your mission is to help guide your Cruiser-X 79 escape from being captured by the aliens and reach safely to EarthX. Unfortunately your mission will not be all that easy. You have entered a war zone. The aliens accept nothing, unless you are destroyed. <br/></p>\n<p>Fly through 16 levels, of alien territory, and fight the aliens. Warning... aliens will fight back by dropping lasers downwards. Be very careful not to hit the aliens, or high buildings on each base. It will cost you destruction. After the ship gets destroyed, it will be repaired and working once again. If destroyed too many times, then you will be doomed forever.</p>\n<p>During your fight, there's cargo which you can steal, that will help you slightly through your battle. The cargo awards you different power ups. These are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>B </strong>= Smart bomb. If you carry one of those, the bomb icon will appear on screen. Using SPACEBAR will activate it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>L </strong>= Extra life. If you pick up one of these, you will gain extra lives</p>\n<p><strong>M </strong>= Master blaster - Powers up your fire power</p>\n<p><strong>S </strong>= Shield - Gives you protection against the aliens for a temporary time</p>\n<p>You can also attack the enemy bases by shooting at some of the buildings, which will destroy them.</p>\n<p>Can you save your people, by attacking all 16 alien bases and winning the war against the aliens. Or will you face death?</p>\n<p>Good luck. You will need it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Programming: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics and design: <strong>Saul Cross</strong><br/>Tape Turbo Loader source:\u00a0 <strong>Martin Piper</strong><br/>Exomizer source: <strong>Magnus Lind</strong><br/>Sound Effects and Music: <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(C)2019 The New Dimension<br/></p>\n<p>*** <strong>DOWNLOAD UNAVAILABLE ***<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T20:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca81a99e53bde711fa5461380cf2da47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
