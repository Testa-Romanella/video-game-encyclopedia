You are provided with three tools in order to accomplish this: an x-ray, hammer, and a drill.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0The x-ray allows you to see the fossil trapped in the rock.</em><br/><em>\u00a0The hammer allows you to break through the toughest layers of rock. However, if you use it too much, you will potentially break the fossil.</em><br/><em>\u00a0The drill allows you punctured holes through the rock and (if you are not careful) the fossil.</em></p>\n\r\nMeet XK4-V8, he is here to guide you on your fossil digging journey. If you have any questions, just ask him<br/>\n\n<p><strong>When you're finished playing the demo, please answer the questions below with your most HONEST opinion.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1.
