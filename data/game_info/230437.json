Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. <br/><br/>Serious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. <br/><br/>NoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d7046ba08eee669aa56006f5edfbb5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Azati"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
