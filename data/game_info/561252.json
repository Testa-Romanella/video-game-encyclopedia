Your player will be able to move in any direction for 1 second and after that, it will stop for 1 second also. (Kinda like a hopping movement and fits for slime movements)</p>\n<p>Establish your kingdom by gathering blue friendly slimes to increase your strength and defeating all red enemy slimes.</p>\n<p>Small blue slime - gives you 1 strength to defeat a small red enemy slime.</p>\n<p>Normal blue slime - if you have 1 strength, it can give you 1 more\u00a0 strength to defeat small and normal red enemy slimes. You will be having 2 strengths for that.</p>\n<p>Large blue slime - if you have 2 strengths, it can give you overpowered strength, making you formidable to all red enemy slimes.</p>\n<p>That's all and enjoy my game!
