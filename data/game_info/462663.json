Had time for only one level and honestly it's not hard nor challenging, but I'm proud of it.\u00a0<br/><br/>I had to resign from several additional ideas like clone, time warp, water mechanics. It all works, it's all spaghetti but it's my spaghetti and I'm damn proud of my agonizing 36 hours of work. The sound is turned down pretty much, so noone's ear should be blasted off.<br/><br/>Use A, D, Space and Right Mouse to play, and all the feedback is welcome as it's my first ever Game\u00a0Jam.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!<br/>~DaWiHs<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T05:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13b90a3a125fbbd68eb23ba699e3d4c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaWiHs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
