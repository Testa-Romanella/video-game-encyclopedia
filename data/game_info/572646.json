Probably buggy as hell but I think the main loop works!<br/><br/>*AHEM*<br/><br/>The far right knows their number is up. As usual, they've decided to do a bunch of hateful shit and blame the left. Luckily, the punks are onto them. <br/></p>\n<p>Take to the streets with yr pals and battle a repulsive smorgasbord of fascists: cops, nazis, technocrats, preppers, lone gunmen, and cyberdogs.<br/><br/>Survive fourteen nights of fisticuffs, bonfires, toxic waste spills, and incendiary devices. If you make it, lay the groundwork for a hopefully less awful world. If you don't, brush up on yr anarchist theory and try again. In the immortal words of someone, don't stop til every nazi skull is crushed!<br/><br/>(CONVERGER is an extremely bad name but makes \"sense\" because most of this code is cribbed from VERGER, another game I'm chipping away it. Just let me have this, OK?)<br/><br/>*NOTE: If you just want to play the game, please download the latest version (0.2 as of this moment). If you're a juror for 7DRL and want the original build uploaded for the jam, it's 0.1. thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf44717cc41a08c1fcfb34b509cbdde6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["-hexcavator-"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
