That means you don't have to choose between being a warrior, a mage, a harvester or a crafter. You can improve your skills in all these classes with only one character; you do not need to focus on one path. For example, you can, at your leisure, either train your pike handling, put on your magic amplifiers to heal or cast offensive spells, pick up your pickaxe and harvest materials, or go into crafting a new armor or weapon.<br/><br/>You have absolute freedom!RoleplayRyzom offers official interactive events (with live NPC's), regular and varied, that evolve according to your actions. Nothing is preordained!<br/>Would you like to create your own event?
