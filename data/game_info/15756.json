Drawing on elements of Southern Gothic and using settings of derelict towns, run-down motels and murky, decaying swamps, A Chair in a Room will take you through an investigation of institutional corruption, religious immorality and murder, which can only be unlocked by searching deep within your own psyche. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA calibration room will allow you get comfortable in VR but once you call the elevator, you begin your story as patient no. 6079 in The Greenwater Institute, with no recollection of who you are or what you did to be here. Dark visions bring your lucidity into question and only the doctor\u2019s supply of medication can suppress those who wish to haunt you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay is a seamless weave of interaction and narrative that wraps exploration and tense horror in rich environmental storytelling to create something that is unique to VR. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe story is broken down into six chapters of around 20 to 30 minutes in length to allow for intervals in play while enjoying the story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4dd4d1fae33299f4399a36714b79b9c.jpg", "website": "http://www.achairinaroom.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 62, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Wolf & Wood Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wolf & Wood Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
