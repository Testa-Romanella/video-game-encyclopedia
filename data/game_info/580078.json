When the game starts, incoming ships will appear from the top of the screen and try to make it through your defenses. You have 3 differently coloured radar jammers you can use to send signals to incoming enemy ships to jam their communications and destroy them. You must choose the correct coloured jammer for the incoming ships, then swipe the screen to attack. If a ship makes it past you , you will lose health. If you choose the wrong colour jammer for a ship and attempt to jam it you will lose health. After swiping to attack a ship you will need to release the touch in order to reload your weapon.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>When playing, press the colours at the bottom of the screen to choose your weapon.
