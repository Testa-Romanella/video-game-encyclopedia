In missions like \"Bone and Pillage,\" BoneCraft brings a whole new meaning to 'wingman,' as Captain Fort Worth will not only try to get laid himself, but make sure his Wranglers get theirs too.<br/><br/><br/>New types of girls and sex positions can be unlocked or purchased by advancing through the storyline. If the player would rather not fight before they get it on, they can visit the Sex Store and find just the right hookup from the hundreds of unique girls.<br/><br/><br/>You start with a rifle, a flamethrower, and a chainsaw sword, but new weapons can be purchased, stripped off enemies, or found hidden in the world., And that's not all: You're  also able to level up your team's's armor and weapons, to create the best Wrangler attack squad in any solar system. You'll need all the fire power you can get as you take on the crude magic of the Orcs and the overpowering mystical skill of the Elven Army.<br/><br/><br/>Drawn from dregs of the galaxy and put under the command of the drunkest rattlesnake-fucker this side of the Milky Way, the Space Wranglers booze their way from planet to planet in search of the hottest aliens out there.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The story begins with Captain Fort Worth (Neil Kaplan) and his trusty sidekick, Lubbock, cruising through space in their ship the USS Longstreet. As is normal on the ship, they are drinking massive amounts of Jet Fuel, which leads Lubbock to slip and bring up a subject he knows sends Fort into a rage: Elven women. Earlier in Fort\u2019s galactical campaigns he almost had the chance to bone the crown jewel of the galaxy, the Elf Queen, but was foiled by the Elven Army. Since then, Fort has lived with the pain of the only one he ever let get away.<br/><br/>Lubbock\u2019s mention of the Elves throws Fort into a drunken driving rage, and he sends the ship hurtling into an asteroid belt, putting it on a collision course with a hostile planet.<br/><br/>The Wranglers crash-land on the planet, and find it inhabited by an Orc tribe who they very quickly try to enforce their interstellar extinction policy on. Fort soon discovers that the Orc tribe is not only led by an old friend of his, but that the planet is also harboring an Elven Brothel run by the Elf Queen herself. Reluctant to share this info with his old friend, Fort is forced to go to war to find the secret of the Elven Brothel\u2019s location. <br/><br/>With his sights set on the prize, not even the Elven Army,  Dick Monsters, or mutinous Wranglers will stand in the way of Fort mounting his great white whale.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b80c3c6e5843d6ff3777bceac1b08bc.jpg", "website": "http://bonecraft.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 98, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 604, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D-Dub Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["D-Dub Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
