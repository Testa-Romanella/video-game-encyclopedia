The game was then polished up over 2 months before its current release onto Itch. Due to some uncontrollable life events, the artist was never able to finish up on his initial designs and that cobbled with new projects taken on by the development team lead to the project being put on indefinite hold. Rather than sit on the project, Hidden Productions decided it would be better to release it to the world in its current state at no cost, so that others could see the work an maybe be inspired to try something new.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f77/f77e917643b90783a887e802ef8cacd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HiddenProductions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
