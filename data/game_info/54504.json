The game was released in North America on October 31, 1999, and in Europe on December 17, 1999. This was the first game developed by Sucker Punch. In the game the player takes control over Rocket, the titular robot. Rocket: Robot on Wheels is notable for being the first game on a home platform to use a realistic physics engine to drive the gameplay. The player is required to solve puzzles dealing with mass, inertia, friction, and other physical properties. The game had been developed under the title Sprocket until three months before its release, when it was changed due to a trademark conflict with Game Sprockets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/679b7a00fd08ce26da7cc147592580b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Sucker Punch Productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
