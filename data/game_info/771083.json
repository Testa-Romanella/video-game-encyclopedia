We are unsure why, but it works perfectly fine for some people but causes problems for others.</p>\n<p>- The capsule collision of the character can make it act weird while dashing (in/on walls) or while jumping. (jumping and hitting your head on a corner can make you jump higher)</p>\n<p>- The moving platforms can sometimes act weird: They get confused when the player jumps on them and try to return to their starting point.\u00a0(This has been fixed, although some players may still encounter this bug)</p>\n<p>- The pressure plates will sometimes not respond if the player steps on them continuously.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/186a440147fa49598e9f9a977a05c668.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Breda University of Applied Sciences", "Ana Stefan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
