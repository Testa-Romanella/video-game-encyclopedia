Once you've lost enough and are barely alive, you can make it to the exit :D</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I didn't have the time to create more than 7 small levels, so the game is very short :(<br/>I also would've liked to add some more traps and object interactions, but maybe I will do that in the future some day.
