It is inspired by titles such as P.T. and indie developer Kittyhorrorshow's game Anatomy.\u00a0 It also draws inspiration from Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide. The retro, low-res aesthetic of the game is inspired by the work of Finnish indie developer Toni Kortelahti, better known as 98DEMAKE, who was kind enough to get in touch during development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For normal zip:</p>\n<p>The WASD keys are used to move, the arrow keys to look around and the enter key to interact when prompted.<br/></p>\n<p>For mouse support:</p>\n<p>The WASD keys are used to move, the mouse to look around and the mouse button to interact when prompted.</p>\n<p>Assets and audio by me.
