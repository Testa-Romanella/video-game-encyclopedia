{"id": 286218, "slug": "advance-plants", "name": "Advance Plants", "name_original": "Advance Plants", "description": "<p>This is a cool turn based tactics game where you lead a group of five dour hard-asses who have SEEN IT ALL enter an alien atmosphere with nothing but their fierce aquacannons and their wits, in a mission to water the three holy (we believe they are holy in some fashion, possibly) SUNFLOWERS. Watering the sunflowers will make everyone very(!) happy. Beware though, because the fierce Bur-Gun aliens will fire Burs at us until we are forced to leave the mission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoy games like Advance Wars or X-Com, you're sure to love ADVANCE PLANTS.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS: </strong>Happy Snake did the programming and the in-game art. Keith did the game design, the music and sounds, and the horrible grotesque paintings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you want to support\u00a0 Keith and Snake, please do so at one of our Patreon accounts below!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>http://www.patreon.com/keithburgun\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>http://www.patreon.com/happysnakegames\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/3496b964c7f66cf925e0f7f7f2eeb178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keith Burgun Games", "HappySnakeGames", "Keith & Snake Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
