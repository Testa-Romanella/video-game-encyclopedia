And to get to know itch io community :)\u00a0This is sadly all I can wrap up in 2 days development.<br/><br/>Basically still just a mining(?) rock hitting and loot collecting simulator. Initially planned for each character to request specific items through puzzle player must complete, then warp to a different place. Basically like magic school bus on VR. Game ideas are very welcome!</p>\n\n<p>Assets are currently from Google Poly and Kenny Free Assets. No sounds or effects yet :(<br/><br/>Controls: hit rock with pickaxe! press A or primary button to change right hand, press grip to teleport with left hand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/524b53c64f8c819ca0dad7d8578583ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["kukuhbr"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
