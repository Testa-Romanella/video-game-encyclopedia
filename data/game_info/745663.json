The gameplay is based on <em>iterations</em> - periodically every N seconds the\u00a0iteration brings random resources to the inventory.</p>\n<p>The iteration time depends on the amount of\u00a0 items in\u00a0the inventory (and <em>upgrades</em>, see the upgrades section). Each item has a <em>weight</em> and the more overall weight\u00a0of the inventory, the longer iterations will be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mining robot has a fuel tank.\u00a0Fuel periodically spent to maintain its functionality and must be renewed with certain refueling resources (<em>Coal\u00a0</em>and <em>Uranus</em> at the moment). Also\u00a0 fuel tank corrupts as the time passes, so the fuel consumption becomes larger.</p>\n<p>If the fuel reaches zero the robot stops functioning and the game ends. As you play, you will meet merchants who you can sell the accumulated resources / buy upgrades or fuel for the robot.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to earn 1 000 000\u00a0\u0394 (in-game currency) before you run out of fuel.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>=== Controls/Shortcuts</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>D</em> - quick drop selected items from inventory menu\r\n</p>\n<p><em>F</em> - quick refuel\r\n</p>\n<p><em>A -\u00a0</em>select all items in the inventory\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Ctrl -</em> deselect all items in the inventory and equipment section\r\n</p>\n<p><em>E</em>\u00a0<strong>(may be some minor\u00a0bugs)</strong> -\u00a0<em>When items in inventory selected\u00a0</em>move equipabble items from inventory to equipment menu,\u00a0<em>when items in the equipment section\u00a0</em>selected deequip items\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Alt</em> - show/hide information about the cost/weight of the one item from the stack</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>=== Upgrades</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two types of upgrades avaible for purchase at the current time: <em>mining boosters </em>and <em>mining modules</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mining boosters decrease the time of iterations and the mining modules allow the mining robot go deeper and collect more various resources.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1e56b06bece06c74da8eb6f7a7967f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wwhhooami"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
