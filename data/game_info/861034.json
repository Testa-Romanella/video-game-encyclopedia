This would include alcohol, mixers, toppings and ice, and customers would request one of a variety of options and combinations. Gradually, subtle story elements would be introduced via the use of recurring characters, that the player can either assist or hinder, as well as a wider variety of ingredients and harder combinations.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Currently in-game are extremely basic animations, which display how items would quickly move around the environment while playing, as well as a blockout for the surrounding environment, including seating areas, shelves and lighting.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Produced by:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>-Trinity Harvey\r\n  </li><li>-Safiya Hay\r\n  </li><li>-Joe \u2018Avery\u2019 Chamberlain\r\n  </li><li>-Bertas Jasiunas Hempson\r\n  </li><li>-Joey Wild\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T20:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de61be94998910987b70e735f0aaf98f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DragonFlyInAHat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
