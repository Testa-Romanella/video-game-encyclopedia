Each run through will take about one to three hours, roughly, with each game creating a new world for you to explore with your kitty avatar. The spells, the items, everything is randomized. But each time you play, several guidelines stay the same.</p>\n<p>Like all classic RPG's in the 8bit era of Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and Phantasy Star, the quest is simple. Find the magic item in one of the dungeons that will kill the Big Bad Evil(tm) and free the world. Oh no, but the final dungeon is locked! Fear not, brave kitty, there is a key hidden in another dungeon, scattered across the landscape. Find that, open the door, and save the world</p>\n<p>At the end of each play through you are given statistics of everything you did and experienced, as well as a fun personality profile for your kitty based on your actions.</p>\n<p>Short, sweet, and fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T21:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d2139e88de3382cb2512af9f24eceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Riddle Fox Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
