Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\nExploration-driven gameplay<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems\u2014such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious M\u00e2ruba swamp\u2014creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nMeaningful Narrative<br/>\n<br/>\nStep into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher. Together, you confront the recurring infection\u2014called \u201cthe withering\u201d by the local race of Naam\u2014threatening Ava\u2019s inhabitants. The game's narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet's captivating secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\nSaving Through Understanding<br/>\n<br/>\nCreatures of Ava is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet\u2019s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you\u2019ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, can you save something you don't understand?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-08T02:02:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0d3a8797668e071c32e3b96813811a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inverge Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["11 bit studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
