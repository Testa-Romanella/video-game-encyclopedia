Your task is to discover powerful cards, build your deck and enter battle with the sinister creatures of Aea.<br />\nDuring your adventure, you will engage in a challenging loop of battling new enemies, developing fresh tactics, evolving your cards and re-tuning your decks to achieve victory.<br />\nDECK BUILDING AND BATTLES<br />\nSkillful deck building is crucial in Cabals: Card Blitz. The game features a wide array of stunning, HAND PAINTED CARDS to collect, each with their own unique powers and abilities. You\u2019ll need to choose the right combination of cards to defeat different opponents, who all have their own battle strategies.<br />\nIn battle, your cards are drawn automatically and face off against the enemy cards, introducing an exciting chance factor into a skill-based game. After a first battle, you\u2019ll know your enemy\u2019s deck. What\u2019s the probability you should beat it with the correct combination of cards? How many battles should it take you to win?<br />\nThanks to the speed slider in battle, you\u2019re in control of how quickly the action happens. Crank it up to maximum for SUPER-FAST 30 SECOND BATTLES, or take it slower to focus on the abilities of your opponent. If you lose a battle, it\u2019s back to the Deck Editor to re-tune your deck for a different strategy, and then leap back into the action.<br />\nAs you collect more cards you\u2019ll use the Anvil to evolve them, creating more powerful versions of your cards. And once you\u2019ve unlocked CARD FUSION, your options expand dramatically, with super powerful new cards to be forged.<br />\nSINGLE PLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER MODES<br />\nCabals: Card Blitz features a rich, single-player adventure mode alongside an instant multiplayer mode. Whether you want to focus on exploring Aea and discovering new cards or on taking on other players in PvP battles is entirely up to you.<br />\nIn the single player mode, you will explore a map of the alternate world of Aea, a vast realm of scorching deserts, icy plains and lethal rain forests. You choose your own path through this world, unlocking new regions by completing battles. You can also conquer strongholds, which will generate daily rewards for you in the form of gold, new cards, and valuable gems. As you proceed through Aea the battles become progressively tougher, ensuring you always have a challenge to face.<br />\nThe player versus player mode sits right alongside single player, so your deck and characters can be used in both. PvP mode in Cabals: Card Blitz is designed to guarantee you always have opponents to face, as you can play against offline rivals. This means NO WAITING around in lobbies for invitations to be accepted, or disappointment if other players drop out of battle halfway through. PvP mode is a great way to test out your deck, earn gold, and climb the leaderboard. And, if another player challenges your deck and you win, you pick up rewards as well!<br />\nWHO IS THE GAME FOR?<br />\n\u2022 CCG PLAYERS who enjoy the challenge of learning about card abilities and building powerful decks<br />\n\u2022 RPG PLAYERS who relish levelling up their characters and fighting weird creatures<br />\n\u2022 ADVENTURE GAMERS who love exploring unique universes and appreciate beautiful artwork<br />\n\u2022 MULTITASKERS!
