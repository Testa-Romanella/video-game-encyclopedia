You will start with a fire spell which summons a sword made of fire that can be used to light torches and deal damage to enemies. During the game, you will find the wind spell, which pushes enemies away and puts out fire. Using both of these spells at the same time results in the fire boomerang, which sends out a spinning sword to the other side of the room that can deal damage to enemies and collect faraway items.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p>**This is a small part of an\u00a0ongoing project that I am actively developing.
