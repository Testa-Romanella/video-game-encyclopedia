We've cleared the area!</p>\n<p>Now we need to plant the seeds</p>\n<p>Be careful! Cleared land is overgrown after 15 seconds</p>\n<p>In the lower right corner you see a bag of seeds</p>\n\n<p>Drag it to the landing site and release!</p>\n\n<p>You will see how the seeds are poured into the garden, in a second you will have seeds!</p>\n<p>Plants have 4 stages of growth, each one changes after 15 seconds, but we do not want to wait long, so we take a watering can and pour it on the plant to move on to the next stage<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This stage is the last one, sell it by clicking on it and get the well-deserved coins<br/></p>\n\n<p>If your budget exceeds 50 coins, then you can buy a new plot by clicking on it</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations, you are now trained!
