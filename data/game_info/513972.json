I created it originally to see what my sprites would look like, but had a lot of fun, so I developed it further. In the current version there are two stages, a boss-fight centric stage, and a test stage. Please note that this version is likely going to be VERY buggy, and as of now there is no way to change volume of sounds/music in-game, except by changing the volume in Volume Mixer or using the volume keys/slider. There is also no way to rebind the controls, and thus, the game will probably not work that well with a gamepad.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nIf you find any bugs, make sure to let me know about them on Reddit (MrMrAltAccount1000) or the comment section.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 10/31/20: Fixed a ton of pause-related bugs in Sasha's fight.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T05:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447378fa60fa6633500fac3a7e4169e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMrAltAccount1000"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
