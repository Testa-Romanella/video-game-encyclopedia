In one last effort to save our species,\u00a0three interstellar missions were assembled, aiming to send astronaut crews to some of the closest potentially habitable exoplanets, hoping that one of them harbors conditions that allow humanity to move there permanently.</p>\n<p>You take the role of an astronaut present in one of these missions, embarking on a journey to the closest exoplanet to Earth -\u00a0<strong>Proxima Centauri b</strong>. However, not everything goes to plan, and you'll have to struggle to survive while uncovering the planet's secrets, and maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to save humanity.</p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMinimum:\r\n<ul><li>64-bit Processor: Intel Core i3\u00a0or equivalent</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Intel UHD Graphics 620 or equivalent (integrated graphics unit)</li><li>Storage: 3.2 GB available space</li></ul>\r\nRecommended:\r\n<ul><li>64-bit Processor: Intel Core i7 or equivalent\r\n</li><li>Memory: 12 GB RAM\r\n</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti</li><li>Storage: 3.2 GB available space</li></ul>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\nMacOS Users:\r\n\r\n<p>If you can't run the game, you might need to change permissions.
