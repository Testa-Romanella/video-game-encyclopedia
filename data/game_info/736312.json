The majority of the world is uninhabitable now and raiders roam the lands looking to steal everything they can from anyone passing by. There is one last habitable oasis, but getting there won\u2019t be easy as it\u2019s well guarded \u2013 you\u2019ll need to bribe your way past guards and sneak past raiders as you attempt to get you and your brother to safety.<br/><br/>It takes around 30 minutes to play through Cold Sun and it really impresses with its high quality artwork, exceptional environmental detail and heartfelt narrative. The stealth mechanics are particularly well implemented \u2013 offering a nice amount of challenge, but also being forgiving enough to allow you to recover from mistakes. A beautifully crafted little stealth adventure with a lot of heart.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b576e51779f82106e54ccf54769e72e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Student Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
