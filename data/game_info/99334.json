All you need is a keyboard, sunglasses, trail mix, LSD, keyboard, map, bird guide, etc.<br/><br/>Your goal is to zen out till the end of the track without missing a beat, while making sure to listen and watch the plants as they communicate to you. Inspired by hiking with friends that suck at nature, don't feed the squirrels. <br/>Because there aren't any. </p><p>Maybe you played it at Fantastic Arcade! It had a wicked moss controller.<br/><br/></p><p>All proceeds go towards making new levels.</p><p>Game by Paloma Dawkins (PALGAL)<br/>Programming and shader FX by Cale Bradbury<br/>Music by Caila Thompson (Mozart Sister)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d08/d08a4bc64eebccbc9cdc8a66494ca890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PALGAL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
