There's three main levels where you ride on creatures, and one mysterious bonus level to play\u00a0if you can score 5k points in the other three stages. I used Fungus Tools for Unity to do the text boxes and final cut-scene, and I re-used scripts from other projects to spawn moving objects and allow for setting keybinds. Other than that I made all the art &amp; scripts new for this jam.</p>\n<p>Default directional keys are WASD, you can change them in the options menu if you prefer something else.</p>\n<p>You can download this game to play it on your PC (just extract the zip and click the alien, delete it when you're done, there's no install!) or play it in the browser.</p><p><em>Credits to the music sources used:<br/></em>\"Time to go to space now !!\" by Komiko<br/>\"My Little Victory\"\u00a0by Voodoo Puppets, edited to loop the opening instrumental</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aac757404c673a94043726a7ce31bed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["utzsar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
