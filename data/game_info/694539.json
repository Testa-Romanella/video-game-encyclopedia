You will need to dispel the magic holding you in place.\u00a0To do this, you will need to counter the existing runes from the trap with runes of your own.</p><p>Every rune consists of a color and a symbol. You must counter both for all 3 runes of the trap to escape.</p><p>Press space to open your Rune Book and\u00a0see which symbols and colors counter each other. Press space again to close.</p><p>Dev Notes:</p><p>I had never tried making a game in 3 hours before, and my original idea was way too ambitious for the time I\u00a0needed to get it done in. I ended up having to cut about 2/3 of the planned content (and there are bugs galore), but it's at least playable and I am proud of that.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Dungeon Tiles - https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-tileset-4</p>\n<p>Wood Box - https://opengameart.org/content/wooden-box-2d</p>\n<p>Wizard - https://opengameart.org/content/crazy-wizard\r\n</p><p>Additional\u00a0Art Assets by Kenney -\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets</p><p>I ran out of\u00a0time to add music or sound effects, but I would have liked to use this:</p><p>https://opengameart.org/content/mage-theme</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/71800c1e4750f2c363862f020e1835de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["agentsmith200"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
