Portal Run is an endless runner where the player is placed within a surrealistic neon environment and experiences this contrasting world in first person as they run through the level listening to adrenaline-pumping music as they try to avoid deadly obstacles as they fly towards you. Luckily there is Curo, the playable character whose abilities help the player to overcome the obstacles. The player must utilize Curo\u2019s two abilities in combination with the player\u2019s quick thinking and twitch skills to avoid the rapidly approaching obstacles. Curo can shoot out two ability projectiles \u2013 portal projectiles and damaging projectiles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/76364ec412051dac0f8ebf9164e5b4c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sherilynne Herb"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
