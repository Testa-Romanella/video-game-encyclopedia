Your job is to survive the upcoming attack from many\u00a0waves that will bring various enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not every enemy is bad for the circle.\u00a0Green and blue enemies are beneficial for you as they regenerate your health and your mana! The rest will damage your health or your mana overtime.</p>\n<p>Shoot with left click and try to survive till the end! It might be slow at the beginning but there are way more enemies later on.</p>\n<p>There are no health potions or mana potions so use strategy to ensure that your circle regenerates those for you or you will be unable to survive!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and hope you like the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee593187ff956e3cd6e865920ecd6d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anski"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
