The goal of the game is to increase the primary currency of \u2018ratings\u2019 in order to upgrade and manage your many different generators.\u00a0</p><p>One begins with typical fares such as a cartoon series and sitcoms and eventually reaching a point where company acquisitions and liquid entertainment is the norm. The tagline of the game is: <strong>\u201cCreate and manage your own television network. Become a global empire! Take over the entertainment industry. And maybe the world\u2026\u201d.</strong></p><p>\u00a0I want this game to be a satirical take on the power and impact that these large multimedia companies can hold over the general public, as well as comment on the hardships that people working in this industry (namely child actors) endure. I got the idea for the game after binge-watching the Nickelodeon show Victorious on Netflix and subsequently watching some youtube videos about infamous TV producer Dan Schneider and his strange practices while working at Nickelodeon.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:51:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b041b9cc40357a75a48a6e627d466453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isiah Rosa - SweetBabyZay's"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
