The player creates blocks that their character can jump on to complete the levels. Because the theme was \"Unstable,\" the blocks you create disappear after the character touches them. I made everything in this game myself except for a few open source fonts. I hope you enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc1daac58533183baed77b1a2eeca8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sleepy Vampire Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
