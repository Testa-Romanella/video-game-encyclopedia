Getting both games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\u2019s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem.

You can be truly free.<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPERHOT<br/>\n<br/>\nBlurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPERHOT\u2019s features:<br/>\n\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>Endless Mode : how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n<li>Challenge Mode: take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n<li>Replay Editor: edit and upload your best runs for all to see on killterest.com.</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extras: delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nThirty months in the making.

A hail of slow-motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times.<br/>\nMaybe this time it will actually mean something.<br/>\n<br/>\nMCD\u2019s features<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third game in the SUPERHOT franchise - MIND CONTROL DELETE gives you more insight into the world of SUPERHOT, more story, more signature gameplay.
