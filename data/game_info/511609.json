Play through the endless gauntlet of microgames to prove what a party animal you are! How high can you score?</p>\n<p>There are three microgames (I know it doesn't sound like much, but the CHIP-8 is not exactly a beefy console). Two of them are played by pressing E. The other one uses WASD or the directional keys.\u00a0If you're on mobile, you can play by tapping and swiping respectively. If, by <em>some</em> weird chance, you're playing using a COSMAC VIP keypad (you know who you are), use 6 and 5789 respectively.</p>\n<p>This is a CHIP-8 game that uses the XO-CHIP and SuperChip extensions, created using Octo for Octojam 7.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:32:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7eaf5c4c386c8b325e74c390b81f1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cratmang"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
