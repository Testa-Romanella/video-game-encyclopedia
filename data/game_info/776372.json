As he wanders around lost, desperate for water, he is rescued by a strange princess who can transform into a dragon. <br/>Ichiro has no idea where he is, or how to get back home - and even if he did make it back, an almost certain death would await him. Yet, the loyal soldier is determined to return to Japan no matter what it takes, in order to fulfill a promise he made...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dragon Tribe<br/>Known by several names, such as Dragons, lizards, and Archgenians, this tribe is the oldest demi-human race in this world. They are said to live up to ten times longer than humans. Female dragons are born in humanoid forms, and as they age, some of them gain the ability to transform into a flying, fire-breathing wyvern... In rare cases, they can also spit lighting. The males of the tribe look like lizardmen - they cannot transform, but their powerful build allows them to excel as soldiers and warriors.<br/><br/>Dog Tribe<br/>Also known as Lulucarions, the dog tribe is a short-lived race that values strength. Thanks to their stamina, alertness, and agility, they excel at guerilla warfare in the mountains. However, they tend to not be very clever. Only the females are capable of shapeshifting between their dog forms and humanoid forms, while the males remain in a wolfman-like form at all times. <br/><br/>Cat Tribe<br/>Also known as Chaolia, the members of this tribe have keen minds and weak bodies, opposite of the dogs. Very curious, they just can't seem keep still, which explains their nomadic behavior. Some Chaolia are accomplished sorcerers, using a type of magic unique to their tribe.<br/><br/>Mermaid Tribe<br/>A race of only women, who can breathe underwater when they transform into their half-fish form. They sing a powerful song called the \"sacred chant,\" but they dislike fighting and war, and declare themselves pacifists. However, attacks from the other tribes have caused their number to dwindle to the edge of extinction.<br/><br/>Undead<br/>Also called zombies, Undead are born when a necromancer temporarily summons the soul back to a corpse. They can be controlled only when they are within the necromancer's range, otherwise they simply rampage wherever they please. In war they are used as disposable soldiers. Their performance varies wildly depending on the race they belonged to before dying, the freshness of the corpse, and each individual's abilities. In any case, their bodies are doomed to decompose if they are not maintained.<br/><br/>Dwarves<br/>Small creatures who live underground. They run the Miners' Guild, which is responsible for distributing metals and minerals to each country. Although dexterous and intelligent, they tend to be seen as a lower-class tribe because of their short-temper. They are very proud and inflexible, which can sometimes get them into trouble. <br/><br/>The Principality of Wisla<br/>The country of pure humans, who call themselves \"the new race.\" Although the country shares its origins with the Archgene Kingdom, Wisla considers demi-human tribes as inferior, and does not recognize their rights.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T05:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c2/0c296bb6a34da645064ba15ab783eb32.jpg", "website": "http://hatsumira.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 567, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frontwing"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Frontwing USA"], "esrb_rating": null}
