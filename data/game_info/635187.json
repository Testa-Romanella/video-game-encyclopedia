Fight off waves of fungal foes in this single player arcade game to see how long you can survive, upgrading your bird\u2019s stats and weapon as you go.<br/><br/>I've worked super hard on this but there's still a long way to go before this is a complete game. Please let me know of any bugs you find, and any feedback\u00a0is appreciated!<br/></p>\n<p>A Game by Jame</p>\n<p>Featuring sound effects by Ryan Jacobs</p>\n<p>A few notes:</p>\n<p>Since this is only a prototype, there isn't a lot of content, with only one map and 5 waves to play. Also, the menus are incomplete, specifically the settings do not currently save when you close the game.\u00a0Some, like resolution and fullscreen, may not display properly on launch, and others, like the Volume, Screen shake, and lofi settings have yet to be implemented, so bear with me on that. Even so, I think its in a good spot to call it a vertical slice of what this game will have to offer when it's finished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T10:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10d18e6b82fad0a06668084cd600ac4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chibi_jame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
