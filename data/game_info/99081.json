We hope you enjoy playing Ink Inc.!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game was made by:</p>\n<p>Anika Benons\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Andrea Gaeta \u00a0 \u00a0 http://rea-foxfire.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Eli Vazquez\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0http://superpokeunicorn.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Jack Virnich</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d73e2e766dc656809718e7cba3a4eb62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StanfordStudentGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
