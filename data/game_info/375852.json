As you can see it's very raw in terms of graphics, and the code is also very simple. My excuse is that I was aiming for a retro feel, like the early Atari games. Afterwards, instead of improving WvsOZ, I decided to keep it this way and start a sequel from scratch. It feels more like a heavy revamp than a sequel, really, and you can play it here. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf04d72514b543e86a54af629c8197c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ideabob's Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
