The probability is proportional to the number of Scrolls collected. The smoke bomb costs a certain number of scrolls depending on the difficulty level.<br/><br/>What would be a good USP for an action oriented runner?<br/><strong>Stop running</strong>! It allows you to break the rhythm, catch your breath and analyze the situation.<br/><br/>In my game:<br/><ul><li>If <strong>you lose</strong> it's always <strong>your fault</strong>, this is not always the case in runner games.<br/></li><li>You will need <strong>your intelligence</strong> as much as <strong>your reflexes</strong> with <strong>stamina</strong>.<br/></li><li>You won't die by chance, but you can survive by chance.</li></ul><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Use <strong>intelligence</strong> and <strong>reflexes</strong> with <strong>stamina</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>7 levels</strong> of <strong>intense</strong> and <strong>epic</strong> difficulty.<br/></li><li>More than <strong>55 achievements</strong>.<br/></li><li>At least <strong>4h</strong> to complete the game at <strong>100%</strong>.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T05:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c295645fdbfbd3afbf61071bb3f7c9.jpg", "website": "https://www.mars-touch-studio.com/ninja-scroller/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mars Touch Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mars Touch Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
