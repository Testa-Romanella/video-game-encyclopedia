Check the README file for a cheat code.<br/></p><p>Pacman's a pretty neat game, right guys? I started off with making a simple Pacman clone but I thought maybe I could inject my own ideas and design goals into it and create something brand new. So that's what I did. I got rid of all the things I didn't like and added a bunch of things I thought were cool that express my goals and demonstrate what I want to create when designing games: momentum based gameplay; AI that makes sense and properly communicates its goals; strong audio-visual feedback so the player always knows what's going on; shorter experiences that don't waste the player's time; etc. I gave it the subtitle \"A Sequel\" because good game sequels are always familiar to players returning from the previous installment while providing a completely new set of mechanics to play around with. Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8729a3e712b92c783691523c2d768e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jaunger1999"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
