The belt power meter is on the left along with the balloons popped count. You lose by missing a balloon or tipping over.\u00a0That's it.</p>\n\n<p>This game is about a cactus going on a conveyor belt to pop balloons, definitely makes sense. I probably put more effort into this game then I should have but whatever lol. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>druidic on freesound for clang effect - https://freesound.org/people/druidic/</p>\n<p>DigitalDominic on freesound for balloon pop effect - https://freesound.org/people/DigitalDominic/</p>\n\n<p>YouTube library for all the music.</p>\n\n<p>If you were wondering (you probably weren't), I had to build this game like 10 times to get it on the web.
