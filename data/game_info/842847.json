Since they eat rocks you need to use actual guns to remove the debris stuck between their teeth. Now now, we know that guns <strong><em>are not supposed to do that</em></strong> but what can we do? Using them for healing instead of violence <strong><em>makes total sense</em></strong> in this case. They won't make it easy though - they are very impatient and their massive size means you'll be operating under conditions similar to an earthquake.</p><p>Aim with mouse, left click to shoot. Your gun fires a burst of 3 shots. Remove as much debris as possible with your limited ammo to achieve a high score.<br/></p><p>PS : Bolded parts are the themes I went with for this submission to BYOG 2022.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c34078358e9b7f85fe434e3f576234b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xankill3r"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
