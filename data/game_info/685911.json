I am a 32-year-old Brazilian American trying her hand at creating a visual novel. The biggest inspiration for our game is Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn meets Seirei no Moribito (A mother-son anime.) The best part of making this game is writing it because I love getting lost in fantastic pseudo-medieval worlds and I hope you will too!</p>\n<p>Andrew Hendrickson aka Spud Dastardly (Portfolio)</p>\n<p>31, American<br/></p>\n<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>\r\nMy name is Andrew. I am a 31-year-old American mathematician who writes video game music for fun. This is my first video game project and I am very excited to have my music featured. <br/></p>\n<p>Kashi Oliver (Portfolio , FA)<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n26, Brazilian\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHi, my name is Kashi and I've been obsessed with art since I was seven years old. Every kind of art you can think of like music, movies, games, theater and, my favorite (of course) illustrations. My interest in art began at seven and I've been studying it more formally only after I was 20.\r\n</p>\n<p>Luciana aka Luha (Portfolio , Instagram)</p>\n<p>27, Brazilian<br/></p>\n<p>Hello, my name is Luciana or Luha, the nickname that I am most well known for on the interwebs. I'm 27 years old Brazilian and a freelance illustrator for the last three years. I've loved drawing since childhood watching cartoons on the TV and trying to recreate comic book characters I read while at the dentist. My love and appreciation for games is very important in my life for introducing me to wonderful, dazzling worlds I, as a rural gal, could never otherwise experience. Their fantastical settings, backdrops, moving music, and emotional stories inspired my little past \"me\" to chase after a chance to create a story one of those stories. Through my art, I want to bring it to life.</p>\n\n<p>Cover Art by TsuAkai8<br/></p>\n<p>Logos by Maris<br/></p>\n<p>Map by Dravidistan</p>\n<p>Photo Editing: Derek Jordan<br/></p>\n<p>Date Image: Starline<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Freesound.org<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:44:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/157dfa45779d6cbb7ec405f66b345ac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["noor-fernandez"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
