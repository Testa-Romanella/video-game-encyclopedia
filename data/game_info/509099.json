The more resources you have harvested, the more you increase your score. You have nearly 5 minutes to do the best score. At the end of the 5 minutes, a meteor will destroy the planet. Be careful, monsters can appear to destroy your trees and beings.<br/></p>\n<p>I made a short tutorial because the game isn't really easy to understand in the first place.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:32:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/845ae3a602360a0c463ab5ebbabdc5b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scratchinartist"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
