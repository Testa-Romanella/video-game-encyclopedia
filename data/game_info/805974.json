(Lost Relic)</p>\n<p>Connect TD is a tower defense game with connection in mind. You're incentivized to upgrade your towers and create the ultimate versions of each. By connecting 4 like-towers in a 2x2 area and fully upgrading them, you unlock their full potential. Some towers are more effective against certain baddies. Chains are also a method of connection in this game. The longer the chain of baddies you eliminate the larger reward you receive.<br/></p>\n<p>Can you reach wave 60? <br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>1-5 - Tower selection</p>\n<p>S - Sell</p>\n<p>U - Upgrade</p>\n<p>Mouse - Everything else<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T19:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e55/e5544feeccd8f5064315ca6d622f9c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unchiga"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
