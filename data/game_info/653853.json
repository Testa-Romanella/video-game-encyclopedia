It supports both 1-bit and 8-bit graphics.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>It's free to download and play!</strong></p>\n<p>This game features 10 unlockable characters, several scenarios, and a ton of fun sound effects! Can you score 100 points and become a master of Flappy Mac?</p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Click to Flap! Don't crash your\u00a0Mac!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>Smooth Sailing! - Flappy Mac Color\r\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nI crashed my Mac... - Flappy Mac Black &amp; White\r\n\r\nRecommended System Requirements:\r\n \r\n<p>Mini vMac or Mini vMac II variation (for color!) emulators.\u00a0Tested on System 6.0.8, 7.1 and 7.5.x. I recommend using System 7.5.5. I have included a bootable disk image for emulators.</p>\n<p>For a good time, set emulator speed to \u2018All out\u2019. (Hold Ctrl-S then press A)\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Check out my guide to preparing the Mini vMac emulator for games:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPFFrELdlg<br/><br/></strong></p>\r\nReal Hardware Requirements:\r\n<p>68020 or later. Ideally a Mac SE/30 or Quadra, but the LC or Mac II line of computers would be other good choices! It flies on my PPC Macs!</p>\n\r\nMinimum System Requirements:\r\n<p>8mhz 68000 w/ 1MB RAM running System 4 or later. (Plus, Classic, SE) Game runs at a reduced speed, but is still playable.<br/></p>\n<p>Sound doesn\u2019t work correctly in System 4, but the game will run. Use System 6 or 7.\r\n </p>\n<p>The sound is not compatible with some CPU upgrade cards.\r\n</p>\n<br/>Why did I make this?\r\n<p>This was a fun 2 week long project to learn about classic Macintosh programming. There's a lot that goes into the production of classic Macintosh apps, and I found it fun to learn how to put one together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I grew up with the Mac and it is sad to see how very non-existent the software support is for these oldest Mac\u00a0systems.\u00a0Most other retro computer platforms still get new games - now it's the Mac's turn!</p>\n\r\nGET THE GAME + SOURCE CODE<br/><br/><strong>LIMITED FLOPPY DISK RELEASE!</strong>\r\nI'm putting out a limited number of physical floppy disks that contain the game + the source code &amp; assets. You can see how I put this together with my fully (hilariously) commented source files!<br/><br/>\u00a0I'm doing these by hand and not a lot will be produced.\r\nGet it while you can:<br/>killgruz.com/flappymac\r\n<p>This game is not created or endorsed by Apple. It's just a free\u00a0fan game for old computers.\u00a0All featured\u00a0characters are properties of their respective owners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T09:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/66592e8f82adf7448c60c3dcf7216a97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gruz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
