In this reality, 2 million people were mysteriously transported to the Backrooms in the early 2020's.\u00a0 But that was 20 years ago. Now, there's a new mystery, new ways to exit The Maze. Will you get out of here alive, or is your exit, your death?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I added multiple endings to this game, more than two, so I encourage that you explore everything and try to talk to everyone. I've also put mazes inside of the maze, so REALLY REALLY explore EVERYTHING!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I've lost all hope of trying to get the music to work. Does anyone know how to fix that?</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T05:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44ad424e8ebadd0575e097c9b5302422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SwaGGyPP007"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
