The demo lets you view an apartment block by panning, zooming and rotating, as well as click on different apartments to view their details such as cost and features.</p>\n<p>All code is written by me, and I also made the 2D graphics for apartment features and button prompts. All other assets were provided to me by EnvisionVR as part of the test.</p>\n<p>Github repository link:\u00a0https://github.com/CptnFabulous/Marcus-Mouyat-s-EnvisionVR-Code-Test</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T12:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5e/e5ed20b696b889e5ab923b4bef9f552e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CptnFabulous"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
