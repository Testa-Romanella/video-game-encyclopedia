And they keep coming forever until you lose your three lives.\u00a0There are four minigames with three difficulties that it cycles through, and one boss minigame that appears every 15 minigame. The game speeds up every five minigames and turns into quite a challenge after a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong>The arrow keys</p>\n\n\n<p>I regret that I didn\u2019t have enough time to implement more minigames, but I feel like there is enough variety in there to last for a while if you\u2019re trying for a high score.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feel free to post your highest score in the comments!</strong></p>\n<p>My highest score is 116, try to beat that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c4338c7c21298956b17ff6b7fa15ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fatsheep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
