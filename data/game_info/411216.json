It draws from the game \"Eternal Home Floristry\", which was a lot of my inspiration, with more of a mechanic similar to VA-11 Hall-A, which I've never played but I've heard good things and it was sort of what I wanted to make. Unfortunately I had no artists on my side, and 2 weeks turned out to be not enough, so I don't believe it is as well executed as either of it's inspirations. <br/></p>\n<p>The theme for this game jam was \"Cold\" which is mostly background. If I had artists, it would probably be more heavily featured, but the general idea is that since it's a coffee shop, people are coming in to escape the cold.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with it and I begrudgingly learned a lot about Unity's UI system. A lot of hangups resulted in me doing most of the writing on the last day. \u00a0In part, this is good because I sort of did it all at once, but simultaneously it's bad because I'm exhausted of it and I don't want to fix the small things anymore and just publish it.\u00a0 This means there are probably small bugs I didn't notice, as well as typos and tiny things that are not ideal. Regardless, I'm happy with it, and I'm glad I have something to turn in, even if it's not as big as I originally scoped and it's more of a visual novel than something with gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>My final thoughts are as follows: narrative is complex and annoying to write on the final day, and the systems I built for dialogue and coffee making kept being rebuilt when I should have architectured them from the beginning to fit my needs. Obvious Things I knew before I started, but I put them here as a reminder to my future self.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65aa66a2d2c07ddca032db2639ce5a82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tseaver98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
