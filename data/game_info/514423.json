The darkness helps Mila hide from unwarranted zombie confrontations; however, it could also lead to her demise (given her limited vision). She carries her trusty shotgun and\u00a0lighter to help her survive, but\u00a0it comes at a price.\u00a0Her shotgun shoots quickly but\u00a0requires her to reload after every shot, which could slow her down in a zombie chase; and her lighter helps widen her field of view, but this also warns zombies of her location.</p>\n<p>Can she make it to her safe haven?</p>\n\n<p>--<br/></p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 The zombies will get stuck on the ledges sometimes.\u00a0The only way to move them is to get another zombie to push them off.<br/>- Avoid letting zombies run up to garbage bins.\u00a0They will be impossible to shoot and they can push the bin when you click on it.<br/>- For some reason, two zombies at the left-most bottom part of the map can literally yeet the garbage bins.\u00a0I don't know why.\u00a0I don't know how.
