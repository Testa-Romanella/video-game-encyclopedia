As described in a Pixar storytelling video, the director of Monsters Inc said that Sully\u00a0<em>wants</em> to be the best scarer but needs to be a fatherly figure to Boo. I\u00a0liked the idea of wanting to be the best at something, but needing to prioritize something much more meaningful such as a relationship. So, I started with giving my character the want of being the best superhero, but the need of being a good boyfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The want of being the best superhero is different from the need to be more attentive in a relationship because the later provides more meaning and happiness. Trying to be the best superhero is hard work and drains more energy from the character.</p>\n<p>The decision points and branches in my story address these motivations by showing that the character does want to help people (and cats) and will sacrifice a lot of time to do so, but also wants to spend time with his girlfriend because he loves her and she makes him happy.</p>\n<p>I came up with the story beats that made these decisions make sense by pulling from my own experience in a relationship where we want to spend more time together but other things get in the way.\u00a0 Pulling from my own experience hopefully made the story make more sense.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0worked to align the reader's interests with the characters motivations because if the reader is at all a hard worker, driven by passion, driven by wanting to help people, driven by wanting\u00a0 to give time to love but also other passions, then the reader would be able to connect with the story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea02d010db997fdf7a3be3e3c1ff3f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lilastudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
