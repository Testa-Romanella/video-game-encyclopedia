Get to hell, and you can mine a near limitless supply of Satanite and get rich! Each level has different ores to mine, enabling you to upgrade your gear in the elevator. Use your pick, gun, kicks, and suit to stock up on resources as you get closer and closer to the devil's domain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controls are stated in game, WASD to move, left click to attack.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m aware the upgrade UI is confusing, it was too late to change. Essentially, there are four upgrade types, and the symbols in their columns dictate how much the upgrade costs. Ammo costs one adamantite.<br/></p>\n<p>Hellivator is my second Ludum Dare entry and my first Compo ever! I'll probably touch it up and add more things before the 72 hour jam ends and resubmit if possible. The sound effects used in the project were not created by me, and as such I am opting out of Audio voting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/485af0b57f11e2d6444394eda0137c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Notic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
