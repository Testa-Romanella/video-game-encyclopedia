Try to remove all tiles from the playground. Colored tiles are falling down one by one in a round and you must place them how the same colors should be alongside. If you make a group of tiles [by at least 3 tiles] from same color then them will be removed. When you skip more than 1 or 2 rounds without making a group then a new line with tiles will appear of the bottom side of playground. <br/></p><p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/322441b7563ce1c015468b016f158df9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lee_kee_child"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
