All of a sudden you found yourself in Hell and you want to get out. The only way seems to lead through the 14 levels of Hell. Each level except for the first one is ruled by a boss holding the exit portal key. Since you are in Hell, the level bosses happen to be the Hell's most important fallen angels such as Lucifer, Mammon, Dantalion, Furcas, Zagan, Belphegor or Asmodeus. They are very strong, yet each of them possess a vulnerability you might want to discover.<br/><br/>Make your way out through all of the levels of randomly generated infernal dungeon, get the keys, food, weapons and other items from dead monsters, overcome bosses and escape that horror! Try to beat the high score in the global Hall of Fame.<br/><br/>This is a survival turn-based dungeon crawler game resembling the rogue-like classics from decades ago.<br/><br/><strong>Game controls</strong><br/><br/>Use arrow keys, WASD keys or a game controller to move your hero and attack nearby enemy creatures. Click locations to set spell cast target or to shoot arrows (with a bow equipped and some arrows in your backpack). You can equip armor items to your hero's body. The equipped items wear when used. The backpack weight does matter. It affects the stamina and health params significantly. Make sure you watch the health and stamina all the time, because with zero health your hero will die forever. When entering a new level (also the first level), some items are hidden by default. This is especially true for the level map and the exit portal. You need to find the red scroll to uncover the hidden properties of the level. Such a scroll is unique and it is in possession of a random opponent.<br/><br/><strong>Game features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Permadeath (if your character dies, the game is over)<br/></li><li>Turn-based gameplay with an intuitive interface<br/></li><li>Procedural level generation<br/></li><li>Limited inventory where the weight matters a lot<br/></li><li>Hidden items and traps<br/></li><li>You must hunt for food to survive<br/></li><li>More than a hundred of different creatures<br/></li><li>Enemies can steal your inventory items<br/></li><li>Attack and shooting accuracy based on weapon condition and luck<br/></li><li>Weapon wear and repair<br/></li><li>Stamina, mana and health recover by using potions, scrolls and food only<br/></li><li>Retro styling with a smooth camera movement<br/></li><li>No tutorials, no guides, no hand-holding<br/></li><li>Your global rank is shown throughout the game</li></ul><br/>Game progress is saved automatically and also manually - from the menu.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T05:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/0016235f8e88601ee88ddcae69238bc2.jpg", "website": "https://oshikuru.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Oshikuru.com"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oshikuru.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
