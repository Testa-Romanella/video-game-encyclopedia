In \"Era of Majesty\", you can manage people in order to build your own city. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main purpose of the game is to construct your own city where you not only build and develop, but also to protect you city because the world of \"Era of Majesty\" is not as friendly as it may seem at first glance. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour city can be besieged by vicious Orcs, infuriated Ants and Golems who come from the depths of the earth and even be terrorised by the terrifying Dragon who has decided to eat your people.

That is right \u2013 to become a Country. Build villages and other towns but do not forget about other countries which can help you to trade, make alliances or declare war! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you get tired of diplomacy or having conflicts with other countries, you can gather people in search of adventure! The world of \"Era of Majesty\" is filled with different creatures who want to, whenever possible, to destroy your Country; whether it is \u2018The Ancient\u2019, awakened from a deep slumber, or \u2018The Golem\u2019 created by a mad Magician. Both of them represent a huge threat to the world, but your people can fight back!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T09:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/52788d40932aae872efd77c1b1434034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 128, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evgeny Shcherbakov", "Alexandr Lavelin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atriagames"], "esrb_rating": null}
