{"id": 322361, "slug": "galatea", "name": "Galatea", "name_original": "Galatea", "description": "<p>A conversation with a work of art. &quot;47. Galatea. White Thasos marble. Non-commissioned work by the late Pygmalion of Cyprus. (The artist has since committed suicide.) Originally not an animate. The waking of this piece from its natural state remains unexplained.&quot; </p>\n<p>Galatea is my first released foray into interactive fiction. It is a single conversation with a single character, which can end any of a number of ways depending on the player&#39;s decisions. Despite its age, I continue to get strong reactions to it in my email inbox on a fairly regular basis. Some people love it; some people find it annoying or distressing. </p>\n<p>Galatea has what I call a multilinear plot: unlike traditional IF, it has no single path to victory. Instead there are a large number of endings, some more satisfactory than others, of which many could be considered &quot;win&quot; states. It takes only a few minutes of play to arrive at an ending, but considerably longer to find all of them. </p>\n<p>The game also takes an ambitious approach to NPC (non-player character) conversation, both in terms of volume (Galatea has many hundreds of things to say) and complexity (she keeps track of the state of conversation and reacts differently according to what has already been said and done).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/681/68195d5b9ea36f2721419fa2c1244e03.jpg", "website": "http://pr-if.org/play/galatea/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Emily Short"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
