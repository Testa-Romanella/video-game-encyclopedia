The other ghosts won't make it easy for you - these jack-o'-lanterns are full of ghosts, and they'll spit seeds at you to slow you down!</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move, Z to throw torches. Your score goes up by 1 for each lantern you light, and down by one for each time you get hit. If you're looking for a challenge, see how high a score you can get while also getting the two golden medals!\r\n</p>\n<p>Happy Halloween everyone! Putting this together has been a delight, I hope you enjoy it too!\r\n</p><p>Made in PICO-8, a fantasy console by Lexaloffle:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n<br/>\r\nArt: Soundole and Bookwyrmle\r\n<br/>\r\nEverything else: Soundole\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a07/a0752fb039a85a10e4b044e5a9d617db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Soundole"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
