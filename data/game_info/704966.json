The game Anam is for the older audience and all gamers to relax with a simple game that does not require much thinking and gives them the freedom to do as they please. The game has been developed for PC play.</p>\n<p>Wairua is home to the spirits, a vast range of immortal, supernatural entities that often embody different aspects of life and nature. In certain places, the landscape of Wairua seems to conform closely to areas of the human physical world, to the extent that a human might not immediately notice the difference. In other places, the geography of Wairua has no relation to the physical world, and the two settings vary considerably. Unlike the Human World, most of the Wairua's occupants usually go about their activities at night rather than during the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>AWSD to move</p>\n<p>Left CTRL to shoot magic</p>\n<p>ESC to open pause menu</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdfac4626a89c038153c6fa178caf6eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aoife_0302"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
