Our goal is to make addicting action arcade game inspired by likes of\u00a0Fruit Ninja, with a splash of rhythm games like osu!<br/><br/>Goal of the game is simple - keep the pancakes in the air! Easy enough, when you have to deal with just one slow pancake but don't get too comfy! More pancakes will be added and the pace gets quicker and quicker.<br/><br/>When you have finished trying our game, please give us feedback!
