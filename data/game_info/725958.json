Fortunately, you've got a Big Boot and all the necessary technique to send your little buddy to Paris with a swift kick up his rear end! But it'll take some practice, and he might need a little help with personal care in the meantime...<br/></p>\n<p>\"Punt Pal!\" is a Virtual Pet game smashed together with a classic Launch game from the earlier days of Flash. Each phase involves giving Linus food to provide bonuses to his stats, while being attentive of his needs, then kicking him into the next ZONE to level him up, increase his stats, and unlock new things to buy! Once you've beaten the game by making it to Paris, you can continue to play for a high score!</p>\n<p>Time for completion: approx. 30-60 minutes<br/></p>\n<p>(This game was made in 2.5 weeks by myself and Alejandro Cairols for the Team Dogpit Virtual Pet Jam.)</p>\n<p>CW: Alcohol (References to alcohol can be replaced with references to caffeine from the Settings menu.)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76fce6beee7e02071a1b908b02f99e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Will Bowerman", "Mr. Metal Alex"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
