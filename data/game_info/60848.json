{"id": 60848, "slug": "bonkies", "name": "Bonkies", "name_original": "Bonkies", "description": "<p>Bonkies is a game for 2-4 players where cooperation is the key to solving a variety of different physics based construction puzzles on sites all over the Solar System. To complete the challenges, you must communicate as a team, master your Bonkie&#39;s robot arm and jetpack and put the building blocks in the right spot before the timer runs out, simple, right? Great! Now get out there and help build the future of humanity!<br />\nBonkies supports keyboard controls for 1 player, but we strongly recommend using gamepads.<br />\nIt is the future and Earth isn&#39;t doing too good. The human race is getting desperate in the search for a way to colonize the Solar System. So far, human workers have proved too emotionally unstable to handle the isolation, and robots and their AI managed to render themselves useless through impressively efficient labor union negotiations.<br />\nWhile being bogged down paying out severance packages for trillions and trillions of nanorobots, the various space agencies joined forces in coming up with a new colonization program with three requirements- no humans, no robots, no money. After months of work they proudly announced their solution: Bonkies - Cybernetically enhanced astronaut monkeys, crash coursed in civil engineering.<br />\nThe promise of the Bonkie-program raised instant enthusiasm! Soon, people would be able to leave Earth and start fresh in on a new planet (or moon)! Soon, stores had sold out all their Bonkies themed t-shirts and plushies! Work started at once, monkeys were recruited from jungles and zoos all over the world, shipped off to training camps and prepared for the glorious task at hand! As we speak, Bonkies are being sent to various planets (and moons) in our Solar System, where they will await deployment. Humanity holds its breath!<br />\n2-4 local co-op multiplayer with a focus on cooperative and social gameplay<br />\nPhysics based construction puzzles<br />\nJet packs!<br />\nRobot arms controlled using state-of-the-art digital PID-controller technology<br />\nMonkey workwear made from highly affordable and easily replacable materials, available in 8 different colors!<br />\nGraphical user interfaces facilitating efficient space exploration and construction management</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-12T09:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa6db85fba60155a3909f46335a32053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Studio Gauntlet", "Gauntlet Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crunching Koalas", "Gauntlet Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
