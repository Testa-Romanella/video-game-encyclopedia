Search for over 200 items in photo realistic shops and houses on a virtual street. Will you be the one to find them all ?<br/><br/>Now with new higher resolution graphics for iPad and iPhone.<br/><br/>Pickers and Pawn Stars will love iHaggle's find and sell twist.<br/><br/>Unlike other hidden object games, in iHaggle Lite you actually move up and down a virtual street and tap to go inside the shops and houses, searching for treasures. Some are easy to find, and others are carefully hidden, making iHaggle Lite fun for beginners to advanced hidden object game players. <br/><br/>When you've found all the items on your list, head to the Appraisal Shop and sell them for the best price. Each level gets harder as the number of items to find increases. <br/><br/>For those seeking higher scores, you also have the option to play the Hi-Lo Challenge mini game in between each level if you want. <br/><br/>If you repeat a level, a new search list is created so you're searching for new items each time until all items have been used once. With 200 items, that's a lot of repeat play value ! <br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter :<br/>Twitter: http://twitter.com/motilemedia<br/><br/>Like us on Facebook :<br/>Facebook: http://facebook.com/motilemedia<br/><br/>And visit us online at:<br/>Motile Media Inc. <br/>Web: http://motilemedia.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16b50562b93d8ec445bf8a8cd81c170.jpg", "website": "http://motilemedia.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Motile Media"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["MotileMedia"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
