Word on the street is Ol\u2019 Lockpin Jones found something buried out in the woods. They haven\u2019t been seen outside their house in two weeks.

The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of everyday life alongside minor investigations and surprises, as well as\u00a0interactions and opportunities to get your imagination and creativity cooking.\r\n</p>\n<p>I was heavily inspired by a few crime stories and worlds that operate on the same plane of existence as the rest of us. Elmore Leonard's people always feel grimy enough to probably live two towns over from us.\u00a0 I'm always chewing over Ed Brubaker's work, especiaqlly his most recent RECKLESS books with Sean Phillips. I was also thinking about good dark Aussie crime like TWO HANDS and THE SQUARE and GETTIN' SQUARE. That idea of criminal people just sitting around the suburbs trying to think their way out of problems intrigues, delights, and kinda horrifies me.</p>\n<p>To play this game, you only need a d20, a d6, and the way and will to write out an awesome adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created using the\u00a0Second Guess System by Gamenomicon\u00a0- which is utterly brilliant in construction - and inspired by their\u00a0Hard Case\u00a0game - a brilliant single page of construction and genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like this, please check out my other single page solo journaling rpgs:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Welcome To Faraday\u00a0- a suburban horror story\r\n</li><li>The Seven Islands of Qoy\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0a mystical\u00a0kung fu tournament story\r\n</li><li>The Lighthouse at Kindred Rocks - an eerie coastal town mystery</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T23:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eed20c1d348c3f25ad0ceb7a5185c12a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanklindsay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
