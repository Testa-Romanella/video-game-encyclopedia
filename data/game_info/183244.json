The infamous witch trials are in full effect, and two witches, one old and wicked and one young and naive, are about to meet their end. However, the elder witch refuses to die peacefully. Using the last of her strength, she whispers a hellish incantation. Each word oozed from her mouth slowly fading into to cool evening air. In an instant the entire town began to quake and a powerful fire erupted from the earth. From the flames rose a giant demon who unleashed a blood-curdling howl that could be heard from miles away. The demon demanded to be obeyed by the younger witch, but she refuses. Because of this, she is thrown into a different realm. This is where the game begins. You fight through demons, level up your skills, and try to make it back to your realm.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e772de1eaec642dfe036ed0747a32d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["sauGameDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
