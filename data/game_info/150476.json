It's much smaller and more akin to my Halloween game and my first game A Short Journey as opposed to my most recent one.</p>\n<p>It's about a child who wakes up early on Christmas Day and the decisions you get to make as the child that decide if it'll be a good or bad Christmas. It's very short with only a few endings, but I tried to make it cute and pleasant so I hope y'all enjoy!</p>\n<p>Merry Christmas and/or Happy Holidays!</p><p>Oh and extra credit to my friend James who is also my first ever patron! Your brother in the game is named after this good sweet boy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/32852511d6c0cf06c45a6a558f59e85b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cameronhgamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
