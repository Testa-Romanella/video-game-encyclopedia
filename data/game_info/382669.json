I ran out of time for sound...so there are some super quiet, basic (probably annoying) sounds.\u00a0 <strong>The dragon sounds are a bit louder so don't turn up your volume.</strong>Mea culpa.</p>\n<p>2. Burning ground tiles creep up the\u00a0 bottom most wall at the start of the game<br/></p>\n<p>3. Occasionally loot will appear under walls<br/></p>\n<p>4. You can open loot containers through walls if within range<br/></p>\n<p>5. The dodge roll works, but it's unforgiving and there are no invulnerability frames at the end as you transition back to regular control</p>\n<p>6. Potions do not work. \u00a0I have not yet implemented a system for drinking potions from your inventory (you probably won't need them anyway)</p>\n<p>7. \u00a0The cursor is always visible. \u00a0This will be removed in the future when I have better aiming and menu systems in place.</p>\n<p>8.
