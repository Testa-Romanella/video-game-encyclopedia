All the robots and auxiliary machines have gone crazy and any object that approaches them will be considered as objective to eliminate.</p>\n<p>Your mission will be to destroy the six generators that power these machines at each base avoiding that they can overheat, explode and produce a chain reaction that could eliminate the Earth. Once finished your mission you will be able to return home.</p>\n<p>The enemies are indestructible, some of them may be paralyzed for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Keyboard:<br/>O - Left\u00a0\u00a0 /\u00a0\u00a0 P - Right\u00a0\u00a0 /\u00a0\u00a0 Q - Up\u00a0\u00a0 /\u00a0\u00a0 A - Down\u00a0\u00a0 Space - Shoot<br/>Kempston Joystick &amp; Sinclair Joystick</p>\n<p>For ZX SPECTRUM 48k and 128k.
