Non Ishida published three picture grid puzzles in 1988 in Japan under the name of \"Window Art Puzzles\". Subsequently in 1990, James Dalgety in the UK invented the name Nonograms after Non Ishida, and The Sunday Telegraph started publishing them on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>In japanese nonograms the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups. To solve Japanese nonogram, one needs to determine which squares will be filled and which will be empty.<br/>These nonograms are often black and white, describing a binary image, but they can also be colored. If colored, the number clues are also colored to indicate the color of the squares. In such crossword two differently colored numbers may have a space in between them. For example, a black four followed by a red two could mean four black boxes, some empty spaces, and two red boxes, or it could simply mean four black boxes followed immediately by two red ones.<br/>Hanjie has no theoretical limit on size, and is not restricted to square layouts.<br/><br/>Griddlers were implemented by 1995 on hand held electronic toys in Japan. They were released with name Picross - Picture Crossword.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T15:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/243cee462e05a1a86402b569530a14f2_xB9jtt0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Mobile Dynamix", "Dynamix Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dynamix Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
