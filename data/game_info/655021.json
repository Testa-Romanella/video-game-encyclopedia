Due to time dilation, time passes faster here than on Earth, thus communication from the colony to Earth is not feasible, as the message will not be received for several Earth years. The colony, therefore, has no communication or resources from Earth, and they are on their own. A generation has passed on the colony, while only months have passed on Earth. While the colony has survived so far, it is unstable, and a rescue mission, intended for the original colonists, intends to evacuate the planet. Will the colony become fully independent, or was it doomed from the beginning?</p>\n<p>There are 3 endings.</p>\n<p>Image from artbreeder<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb793cb6eb888632359f72cf1f4a7873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Axyss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
