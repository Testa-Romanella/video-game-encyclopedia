As you fall asleep in front of the TV, something strange happens. You are now trapped inside this strange dimension filled with villains and antiheroes from old movies. Equipped with your VHS gun, you must figure out what is going on and find your way out of this strange place.</p>\n<p>ExiTV is our first entry for the \u00a0second #LOWREZJAM. The goal is to make a game with the resolution of 64x64. We started out really late and tried to catch up with all the other awesome entries.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Derek Souza</strong> (@derekpxart) - Art, SFXR and Level Design</li><li><strong>Rafael Giordanno</strong> (@rafaelgiordanno) - Code, Sound Design and Level Design</li></ul>\n<p>All music composed by Rafael Giordanno.</p>\n<p>If you liked the game or found it to have some sort of potential, send us some feedback! We'd love to know what others think.</p>\n<p>All floating helmets are intended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49afff5312170b8c979a51b8f894d53c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafael Giordanno", "Derek.Souza"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
