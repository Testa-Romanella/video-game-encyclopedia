The only habitable part for humans is the surface. The world as we understand it no longer exists. Beneath these islands the only thing that can be seen at a great distance is a very thick layer of black coal clouds. In today's society nothing is remembered about the reason for this situation, it is more today that it is still believed that the world has always been this way, so many years have passed that the history of the world has already been forgotten.</p>\n<p>The world in which this story takes place is a totally different world from ours, or at least it is now. Specifically, we are located on a small floating island where our protagonist resides. We play Gyda, a girl who has been chosen to enter the depths of her island to investigate the tremors that are happening. The more our character goes into the caverns that have not been explored for years, he will discover details that explain how this new world was formed.</p>\n<p>During the raid, Gyda suffers a mishap due to the earthquakes that devastate the island, and falls off a cliff losing one of the weapons she carries. In the mine you will realize the state of the island inside and the reason for these tremors. You will discover an ancient temple hidden in the depths of the earth, which houses a mystery that will change your destiny.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>LMB - Positive\u00a0 Shot</p>\n<p>RMB - Negative Shot</p>\n<p>LMB (Pressed) - Charge Negative\u00a0Shot</p>\n<p>RMB\u00a0(Pressed) - Charge Positive Shot</p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - Movement</p>\n<p>Shift - Dash</p>\n<p>E - Take objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e677a379aa642a60e2047120cfc257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OverLord005", "Ignacio Game Dev", "Nerionde", "SergioEscuder"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
