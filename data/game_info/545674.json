Perhaps I should just let it go....\"\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>These were the last words you said before being brought into a mysterious forest. How did you get there? Are you hallucinating? All of this seems far too real, quick, find a way out! But it seems that there is someone or rather...Something that tries to guide you through the endless forest. Should you follow it?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You have nothing left to lose so how about following the mysterious sounds guiding you? The mysterious thing brought you to a rather old looking village. What is this place? Who brought you here?</p>\n\n<p>Discover the story of the lonely wooden puppet family by exploring the place. Who were these people and why does this village exist? Come and find out for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>But do not let <strong>Him</strong> catch you.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>This is a Bachelor project I did for my university.
