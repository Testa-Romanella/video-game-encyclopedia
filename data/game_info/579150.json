During World War III, the world had been forced to go underground into bunkers. Now, years later, an unknown\u00a0organization promotes Project Rebuild, and certain people are picked to explore the world. You are one of them.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In the world, your goal is to collect uranium. You can exchange it at the deposit for cash. Enter the vault and find a shop to go spend your cash at. Upgrade your pickaxe for faster mining speed, upgrade your backpack for more storage, (upgrading the axe does nothing, it is an unused mechanic.) There is the threat of radiation in the air, and you will need to watch out for it. If the RAD bar gets too high, you lose. Keep buying those shots!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - Move Around and Jump</p>\n<p>E - Inventory</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause Menu</p>\n<p>Space/Click/Enter - Use/Interact</p>Links<p>Discord Server</p><p>Youtube Channel<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa54bc4a86478cd08177e4cb1587a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["That_One_Nerd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
