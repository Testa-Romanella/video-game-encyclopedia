When you get in, you start to hear stuff. You then go and figure out what is making the noise.</p>\n<p>This turned out to not be much horror, but i had a limited timescale and not much experience making horror games. Still hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>This game is for a game jam. As you can see, its not the highest quality. I made this game while I had covid.</p>\n<p>-Coco</p>\n\n<p>PS: Srry Text is gitched.
