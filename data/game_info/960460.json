Players can enhance character attributes, obtain more powerful weapons, and complete challenge modes to gain better plugins to become stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFat Sheep Crisis has multiple maps. Different maps contain their own chaos factors that make the monsters more powerful and thorny, but at the same time, players will also gain higher experience and coin growth rate. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFat Sheep Crisis currently has five different skill elements. Contact between them can produce special reactions, such as increasing damage, auxiliary effects, or weakening enemies... Players need to explore by themselves to find out the skill match that suits them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlugins are one of the indispensable elements in the game. Reasonable use of them can make the game process more relaxing and pleasant.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T02:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4adc53034574e735cd0dd035f53de710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 365, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatSheepStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FatSheepStudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
