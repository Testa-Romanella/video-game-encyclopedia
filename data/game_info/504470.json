Behold the many loops of stuckness in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>The player is forever <em>stuck </em>moving in a\u00a0<em>loop</em> in the center of the screen!</li><li>There is a big spiderweb in the background. Spiderwebs are <em>sticky</em> and full of <em>loops</em><em>!</em></li><li>Though it looks like the player is moving toward the outside of the web, this is but <em><strong>an illusion!</strong></em> He is well and truly <em>stuck</em>.</li><li>The developer actually remembered to turn on <em>looping</em> for the music this time!</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made in 58 hours by Wesley, Trevor, Greg, and Brian Humphreys.
