Adventure through a world full of living dice, fighting creatures to protect other dice.\u00a0The catch is, your damage is entirely dependent on the roll of the dice (luckily these ones aren't alive).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I was only able to complete a battle system, so this is a bit more of a proof of concept than a game.
