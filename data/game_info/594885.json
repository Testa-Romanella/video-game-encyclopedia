Even though, let's review it.</p>\n<p>Your objective is only one:\u00a0Do you see this? Yeah! Its a bomb!\u00a0All you have to do is search these and pass near it. The activation is automatic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seems easy, right? Well, no.\u00a0You will have to dodge a lot of obstruction, hazards and enemies that will be waiting for you. They are rough and wild and might kill you if you get too close. Try to avoid them!</p>\n<p>Almost finished. Set your jetpack right. It will be your best ally down there. To control it, Press <strong>W</strong> or <strong>SPACE</strong> to activate the thruster. At least, but not less, you might find practical to rotate yourself with <strong>A </strong>and <strong>D</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>Another thing. Please, do not forget to exit that death hollow before all falls apart. You\u2019ll have a chronometer to make sure of that. We cannot afford another crew down.\r\n</p>\n<p>All say, buddy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>That the motherland spirit be with you.
