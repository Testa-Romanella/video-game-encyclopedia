It's tougher than iron and extremely rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the press of a button, you switch into another dimension, with it's own platform and traps.  Your job is to decide when to switch in order to avoid traps and land on platforms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* A Xbox 360 controller for PC or similar device is highly recommended.  While this game has been tested and confirmed to be possible with a keyboard, some might find it frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* To change controls or resolution, hold Shift when launching the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8c/f8cdf64d15dfa1b195f532213aac26ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 130}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Mulder"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Splat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
