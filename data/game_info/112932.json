Created for a How Have You Been game jam, i try to put my feelings into a game. I try to give life to the many different shades of being we all have inside of us. What completes me, and what leaves me incomplete. There is no light, without a dark. Every Blank page is waiting to be filled. Every person born is waiting to become something. Its how we interact with the world, what we take in, and how we handle it, that we fill the page that is our life.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy this experience, the game should only take about 11 minutes.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy it, please let me know. This universe is something i'd like to expand on and make bigger. This game is only a chunk, due to time limits of the Jam, but it was amazingly fun to make.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>THE FILE LABELED \"BLANK\" SHOULD NOW BE A SINGLE EXECUTABLE FILE</p>\n<p>NOTE: Mild Language, partial nudity, dark themes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185fdd76fd37343e455ad41256340be4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALLIE CAT GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
