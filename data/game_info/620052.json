We have discovered a bug where story fragments from a ghost who has just vanished cannot be removed from your inventory. Because of this, I would highly recommend removing all fragments from your inventory before giving a spirit their ticket just to be safe. This bug will be fixed as soon as the\u00a0GMTK 2021 game jam judging period is over.</em></p>\n<p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>\n<p>This game was created as a submission for the GMTK 2021 game jam! The theme for the jam\u00a0was \"Joined Together.\"</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- WASD or arrow keys to move. Shift while moving\u00a0lets you sprint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Talk to ghosts with the E key.
