Tensions resurface, and Nix's world begins to break down, his entire life jeopardized by the reintroduction of the most important relationship he has ever had.</p>\n<p>(Pretentious queer NaNoRenO kinetic novel with overwrought prose that I made as an exercise in fighting my perfectionism and actually finishing something even if it's unpolished. Hovering a lot on whether I think it is a good idea to post this but w/e, hope someone finds enjoyment in it. It's a bit over 10k words.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Content warnings: </strong>while this VN does not directly deal with these topics, there are references to sensitive family situations in the characters' backstories -- an addict mother and domestic abuse. They are not big enough to be considered spoilers, but be aware if you need a warning like this. If you come for romance you will probably also be a bit let down, the gay stuff is there but it's more uncomfortable than wholesome.<br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad8/ad8bfc319ecd03a074d41716209ab1b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nemomellow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
