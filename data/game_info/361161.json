The game is very short and like i said not much to do ... yet. Id love if you can give the game a try and share some feed back on things that you feel would\u00a0improve the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1579b1112a73de7e719701127ba50096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crosshair Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
