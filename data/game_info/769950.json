It's a simple game with simple rules : Kill as many skeletons as you can before they kill you! Swing your sword to deal damage and knock them back, the harder you hit them, the more they will be hurt! Use your left hand to shoot them with your magic attack, but be sure to charge it up enough to deal a good amount of damage and stun a distant enemy with it!\u00a0<br/><br/>To see a little peek behind the scenes, check this video :\u00a0</p>\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T08:51:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51ec6eed0f54f59a72cd06d8330e94b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Gamedev Cave"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
