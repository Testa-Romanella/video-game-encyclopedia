Gifted with powerful magic it is not rare that creatures aid humans in dangerous situations. But even these strong beings need rest and an elite group of people gathered to protect them in their time of slumber. From then on, the Rangers would watch over them. Then, when nobody suspected evil to happen, it struck. Malicious hunters and other vile folk rose and started capturing the peaceful creatures, wanting to exploit them for their selfish plans. Now it is your time, as part of the Rangers to free two captured beings from their tormentors and set them free again.
