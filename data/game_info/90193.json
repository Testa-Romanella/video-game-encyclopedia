Illusions become reality, and reality becomes nothing more than a vision.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHUMAN is a short psychological horror game which examines inherent, earthly, and otherworldly evils, and the forces which drive them. As you make your way through an Alaskan auroral research facility in search of employees it quickly becomes very clear that something has become alerted to your presence. Suspiciously, once it knows you're there, you're more than welcome to be there. Drawing you in, you soon begin to question all you see and hear.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHUMAN is highly metaphorical, yet accessible. All is explained in its simplest essence, but for those willing to look beyond the surface, there lies layer upon layer of symbolism, and clues regarding the nature of reality, which add depth to the meaning behind HUMAN.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHUMAN is primarily story and experience driven, however environmental puzzles and problem solving are interlaced within.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCONTROLS:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tW, A, S, D - Movement\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tRight Mouse Button - Zoom In/Out (Useful for reading tablet screens and papers)\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tF - Flashlight\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tE - Interact\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tShift - Run\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI am a one-man development team.
