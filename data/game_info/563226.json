{"id": 563226, "slug": "the-blob-conspiracy", "name": "The Blob Conspiracy", "name_original": "The Blob Conspiracy", "description": "<p>You are Joe Average who's been stalked by anonymous Forces for Years. Escape the dirty ol' Town, become an Agent of the HHS, infiltrate a\u00a0 fortified Facility and uncover the Truth about your Arch Enemy, to finally wipe him and his Castle\u00a0from the Face of the Earth for the Good of Humanity.</p>\n<p>Classic FPS with some Adventure aspects.\u00a0 This was the playable Reference Game of the CSP Game Engine V.10 in 2010. The Engine was developed from 2001 to 2010 and I post this here mainly for historical purposes. And because it's actually still playable. Sniper scope seems to be broken on todays Hardware, other than that it's working.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING Spoiler</strong></p>\n<p>In Level 1 find money, buy a gun from Joe, kill the soldiers and find the key to the train station.</p>\n<p>In level 2 stay alive and find the container on a train wagon. Go into it and press the red button.</p>\n<p>In level 3, first room, the key sticks under the table (crouch). Find and kill Baron de Geldgier, killed easily by C4 pack, then activate termonuclear warhead, then run to helicopter.<br/></p>\n<p>Cheats:</p>\n<p>_god, _ghost, _invisible, _cure, _allguns, _ammo, _cool<br/></p>\n<p>Note: the playable game is \"<strong>blob_conspiracy_csp10.zip</strong>\". The file \"<strong>game_kit_csp10.zip</strong>\" is the Level Editor with a very simple level example. The level editor is comparably user-unfriendly, compared to modern engine editors, so you probably better stick to Unity or whatever you prefer :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/651b88ef0a98c502c7418ad67e53cca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jfkEO1010etc"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
