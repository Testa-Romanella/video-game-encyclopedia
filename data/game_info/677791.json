{"id": 677791, "slug": "doll-vs-claws", "name": "Doll Vs Claws", "name_original": "Doll Vs Claws", "description": "<p>In this game, you play as a cat. You make\u00a0your way through a house, picking up items while also battling a doll who wants to pet you forever--and forever won't last long. Some of the items you pick up can be used in battle with the doll, but they are one-use items.</p>\n<p>Game Tips:</p>\n<p>If the doll runs out at you, be ready to fight.\u00a0Always carry at least one weapon.</p>\n<p>Some items are weapons, some items are tradable with other characters, and two items are 100% useless.</p>\n<p>Game Info:</p>\n<p>This game was made for the $105 Adventure Game Challenge. I was inspired by Clock Tower and the original Resident Evil 3 for PS1. Also, Maniac Mansion, and Spy Vs. Spy and Alf for Sega Master System. The last one mostly just because of all the exploring you could do. Also, the poster was inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.</p>\n<p>The following assets I made prior to the jam, as allowed in the rules: The doll's original sprite, the Egypt game's character and background, the theme song, the Egypt game's music, the Saber Video logo,\u00a0the\u00a0front door image(minus the lock), and the on-screen computer setup/colors in the study. These assets were made for other games, but only two ended up being in a released game (a larger version of the Saber Video logo and the computer's on-screen setup/colors were both used in\u00a0\"No Late Returns\").</p>\n<p>This game (\"Doll Vs Claws\")\u00a0was created during October 2 - October 9, 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T05:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/9325495d1f5c6d7ffcd72ab93fa77aca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
