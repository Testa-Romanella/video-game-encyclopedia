The main character in this 2D side-scroller, Brucie, was late for his first day of school! As you run through the game, Brucie must collide with the other children in order to stay young! Otherwise, as time goes on, Brucie will age and end up moving much, much slower. Collide and run over the other kids, and Brucie will stay young and chipper - with young legs to get him to school on time!</p><p>Made at OCADU | 2010</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a537b53d853d736217ef4c077201a48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boberfeld"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
