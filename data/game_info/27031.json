{"id": 27031, "slug": "art-style-digidrive", "name": "Art Style: DIGIDRIVE", "name_original": "Art Style: DIGIDRIVE", "description": "<p>It&#39;s traffic control with a twist as you try to direct identical cars down the same road in Art Style\u2122: DIGIDRIVE\u2122. This constantly moving puzzle game combines an easily understood playing field (an intersection) and a simple goal (create fuel), challenging you to properly guide a never-ending stream of cars. Stack similar cars five deep to create some fuel, then use that fuel to continue your progress in the game. Play in ENDLESS mode to see how long you can last, or compete against the computer or a human opponent in VS mode. Use combos to your advantage and see if your reflexes can handle the intensity of Overdrive mode. When all is said and done, you may never look at gridlock quite the same way again.</p>\n<p>Check out more Art Style games!</p>\n<p>For WiiWare:<br />\nArt Style: CUBELLO<br />\nArt Style: light trax<br />\nArt Style: ORBIENT<br />\nArt Style: ROTOHEX<br />\nArt Style: Rotozoa</p>\n<p>For DSiWare:<br />\nArt Style: AQUIA<br />\nArt Style: BOXLIFE<br />\nArt Style: BASE 10<br />\nArt Style: precipice<br />\nArt Style: Zengage<br />\nArt Style: PiCTOBiTS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T19:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01d89086babcb45b9b42aa1c33409646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Nintendo DSi"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
