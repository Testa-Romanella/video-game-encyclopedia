Scrumblo's adventure finally begins!</p>\n<p>This is a short project for a gamejam where the theme was \"only one enemy\". So I settled on an arcade type game where you lead one enemy that infinitely peruses you into spike traps to earn points.</p>\n<p>I can't do music or art so I used free music and little ms paint doodles for the art. I really just focused on a fun arcady gameplay loop and according to my playtesters, it's really fun. So try it out for fun gameplay if you like that.</p><p>Something special happens if you get 50 points</p>\n\n<p>Thumbnail is from @ooftroop on twitter</p>\n<p>Menu theme:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Main game theme:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f32/f32b1565b2f025067282f762fc7348dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squidnow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
