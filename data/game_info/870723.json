Within these walls are heinous experiments being carried out for the twisted minds that work there. Among those there is a peculiar scientist by the name of Dr.J. Frayman. Dr.Frayman is the lead researcher on the \u201ccrustacean revival project\u201d, however due to extreme oversights the subjects of the project have escaped and have begun making their way towards the outside world. Now Dr.Frayman must try and clean up his mess and prevent his experiment from destroying the world.</p>\n\n\n<p>Crab game two is a sequel to our teams first game (Pickle on Mars (with Crab)) however it is not necessary to play that game to enjoy this one. It is a hotline miami style shooter (lacking the polish of that game obviously) Shoot, run, and dodge your way through 10 levels all while battling strange mutated crabs and collecting bizarre upgrades along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Your health ticks down with time so you need to be sure to kill more  enemies to replenish that health. To exit to the next stage all enemies  in the level must be killed, after that you just need to make your way  to the elevator. \r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: W,A,S,D for movement Mouse for aiming Left Mouse to Start game and to shoot E,F,Q to open doors\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits Crispy: Lead Programmer \r\n</p>\n<p>Midas: Lead Artist, level designer, and backup programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Mardood: Backup artist, concept designer, and sfx/music guy\r\n</p>\n<p>Prangus: End screen artist\r\n</p>\n<p>HFM: Boss music designer (haydenmartin.bandcamp.com)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b131208e8c4e80e7e80a84e04bfa21e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mardood"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
