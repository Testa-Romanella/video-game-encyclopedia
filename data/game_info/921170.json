Also, avoid obstacles as hitting them removes a chunk of your water reserves in one fell swoop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When one of your roots touches a water pool it will slowly zap away at the reserve, the speed of the draining is corilated with how many roots touch the water source.</p>\n<p>So by only using a few roots you can halt the errosion of your health, while using a lot of roots you can replenish your water resevers quickly, allowing you to heal after taking damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your tree will grow and split into more roots automatically when you collect enought water. This will consume a bit of your water and create more roots to control.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T20:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54329f2cc3b318e8f4b2182d56d4c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MediocerPlay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
