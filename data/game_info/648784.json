Current features and contents are just a fraction of the planned game.\u00a0 \u00a0Expect lack of optimization and bugs.</p>\n<p>Today's game is just a big empty shell. Players can explore 6 clusters containing 35 star systems and land at 70 locations, but the <strong>actual locations are just placeholders</strong>. In the future, each location will be unique and populated with unique NPCs.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sorry, there are no weapons in the current version, and no friendly or hostile ships. Guns, missiles, explosions, and hordes of easy-to-kill enemies are planned.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sorry, there is no external view yet.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The current version of the game<strong> only supports game controllers</strong>. Keyboard and mouse is planned for the next major release, HOTAS support will have to wait, sorry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vision of the game.</strong> The game will be a combination of\u00a0 classic space games (Privateer, Freelancer\u2026) and classic adventure games (Space Quest, Monkey Island\u2026). The player will explore the galaxy by interacting with NPCs, locating objects, and completing missions. The game is focused on the story. Combat will be light, easy, and avoidable.<br/></p>\n<p>Instead of a big and complex story, the game will contain many short stories tied to NPCs and the game locations. For example, <em>\"why is Greenhaven no longer green?\".</em></p>\n<p>Expect insanity, irreverent dialogue, wacky characters, and wacky situations. This game is inspired by B movies, adventure games and humor books. From \u201cThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\u201d to \u201cPlan 9 from outer space\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Design decisions, that is, weird things that are weird on purpose.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Unrealistic flight model.</strong> Gameplay over realism.\u00a0 This game is not a realistic space simulator, it is just a game that uses space as a giant backdrop.</p>\n<p><strong>Unrealistic scale</strong>. Star systems are too small, planets are too big, and space stations and ships are completely out of scale. Yeah! It's true. But you can travel anywhere in less than a minute and the views are so much better. Gameplay over realism again.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>No jump gates</strong>. To travel to a different star, activate jump mode, select the star, and jump. And don't worry about having a gas giant on the way. Trust me you won't crash.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Compact locations</strong>. Locations will be small\u00a0 and fully explorable in minutes.\u00a0 Players will never get lost in massive stations.</p>\n<p><strong>Low-poly</strong>. Development is currently in the first iteration. Each asset in the game is provisional. Anyway, the plan is to keep the number of polygons as low as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The game starts on Nexus-7, a small station located in the Pax system.<strong> Find Bob to start the tutorial</strong>. After the tutorial, talk to Clarke to get your ship and begin to freely explore the universe of <strong>Scavengers of Planet X</strong>.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hints:\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>#1 Quick help.</strong> Press the select button on your controller.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>#2 Photo mode.</strong> Press down the left stick of your controller to take a photo.</p>\n<p><strong>#3</strong> You can use your <strong>controller as a mouse</strong> in menus and dialog boxes.
