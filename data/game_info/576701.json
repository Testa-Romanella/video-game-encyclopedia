Racing should feel competitive, with cars accelerating at straightaways and braking into turns.\r\n</li><li>Cars should behave a little randomly, so that different cars pass each other.\r\n</li><li>Demonstrate the AI behavior in 2 different sample scenes (one standard oval track and one track with multiple path options) built with temp assets https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tech Artists:<br/></strong>Jaclyn Ngo<br/>Avery Laux<br/>Ashley Liu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d8048bf1dfabfdd0fa86d6e9a69247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["NumeronNetwork", "Jaclyn Ngo", "Shaley104"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
