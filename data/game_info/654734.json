The old save was corrupted, so I had to remake a lot of features. Surprisingly, this helped me implement better mechanics and I feel that the game works a lot better overall now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is just a simple platformer. Use A and D to move, and W is to jump. Esc is to pause, which will bring up a small pause menu.\u00a0\u00a0There are 30 levels you must get through in order to beat the game. (Note: If you have played v_1, you will notice some level redesigns).</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T14:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/3588fcfff02ea7531af60ca7dbc128d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joshgibsongames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
