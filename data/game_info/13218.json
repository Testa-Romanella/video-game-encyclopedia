It was only his first day as the vice president of the Sunrider Academy student council when the unreasonable class president appointed him to be the school club manager. \u201cThese clubs cause nothing but trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m appointing you to take charge and fix them up by the end of the year!\u201d<br />\nAdd to that another completely unreasonable bet with his little sister that he\u2019ll get a girlfriend by the end of the year, and Kayto\u2019s school life already seems hectic! But that\u2019s not even the worst of it! Kayto soon learns that the captains of each of the clubs he\u2019s supposed to manage have serious issues of their own. Surrounded by girls lacking any common sense, his wacky days at Sunrider Academy begin!<br />\nYou will take control of Kayto as he carefully manages both his student life, and his responsibilities as club manager.<br />\nStudy hard, bring glory to Sunrider Academy, and get a girlfriend!<br />\nPiece of cake, right?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-31T21:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21b3461ba36309278e334e04809163bf.jpg", "website": "http://sunrider-vn.com/sunrideracademy/", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 483, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 389, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Love in Space"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
