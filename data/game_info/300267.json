With an alternative ship type, a unique difficulty option, and swift, racing-style controls, this game is perfect for replaying whenever you feel like.</p>\n<p>This game is a sort of follow-up to\u00a0Cell Driller, a game I made a couple years back for a jam focused around one-button games. Nano Driller was made due to my desire to experiment with what this unique control scheme would be like if it were adopted to a more palatable form. To supplement this, the game also features its own, quirky take on the usual lock-and-key exploration design, making the most out of the fairly small level structure. Give it a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d76ecc0178e59f4eb9f12a44f308d859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ultigonio"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
