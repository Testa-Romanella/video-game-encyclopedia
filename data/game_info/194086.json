Our challenge for this semester was to take a Classic Atari game, and revamp it into something new. For our inspiration we chose the classic game of Warlords, a player verses player battle for their kingdom! We took that mechanic, and made it into a co-op brick breaking experience, with enemies, puzzles, competitive battles, and even an overworld to explore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Kaitlin Black - Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Jared Gray - Programmer</p>\n<p>Rachel Lichter - Producer, Creative Director, UI Design</p>\n<p>Daniel Ramon - Artist\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1c33074dd7661f7b844efdd7f7a8239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rachachu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
