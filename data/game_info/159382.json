The game must fit into one single screen and offer challenge and a learning curve. Only use basic programming concepts (basic logic, no arrays/for loops) and your own art to build the game.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Game Features</strong></p>\n<p>- A link between narrative and player learning: you first encounter the god when he is asleep and get a feel for the gameplay before the timer and attacks starts</p>\n<p>- A multi-layered challenge including:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Visual targets </p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time management</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Movement and attack</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Object avoidance</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Resource replenishment. Phew!</p>\n<p>- Additional visual polish (\"fun touches\"): eyes moving to follow the player, enemy kneeling down when sufficiently hit, amusing bee animations, etc.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Making the Game<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I chose to base my game around Telepinu, an interesting (and angry) Hittite god. Hittite mythology is visually striking, rich in interesting characters, and fairly under-represented which felt like the right place to start (I mean, do you really want to see another badly drawn Zeus? Have a badly drawn Hittite god instead).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7e0ad0fdbba6d2f77925305bcd9610f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pauline Martyn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
