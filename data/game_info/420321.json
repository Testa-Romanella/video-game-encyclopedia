With no people to communicate with and no nearby civilization to fall back on, you are an Outcast. Soon, you discover the reason the island is abandoned and uninhabited: at night, animals that seem to appear out of nowhere deviate from their docile and minimally territorial ways to hunt you down. You, the Outcast, have only one option. The East shore of the island has a small dock with a boat in need of repair, perhaps left from the previous inhabitants of the island. Your goal is now to survive on this haunted island, collecting enough resources to repair the boat and escape!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to interact, harvest, and/or attack</li><li>Click on buttons in the top right to craft items or buildings</li><li>Click on bottom left button to unequip weapons</li></ul><p>Credits</p><ul><li>Game created in a Game\u00a0Design Class in California Polytechnic State University</li><li>Thanks to all the following for providing their cool assets:<ul><li>Island Asset</li><li>HQ Rock Pack Free</li><li>Create with Code | Challenge 1 - Plane Programming</li><li>Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack\u00a0</li><li>RPG Food &amp; Drinks Pack\u00a0</li><li>Meshtint Free Polygonal Metalon\u00a0</li><li>Low Poly Survival modular Kit VR and Mobile</li><li>Unity Create with Code Tutorials</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/515aea5845825276b0018596941a27a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["nightlore11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
