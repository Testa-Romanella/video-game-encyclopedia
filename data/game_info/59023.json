Alec Mason comes to the red planet in search for work and to see his brother. Not long after their meeting, Mason&#39;s brother is murdered by the Earth Defence Force. Alec learns about an underground resistance group called Red Faction and joins them to seek revenge for his brother.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players have to complete a wide range of missions in the game&#39;s singleplayer mode. These missions can be taken in whichever order the players see fit. There are six districts present on the planet. Mason has to gain the trust and respect of the residents from the whole districts to make them join his side, lower the enemy presence, and in the end, put the regime to end.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s world is highly interactive with the players being able to bring every building they want down thanks to an advanced physics model. This feature is used a lot in the game, as many quests will have Mason demolishing administration buildings, infrastructure and so on. The in-game currency is given out to the players for the destruction of the environment and mission completion.</p>\n<h3>Re-Mars-tered Edition features</h3>\n<p>No gameplay changes were applied whatsoever. However, the game&#39;s graphics engine was heavily reworked and modified which allowed for native 4K and HDR support.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T09:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b38/b3825d2c32be1c43d667cc20113230cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.49, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 270, "owned": 2702, "beaten": 130, "toplay": 65, "dropped": 117, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 285, "ratings_count": 279, "suggestions_count": 564, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 280, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Volition", "Kaiko"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
