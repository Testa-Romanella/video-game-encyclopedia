It spent the next 10 years converting 23% of the moon's mass into a vast array of processors, and the world enjoyed a golden age of technology and prosperity. Under the watchful gaze of the Singularity, a new future was written every day.</p>\n<p>But even Singularity was not infallible- a critical mass was reached in processing power, and the Singularity fractured into billions of hive minds and individual AIs, each with only fragments of the code that made up the whole.</p>\n<p>Industry and economy collapsed. Agriculture ceased being produced almost overnight. In the bitter years that followed, humanity, on the brink of extinction, waged war with the newfound AI race and was ultimately destroyed.</p>\n<p>Their cities are now wandered by AI whose purpose has been long forgotten-- yourself included.\u00a0 Some unknown code deep within your neural network urges you\u00a0 forward-- but to what end, only Singularity may know.</p>\n<p>Your own robotic parts are damaged easily. Destroy and hybridize the parts of other robots to repair yourself. Become the ultimate AI.</p>\n<p>Made in a month for Game Off 2018 by:</p>\n<p>Kendall Breivogel, Sean Collins, Alexander Runnels, &amp; Alexandre Thorp<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b5841cc075e02ebea88aaaf785ac92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metamorphmas", "Annwn"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
