{"id": 97897, "slug": "blitz-smash-deluxe", "name": "Blitz Smash Deluxe", "name_original": "Blitz Smash Deluxe", "description": "<p>You approach the large gates that open onto strange realms with your brother. Your brother looks at your Blitz Zero, living gun, and starts opening the gate. </p><p>\"I seek the Blitz Smash. It will make me a <em>legend</em>!\"</p><p>He smiles and walks through. You follow him into the blinding white lights, but when you emerge on the other side he's nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Now what. Find Solitude, your brother, or the ultimate weapon known as the Blitz Smash?</p>The Game<br/><p>\r\n\tBlitz Smash is a run and gun perma-death game built around the idea of setting up action paced gameplay. Enemies, weapon upgrades and items are placed into the level to create a balance between action and suspense. Your weapon fuses up to 3 different gun upgrades to make a multitude of different bullet options and play styles.</p><p>But don't take your time! This realm is unstable at best and after the timer ticks down, the level will start exploding behind you.</p><p>The game offers 3 endings, 2 of which will require players deciphering the lock on special chests.</p><p>A simple run ends with 1 boss at the end, whereas the complete will take you through all 5. So grab a friend, or play alone. Pick one of the 7 characters and strive to unlock the other 3 or see how well you work as a team and see how far you can go.</p>In Short<br/><p>\r\n\tThe game is designed to be for nights in with 1-4 mates with a dirty pizza and a few beers and just blitzing levels.</p>A Gift For a Brother<br/><p>\r\n\tThis game was a secret present for my brother. He's done a lot for me over the years and I want to bring him some sort of local co-op retro action that is different every time. The original version and gift to my brother can be found here: http://blitzsmash.itch.io/blitz-smash.</p>More Content Plan<br/><p>Every $100 spent on this game in total, the more content I'll add to it. The next chapter will be a bit of dungeon bashing with the Time Lord.</p><p>\r\n\tWebsite: http://www.2hitstudio.com/\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTwitter: https://twitter.com/2HitMatt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baa/baab5c7719cad20389f2b33eb54f0f1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2 Hit Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
