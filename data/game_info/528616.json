I thought it would be cool try making a Christmas-themed game, so here it is. Ola! Tannenbaum is a quick arcade game where you're going to need good timing, lightning reflexes, and absolutely no sense of colour-coordination to create the most chaotically decorated Christmas tree ever. Start by placing baubles, tinsel and fairy lights and top everything off with a star on top. Will you be a\u00a0<em>bauble boffin</em>\u00a0or a\u00a0<em>yuletide liability</em>?<br/></p>\n<p>Ola! Tannenbaum is an accurate simulation of what it is like to decorate a tree after too many glasses of sherry and with your eyes closed.</p>\n<p>I tried to make an in-game tutorial that explains everything reasonably well but here's what you need to do in more detail if you're planning on min-maxing this.</p>\n<ul><li>The closer you are to a target the more points you will get. Miss the target and you drop the decoration.</li><li>Baubles only need one target. Accurately place two in a row and you'll gain a bonus bauble that's worth double points.</li><li>Tinsel needs to be draped across two targets, one at a time. The longer and closer to horizontal it is, the more points you'll get.</li><li>Fairy lights are similar to tinsel but don't need to be placed horizontally.</li><li>Once all your decorations are gone or you have filled up the tree, you can place the star on top.</li></ul>\n<p>Top tips for a truly terrific tree:</p>\n<ul><li>If two targets are next to each other, place a bauble so one target will move somewhere else (hopefully further away so you can place a long piece of tinsel)</li><li>The longer you take to aim a decoration, the faster it will move, making it much harder to place accurately.</li><li>The star is worth the most points, don't drop it!</li><li>A well-placed decoration is worth double points, a well-placed bonus bauble is worth\u00a0<em>quadruple</em>\u00a0points.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T07:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d43a69ce54f388a47659a2902652b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Extar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
