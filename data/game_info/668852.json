It's good to tell probably that the game doesn't contain any kind of loading screens. and was tested only on private before this, so no your game hasn't crashed. It's just downloading the world. Physics also break if you have a bad computer, but give it a try!</p>\n<p>Starpier Classic was our first big project after a long time that we were seriously planning to release. We worked on it for ~7 months until Starpier Classic needed to be cancelled due to budget and planning problems at that time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Starpier was procedurally generated galaxy where you could do whatever you wanted. Story was also planned for it which would have told about the mysterious matter Negatium which were able to create wormholes and had negative gravity properties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or anything, we are still here to answer to them.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>Mouse: Camera\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>WASD: Movement\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Space: Jump\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>M: Starmap\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Esc: Pause menu\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Shift: Fast speed\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>C: Ship freecamera\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>F: Interact\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Tab: PDA\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>V: Camera mode\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>G: Landing\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Left Mouse: Break\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Space: Hyperspeed</em></p>\n<p>Hopefully you can atleast have some great time with it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:17:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d902a0adf0ef4db5ce69d5d63671d66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darkade"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
