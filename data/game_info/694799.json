Explore each corner of the spaceship to look for items that will help you get through tight spaces, climb up walls, or deflect enemy attacks. Defeat alien guards and pick up their weapons along the way that will make you stronger. When you think you're ready, find the door to the bridge, take out the captain, and fly back home to Earth!</p>\n<p>I made this game in my freshman year of high school as part of a project for my programming class. It's a pretty big milestone and something I'm very proud of, but don't expect too much polish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T05:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3e8f46018b2a9c9ee6acad3ad162b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Manning Unger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
