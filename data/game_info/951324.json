Why did she choose this path, and where will it take her?<br/>Aoi is a cheerful girl who sings sad songs.<br/>A rock star who finds loud noises scary.<br/>The child her parents always wanted, but never had time for.<br/>The little sister who made her brother run away.<br/>An idol whom all the staff love, but none of them trust.<br/>For two years, this is all Aoi has been\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>In the transitional period of this young lady\u2019s life, you\u2014as her Producer\u2014will be the only guiding light that believes in her dream.<br/>Or\u2026 maybe she\u2019ll be the one to guide you.</p>\n<strong>Cinematic</strong>\n<p>Less novel, more visual. Written and designed like a movie, this story is told through animation and sound instead of the usual narration, making for a light read.</p>\n<strong>Intimate</strong>\n<p>By utilizing different methods of presentation, diegetic exposition, and naturalistic dialogue, the events are communicated delicately so you may enjoy the plot without feeling talked down to.</p>\n<strong>Easy to Play</strong>\n<p>Play the whole story at once, or go at your own pace scene-by-scene. Don\u2019t wanna reach for the mouse? You can do everything via keyboard controls!</p>\n<strong>A Simple Beginning</strong>\n\n<p>No convoluted lore, no crazy drama. A child is trying to find herself, and that\u2019s all the complexity life needs.</p>\n<strong>Behind the Development</strong>\n<p>Developed in one month by one person, as part of the NaNoReno 2023 game jam.</p>\n<p>As an unofficial fan character based in the idol-filled Interlunium universe, Aoi is best described as \u201cthe most fictional character I\u2019ve made.\u201d<br/>As the only character I\u2019ve ever made that didn\u2019t originate from my own stories, I was always careful to work with her. The cage of canon made it hard to explore her backstory, and for a while, she had little more than a design and a couple tiny bits of fiction to her name.\r\n</p>\n<p>So how did this random fanfiction OC become the face of a game? How was she drawn, animated and voiced? All those questions and more are answered in the game\u2019s daily devlogs, which\u00a0you can read over here.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>\n<p>'Yoshioka' is built using the KiriKiri2 engine (\u5409\u91cc\u5409\u91cc2) and written in TJS2, using the KAG3 framework. Scripts are encoded in\u00a0Shift JIS, and as such, you may need to run the game with Japanese locale.</p>\n<p>Sprite animation is powered by e-mote.</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<p>Auto-mode at the highest speeds won't wait for voice playback to complete, but this should only affect a few lines, if any.</p>\n<p>The voice volume is tied to the sound effect slider. I didn't have time to make it a dedicated option.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, returning to the title screen during (and shortly after) camera pans may cause visual glitches on later pans. I couldn't find this bug in practice, but I never programmed in a solution for it, so... it might be there.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0'Yoshioka'\u00a0doesn't seem to be\u00a0natively compatible with Kirikiriroid2 emulation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T20:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bc46c37705211632b0f5c23838c7ebe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Takafumi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
