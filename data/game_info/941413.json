The tenant of the apartment isn't home, but unfortunately for you, some <em>thing</em> else is.<br/></p>\n<p>Explore the apartment looking for the items on the claim while avoiding a gruesome death. Complete a secret objective to unlock the true ending (3 gems).</p>\n\n\r\nThis game is eligible for my <strong><em>Free Key Program</em></strong>!\r\n\r\n<p>I  recently had an idea for a program where people can \"pay\" for my games  using alternate forms of value. In short, do something that helps me,  and you get a free key. I have more details in the application form. But  generally if you do a good critical review, let's play video, or  anything of that sort, I'm willing to give you a free key so you can do  that. If you are interested in this, submit an application here: https://forms.gle/Kbdpwn5xgnb6BuTx8\r\nI'm literally just one person though, so please remember to be patient. It might take me a few days to get back to you.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the Complementary Asset Pack, see this page.<br/></p>\n\n<p>See in-game credits for attributions.</p>\n<p>I'm feeling pretty good about this game, I'm getting the feel for making horror (to the point that I started seeing \"Teardrop\" in the shadows of my home at night.) So hopefully this one spooks ya!~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9330f3dbc905b357d86d1b5b05f0f973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["QueenOfSquiggles"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
