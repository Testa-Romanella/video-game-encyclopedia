Because the evil witch Samira has turned the creatures into sugar-sweet beings. Now strategically build towers on the playing fields to fend off the hordes.<br/><br/>You have the following towers at your disposal for defense: <strong>Archer Tower, Cannon Tower, Fire Tower, Ice Tower, Ballista and Poison Tower</strong>.
