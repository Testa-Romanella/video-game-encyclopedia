Shouldn't be too hard, right?</p>\n<p>You wake up in the middle of a vast forest, rain pelting on your frigid flesh, the heavy blows of wind piercing your ears that can only hear the desolation of the surrounding terrain. How long have you been knocked out? Does anyone know where you are? Do you know where you are?</p>\n<p>Upon sauntering around, peaking past the dancing trees and trembling bushes, tumultuous sirens are perceived from close by, impairing your ears. The static aches your head and the motivation to move to safety petrifies you. There is something nearby, and encountering it would be your fate.</p><p>Music by:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/@Tozaku</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd9226784c8a70f517b6649709413b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dikast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
