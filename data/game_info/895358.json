We are Bene \"Mitch\", Jonny \"Pixel\" and Robin \"Swaqtz\" and this is our little project \"Slip'n Fish\". Even tho there are multiple possibilities to interpretate \"It slips\" we thought the theme should be related to the time of the year. So we decided to create a winterwonder-slipping-game!  Playing the game is pretty easy: you are \"Pengu\" the little penguin and slide your way towards your home iglu, where a bucket of tasty fish is waiting!  Unfortunately there are some obstacles in your way, which you have to avoid by jumping over them. To do so simply press your <strong>\"Spacebar\"</strong> or the <strong>\"left mouse button\"</strong> and you will be there in no time! (You can also keep the button pressed to jump a little higher) If you should ever get stuck, you can abort the game by pressing <strong>\"Escape\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music, Sprites and Code are done by us three!</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Every run is randomly generated! Have fun! :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T13:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/458a0b6a238f734170cd762bb84e8421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ritomitch"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
