You can feel similar literary nature in some plots, as well as the unique narrative characteristics of video games.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T04:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a6668bd6ad55bd722147ecdbab2b166a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GouHong Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BD Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
