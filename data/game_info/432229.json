Only catch? Your power comes with a price, and it's money! Sell the equipment you receive to earn money, or hoard and unleash powerful attacks on your foes! You can even cash in on health potions if you feel like you're about to go under, but can you make it to the shop before running out of health, or will you have to put money down to make it there?!</p>\n<p>Developed by - Joshua R. Kerr</p>\n<p>Music - Free Licenced YouTube Audio Library Tracks, NOT Original</p>\n<p>Development Time: Like, eight hours, over four days.</p>\n<p>Why?: I wanted to finish a game, no matter how small or broken. This is only my first step towards getting to be a better developer after all, and I'm typing this out just as my time alloted reaches its end.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65b5eba1b39a34a113df23522bafbd00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blank Brothers Productions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
