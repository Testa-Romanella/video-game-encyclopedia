I hope you all enjoy the game and thank you from the bottom of my heart to anyone who purchases the game. But Please Bear In Mind its Extremely Early Access but I hope that with some support from the community and feedback on how to improve it, that it will evolve and get better! Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy Minimum Wage!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f8d65e30cb6079f12f40077192115f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrumpyMunkyIndy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
