When I heard that the theme was 'Out of Control' I thought back to NPCs and the struggle of keeping them alive and safe. So I decided to take this idea build the game around defending a NPC that is running around on their own.</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy this game! Please let me know if there are any issues and all feedback is welcomed!</p>\n<p>Mark</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b8/3b8edef6fcf0adcf4c8188308af825e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mooseman272"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
