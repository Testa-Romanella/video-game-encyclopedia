However, do not let the serene backgrounds and peaceful music fool you. This game was built with extreme challenge in mind. With 70 levels, very few of which can be passed on the first try, this game will be a challenge to even the most seasoned platform gamers.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>\n<p>The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. It has beautiful, clean and clear graphics, but can scale immensely to still be enjoyed on lower end systems. On release to Steam, it will include Achievements and Cloud Saving through the Steamworks API.</p>\n<p><strong>SOUNDTRACK</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The soundtrack is included for free with the purchase of the game! It is available in both .mp3 and .wav formats! These are the same tracks used in the game, so they sound good when either played once or looping. </p>\n<p><strong>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows Vista 64-bit</li><li>CPU: 2.4 Ghz</li><li>RAM: 2GB</li><li>GPU: DirectX 10 capable</li><li>VRAM: 512MB</li><li>HARD DRIVE: 1.03 GB</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows 7 or above 64-bit</li><li>CPU: Intel i5 3rd Gen or AMD Equivalent</li><li>RAM: 4GB</li><li>GPU: GTX 660 or Radeon 7870</li><li>VRAM: 2GB</li><li>HARD DRIVE: 1.03 GB</li></ul>\n<p><strong>VOTE NOW ON STEAM GREENLIGHT!</strong></p>\n<p>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597409929</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c6514b0e38fde2263a6a2ba3d9507ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhaleplaneStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
