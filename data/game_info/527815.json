The theme was surprise. The object of the game is to surprise Santa with gifts that you find around the island. You might be surprised by what you find.</p>\n\n<p>At it's heart this game is an exploration game and was not meant to be completely seen in one playthrough. There are\u00a0 23 different items to find, can you find them all? Also there are a few little quaint secrets about the gameplay to discover. Hope you have fun.</p>\n<p>This game was made with Unity. Special thanks to Polyperfect and their Low Poly Pack 4 as well as\u00a0 Kevin Iglesias for the run cycle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/1955a027002ae9c0a904abc3a96ef2f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mic1211"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
