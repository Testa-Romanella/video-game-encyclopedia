Tonight there are no distractions, just steaks to grill...</p>\n<p>This is a simple relaxing game idea that currently only has an endless mode. I may expand the project in the future and add more recipes / a better storyline!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All the code and art is done by me and the music is free. Thanks to Anto for listening to me on end about my 99 game ideas and for contributing to the design idea of the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abc7840fa636be00ff3128fbe16813bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dezilim"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
