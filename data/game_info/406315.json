Oryol birthed many children, and they lived happy lives. Those children had children of their own, and so now when you see a stranger who has a snake-like glint in their eyes, be careful around them. That stranger could be a descendant born from Oryol and Handyong, possessing either Oryol\u2019s hypnotic spell song or Handyong\u2019s superhuman strength. I caution you, dear listener, to be more aware of these demigod descendants. They can be capable of so much good or so much evil.</em></p>\n<p><em>Beware these snake-eyed children.</em></p>\n<p>A system-neutral game setting inspired by the folklore of the Philippines' Bicol region!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503d1eab7a0844994a3e5bc345395dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bougainvilleaz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
