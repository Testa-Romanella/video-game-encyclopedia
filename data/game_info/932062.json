I have also acquired skills in Unity such as creating, placing, and rotating objects, working with lighting and skyboxes, camera setup and adding a mini-map camera, working with sound, scripts, and textures. In my simulation, I have also included the ability to click on any planet and have the camera track its movement. Overall, my project showcases both my knowledge of the Solar System and my technical skills in working with the Unity game engine.<br/></p>\n<p>Planets:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mercury\r\n</li><li>Venus\r\n</li><li>Earth\r\n</li><li>Mars\r\n</li><li>Jupiter\r\n</li><li>Saturn\r\n</li><li>Uranus\r\n</li><li>Neptune\r\n</li><li>Pluto</li></ul>\n<p>Skills Acquired:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Learning the basics of Unity game engine\r\n</li><li>Creating, placing, and rotating objects\r\n</li><li>Working with lighting and skyboxes\r\n</li><li>Camera setup and adding a mini-map camera\r\n</li><li>Working with sound, scripts, and textures\r\n</li><li>Clickable planets with camera tracking</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T14:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/364d23d371c446b690befe7ceb2938b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SmartFrog"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
