You had to blend in with the inhabitants, so naturally you assumed a completely\u00a0normal human form, and a completely normal name to go with it: Norman H. Mann.\u00a0Nobody suspects a thing!</p>\n<p>There is just one problem though. Well, four, to be precise. You now have arms and legs and you have no idea how to use them.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>WASD to move, right click to hold on to\u00a0an object with your right hand, left click to grab with your left hand.
