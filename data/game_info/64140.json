Acquiring new equipment and upgrades opens up more explorable areas in all sorts of places. This adventure platformer takes you from the depth of a sunken underground city to the ruins in the sky all the way beyond the realms of reality.<br/><br/>The game has multiple endings and additional challenges if you're really good at treasure hunting. A normal playthrough will take about 4-5 hours, and with the optional content about 7 to 8 hours.<br/><br/>This version comes with Steam achievements and other minor updates.<br/><br/><br/>A few notes:<ul><li>If you want to go fullscreen without a visible window border, hit ALT+ENTER. That works in a lot of games! Do the same again for going back to windowed mode.<br/></li><li>The standard key setup is as follows: A/S/D + Arrow Keys - You can change these using the in-game key configurator if they're not to your liking. Gamepads will work if they're plugged in before the game is started.<br/></li><li>The inventory is opened while the third action button (D on the keyboard) is held down.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/798c077158dc27ae69086c5190aa4202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["origamihero games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["origamihero games"], "esrb_rating": null}
