I wanted to capture what it was like to feel like you were being eaten alive in a relationship. I shelved the project for four months and returned to it in July 2016, finishing the story and providing minimal edits.</p><p>The story is largely based on my own experiences, but with metaphors and symbolism. I hope you enjoy.</p><p>For Rachel, Marcos, and Sophia.
