Chain together combos for even more score in this fast paced breakout game.</p>\n<p><strong>Can be played with mouse, touch, or arrow keys.</strong></p>\n<p>Built using nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some audio and background images as well. Originally the background was animated. I had to turn that off because it nerfed performance of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f86d3e55508f4731d07f4acf4fabe45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kitjenson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
