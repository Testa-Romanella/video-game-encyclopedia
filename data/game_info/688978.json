Master the art of the unicycle and become a death defying ninja - or zombie - navigating neck breaking, flat surfaces, minor inclines and boxes, the size of paperback novels!<br/><br/>Did I hear seesaws, ramps and catapults? You'll get there in no time. Or maybe in a little time. Or even a little bit after that. Oh my, please don't hate us.<br/><br/>Enjoy 60 handcrafted levels, various characters to unlock and a game that is easy to pick up (depending on phone and hand size), yet hard to master and equally hard to put away. <br/><br/>Break a leg!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T05:31:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf22afcae5b616b30330b3a8de35d75_xYYWmL0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Roflcopter Ink"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Roflcopter Ink"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
