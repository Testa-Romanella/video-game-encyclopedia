The game takes place in Saint Christopher Hospital and follows Nurse Mary on her first shift as a late-night worker. Things seemingly start off normal but takes a sharp turn when the Doctor shows his true colors. Find clues and struggle to keep your sanity as you try to navigate through the six components of the Doctor's lair and end his reign of terror once and for all.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS - Movements\r\n</p>\n<p>MOUSE -\u00a0Object Interactions</p>\n<p><strong>Post-mortem:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Communication and teamwork were a strong suit within our group. We were able to communicate new ideas effectively and the level building was relatively easy. Especially condensing ideas into a full game concept on the design document. We believe that in the end, the game achieves what it was set out to do, despite a few changes from the initial design to the completed game, such as, room size, object layout, camera function, and controls. However, due to time constraints, we were not able to successfully stay on schedule.\u00a0Time was definitely the biggest stressor in completing the game. The main functions of the game are present, however, we did not have enough time to program the final dialog/story into the game. The hardest thing within programming was the sequential events. Everything being implemented had a very specific order in the endgame, each interaction relied on each other,\u00a0\u00a0if anything went wrong, the game wouldn't function properly.\u00a0Programming the minigames gave us a bit of trouble as well as figuring out how to program interactions and the AI. Overall, ideas wise we were a bit in over our heads but we made it work to produce a functioning game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:54:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/269ff19b4f3980da9b087cdc14a696d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jejohn51"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
