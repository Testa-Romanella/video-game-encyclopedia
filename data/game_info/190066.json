{"id": 190066, "slug": "textfps", "name": "TextFPS", "name_original": "TextFPS", "description": "<p>This parody of bad games for blind people was made for the Ludum Dare 41 jam.\u00a0It is a graphics-less first-person-shooter. It has two modes: text, and speech. In text mode, the direction and distance to your enemies is displayed. In speech mode, the direction and distance to your enemies is spoken to you by your system's text-to-speech engine (which the game assumes you have).</p>\n<p>Unlike the bad games it is parodying it's not all that difficult. In text mode, just move the mouse until the angle to your enemy is &lt; 15 degrees and fire. The trick to speech mode is to press space after you hear the angle so you get more frequent updates. Enemies move and spawn much more slowly in speech mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a0b50123b6030f3a2d4b3a37c101dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["p.bob"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
