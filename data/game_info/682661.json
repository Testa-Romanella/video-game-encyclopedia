It's a news game in which you play as the World War II-era Nazi-doctor, Dr. Klaus. The main premise is that you are a German spy named Franz Willers, working to assassinate the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler. It's a TV show where you must use your radio to find out what his secret plans are so you can get him. The individual episodes are done in a \"real\" fashion, with physics and physics-based puzzles, and the foundation is laid for a big story that is going to be told. This one's only 21 minutes long, so it's a good selection of fantastic narrative and gameplay, but I wouldn't recommend it for those who are tired of Hollywood action movies.<br/>\nThe first episode is now available to download from Outhouse Media's store.\n\nIf you liked this video you might also like\u2026\n\nStaying up to date with our video game news subscribe to our newsletter.
