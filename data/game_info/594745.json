But that will increase the weigth.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Weigth </strong>: all kind of parts you buy will increase the mass of submarine. You could make improvements in the hull in order to make it lighter.\u00a0 \u00a0The weigth will affect how fast the sub goes to deep, and you should give a look at the pressure.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Pressure </strong>: Each 10m down, will increase 1 atm. In order to go deep, you must make improvements at the sub.\u00a0Be careful, if you are at a higher pressure that you can handle, go up bufore the hull is completely damaged.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Water Tanks</strong>: You can control the level of submarine by fill/empty the water tanks - it consumes\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Energy</strong>.. In order to go deeper and faster, increase the water tank capacity - if your weigth bar is \"gray\" (read ligther) and you reach the max capacity, you would not be able to go down.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Engines </strong>: In order to move faster in horizontal way, you should consider buy more engines. That will consume more energy and also affects the Weigth.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Money </strong>: There are two ways of making money. First, by leveling up - you will gain a tiny amount of\u00a0 xp over time spent playing, but you could destroy the other \"non-colectable\" trash with your camera-gun (key F - front view of sub).</li><li>A faster way is to colect the trash found, then sell it at \"deeper market\", in the \"Inside-cam\" - inside view of sub.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note from Dev:\r\n</p>\n<p>\" 'Deeper Sea'\u00a0\u00a0is a game made during the Ludum Dare 48.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only thing I can say is that it was worth it. This is the third jam I have participated in - the second time at Ludum Dare, and this is what came out ...</p><p>I know this game could be pretty confusing, but i'm planning on \"clean\" the hud and make a tutorial soon.</p><p>I'm really glad to accomplish this chalenge and appreciate very much if you read all this.
