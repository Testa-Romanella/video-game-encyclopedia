It's confirmed to work on SteamVR headsets with Index controllers. You may need to set up bindings yourself on other controllers.</p>\n<p>I'll update the game as I develop more features and get closer to a full vertical slice of the game I'd like to make. The current version, v0.3.3, lets you test out the main gun that will be used in the full game, the Lever Action Axe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Axe has infinite ammo, and can be reloaded by spinning it like Arnold does in Terminator 2 (or like John\u00a0Wayne does in True Grit). Catching the gun as it's pointing in the same direction as your hand counts as a \"Perfect Reload\"; if you break\u00a0every melon while reloading perfectly after each shot, you get to high five M200.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: Please DO NOT reload a real-life lever action by spinning it.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T14:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e068a1cfec62b6beca9e44b6f3284c99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
