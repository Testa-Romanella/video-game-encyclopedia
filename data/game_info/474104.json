I had vague memories of it as a child but could never remmber it's name. A week or so ago, I stumbled across it on a retro site, and yes, there it was a game similar to the one I remember :)<br/></p>\n<p>The game concept was simple, you were a Sabotuer and you had to blow up an ammo dept whilst avoiding the guard. A randomly generated map would be used, you have limited bombs and had to cause as much damage as possible before the guard caught you or you caught yourself in your own explosion.</p>\n<p>The game also had an option to play the guard, I tried it but couldn't fathom the rules always ending on a minus score :/</p>\n<p>So I decided to re-write the Sabotuer part of the game, with some \"changes\" to make it my own.</p>\n<p>First thing I decided to do was remove the bomb limit, and have lives instead. Three seemed like a good number, a guard shooting you or you accidently getting caught in your own explosion would cost you one of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next change was the ability to move whilst explosions are going off. In\u00a0 my version you could \"in theory\" move to a safe area after the explosion wave has passed through. (It's not that easy to do). This brought another unforseen bonus, during the explosion wave, as ammo boxes are being destoryed guards that could not see you previously, might now. In which case you get shot :P</p>\n<p>Another change is the number of guards, original game, just 1.. My game it default is 4.</p>\n<p>Scoring is similar, 10pts a crate, 500pts for catching a guard in explosion.</p>\n<p>The differences between the versions means mine is a bit more \"arcady\" as you have unlimited bombs. The original was slower more delibrate as you had limited bombs so needed to place them to maximise score.</p>\n<p>Guards are armed with sniper rifles, always ensure there is a crate between you and them (4 directions only, up/down/left/right). It is possible to sneak past a guard in the open, it's not a bug.. Guards move on a grid and only shoot when they are fully in a square.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has a random (sometimes unfair) element, crates / guards that are destory are respawned after the explosion. It is possible to end up trapped or start in a \"no-win\" situation. Also if you die during an explosion you score no points for it.</p>\n<p>Controls<br/>---------</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move<br/>Space\u00a0 - Plant Bomb<br/>ESC - Quits\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bonus Options (Press 1 on Main Menu)<br/>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Nothing is really fixed in my version there is an options screen where you can alter the parameters of the game.. Want a tougher challenge, increase the number of guards.<br/>Press Q to add guards.<br/>Press A to remove guards.<br/>Press Z for the default values.</p>\n<p>Want to get cozy with the crates, increase the number of crates, or feeling the squeeze, reduce them :)..<br/>Press W to increase Crate Count<br/>Press S to decrease Crate Count<br/>Press C to set Default Value.</p>\n<p>Want to see bigger explosions? increase the explosion size, the default is the same as the zx-81 version 50..\u00a0<br/>Press E to increase the number of crates that blow up.<br/>Press D to reduce the number of crates that blow up.<br/>Press C to set the default value.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game :)</p>\n<p>Kev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:41:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e9522ab1a9c3e6ed38d2b8dd1b765e5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TsungUK"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
