Don't question it too much. Use A &amp; D or the left and right arrow keys to balance your rocket through the multiple bosses, then to infinity! Though the side borders may be a viable teleporter to get you out of a sticky situation, it isn't recommended for use often as it can severely mess up your balance. Use it at your own risk! Tip: If a boss is emitting particles underneath it, it is not wise to stay there.</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfae<strong> CONTROLS\u00a0</strong>\ud83c\udfae</p>\n<p>Simply use the \"A\" &amp; \"D\" keys on the keyboard to balance Billy's rocket! Alternatively, you can use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcdd<strong> NOTES </strong>\ud83d\udcdd</p>\n<p><strong>* You might have to wait a few seconds for the audio to kick in as Unity WebGL is doing its thing.
