Hopefully it's working, but if the server is down you can still play offline. The netcode isn't really well optimized so it can be a bit laggy, and I'm sure it's full of plenty of bugs. Still, it seems to at least work!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9feb92acb96e0a7e6e312b3a8f66da4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nisovin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
