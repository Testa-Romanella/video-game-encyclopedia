Enter a fantasy arena where you will face other contestants on your path to become the best elementalist.<br/></p>\n<p>The Elementalist VR is a multiplayer VR game where you will challenge other players in 1v1 duels. The spells are cast only by waving specific hand signs.\u00a0The duel takes place in a dark arena where you can teleport between several pillars. Each pillar can be transformed into one of 4 elements:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fire\u00a0</strong>- deadly but hurts you too</li><li><strong>Ice</strong> - fast but freezes you over time</li><li><strong>Storm</strong> - cancels other spells but might shock you</li><li><strong>Nature</strong> - healing but weak</li></ul>\n<p>What will be your strategy? Would your rather burn your enemy to ashes or snipe him from afar? Many other possibilities, choice is up to you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>You have 3 different levels you can play.\u00a0 Enter any of them by touching them with your hand/wand.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tutorial</strong></li></ul>\n<p>We highly recommend finishing this before going competitive. It walks you through all the basic mechanics the game has to offer.\u00a0You can leave any time by pressing the A Button on Oculus Rift/Quest or the Home Button on HTC Vive.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Practice</strong></li></ul>\n<p>In this level you can practice any spells on a dummy. There are also animations around you that summarise the hand gestures and spells effects. You can leave any time by pressing the A Button on Oculus Rift/Quest or the Home Button on HTC Vive.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Competitive</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Joins a room where you wait for another player. When you are both ready, the duel starts. The first one to loose 5 health points looses.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Notes</strong></p>\n<p>The game is in early development, so there are no leaderboards, you play for fun for now :-)</p>\n<p>There is no way to leave Competitive once you join the room (except shutting down the whole game).</p>\n<p>We are cross-platform! Play on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive (both Windows only) and Oculus Quest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b54477a58547fddda0dd2174f2b497.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["DES.X Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
