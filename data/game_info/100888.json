You probably shouldn't be. That usually means a lot of hurty things are\u00a0about to come flying at you. But it's kinda cool because it happens in sync with the music, right? I mean,\u00a0I think it's neato, but I'm just the guy who made the game, so I'm a little biased. But it's fun! And polished! People seem to enjoy it, which makes me happy inside.</p>\n<p>This is my first Real\u00a0Game\u2122 that I've spent a significant amount of time on (after &gt;6\u00a0years of only\u00a0unfinished projects and game jams), and I'm super proud of it! Please tell me what you think by leaving a comment or tweeting at me! I'm always open to constructive criticism.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy Vavio. I worked pretty hard on it, and it's kind of my baby.</p>\n<p>Oh, and you can go into the /Data/StreamingAssets/ folder and modify the text/audio files that dictate the spawning of enemies and their bullet patterns, if you like. I made sure to let those files be editable so people can screw around with them if they want :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83b41739c8b1ee2f9c4fb6ec759d7770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PeculiarCarrot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
