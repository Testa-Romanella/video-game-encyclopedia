There was darkness, but one light orb remained alive. It's mission is to reach the sun and bring back the light. You need to help this orb to complete the mission.</p>\n<p>I always wanted to participate in a <strong>Ludum Dare</strong> jam. Finally I had time to do so. I hope everyone likes this game. Obviously because of the time frame, this game is really simple in terms of gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>This is actually part of the compo event, so everything in this game was made by me including art, music and sound effects. Also the source code to the unity project is available here.</p>\n<p>Because we are still in this covid-19 situation, I wish the best for everyone here. Be strong and stay safe.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56a9def30e2d72ed9c8a12f961ea3406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Szivacs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
