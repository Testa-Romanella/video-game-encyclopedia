My idea\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0jam's theme\u00a0was\u00a0to create\u00a0that\u00a0experience\u00a0but\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0<strong>unstable </strong>time\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0tile\u00a0switches (as in the tile will change with a fixed but different timing).</p>\n<p>The story of <strong>Again</strong> is about a struggle that everyone experiences and how in the beginning it feels just like walking on thin ice. When you go through with it you learn it and the next time is much easier than the first, and so on. <br/></p>\n<p>The \"<strong>Unstable</strong>\" theme for me was about the feeling of unstableness and how it is mirrored in our minds, like walking on the ground that might soon perish.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Music by \u00a92021 Joshua McLean (https://joshua-mclean.itch.io) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</li><li>Soundbite \"Sound Effects - Finger snap with reverb\" by ShidenBeatsMusic</li><li>Character and sounds created by Sven (https://sventhole.itch.io/)</li><li>Clock sound created by knufds</li><li>Wind sound created by cobratronik</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T10:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c4/3c4bc79ffd7292ce30320465ad70d4b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dalajnikon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
