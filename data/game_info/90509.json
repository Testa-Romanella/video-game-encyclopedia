You play as Robin, a twelve-year-old girl who has an anxiety disorder and is very much alive in this hospital meant for beings that are not alive. Frankly, her anxiety was already bad enough <em>before </em>she landed in a hospital full of dead people, the still-shambling shells of ancient ghosts who try to take her down for a sweet taste of life, and the hospital directors hellbent on keeping her contained, and more importantly, away from the reason she's REALLY there.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, you have your new friends Jay and Sarcastic Ghost- Jay is a ghost about your age, and still a very new arrival to the hospital, and Sarcastic Ghost\u2026well, he's an amorphous blob of a ghost, who talks a lot despite not having a mouth.</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>Review from Waypoint\r\n</p>\n<p>Reccomendation from Rock Paper Shotgun</p>\n<p>Review from Nitro Rad</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>Lead Game, art, and story director: Lev Lefton</p>\n<p>Assistant Developers: Tredlocity, C / Ghoultreats</p>\n<p>Assistant writer: Rosemary Arnold</p>\n<p>Assistant concept artist: Maggie K.</p>\n<p>Music: Kendall Mcintosh, CMDonovann</p>\n<p>Other music: TeknoAXE, Sim Gretina, Aaron Spencer</p>\n<p>RPG Maker Resources: Yanfly, Victor, Freepik</p>\n<p>Special thanks: Rob Kvacek, zephror, Nitro Rad<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eaee3b9c2e9a68065dd76f6bc071e43f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SpitBlaze"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
