The three crew members you follow are: MC (the main character,\u00a0<strong>you</strong> basically), Nia (MC's close friend and sole engineer for the William Horizon.) and Doc (the medic of the William Horizon).\u00a0<br/><br/>This time they have been tasked with boarding the newly reappeared Horologium, a science vessel that disappeared into dead space without a trace 7 years ago. They are meant to rescue any survivors if any and if not have to discover what happened to them.\u00a0<br/><br/>What are they going to find? What caused the Horologium to just disappear? Is there going to be any of it's crew left? Or are they only going to find what remains?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls</strong>\u00a0</em><br/><br/>Esc = Quitting the game (I didn't make a main menu in time so it launches you straight into the game.)\u00a0<br/><br/>When choice buttons appear, use your left mouse button to choose which one.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The Dialogue moves a bit too fast sometimes, so if needed tap out of the window and dialogue will pause to read it. I will upload an updated file after the jam with a slower dialogue speed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Music</em></strong></p>\n<p>I wasn't able to make my own music for this as originally planned, but I recommend listening to this track while going through as it's what inspired a lot of it.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits/Thanks\u00a0</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Visual Novel System - Josh F\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art and Characters - Ashley J (myself)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Story/Concept - Ashley J (with the help of dear friend NJ)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Font Oswald - Free for Commercial Use from\u00a0\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0f2cd8c44b9c92670fe9cd9502b51e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadowaduro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
