I wrote the whole game code from scratch.<br/>I also added something that the PC version lacked - single player mode. Writing it was the biggest challenge of it all and most time consuming. In its current state it kinda works but is far from perfect. I plan to improve it in a later version.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Right Mouse Button - shows menu<br/>Left Mouse Button - selects piece<br/>cursor keys - move one tile in a desired direction<br/>Keys 1-8 - fire cannon<br/>Ctrl+cursor - building/removing walls<br/>Rules on how to play:<br/>https://web.archive.org/web/20020731141618/http://www.mwgames.com/cd_howto.htm<br/><br/>Review of the original:<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.vbgamer.com/review.asp?item=B48C58BC27D5A33C088D88E5C3EEE0AA&amp;page=1<br/></p>\n<p>The PC version cannot be downloaded from the creator's website anymore (it got redesigned and some things are missing) but in case someone wants to try it out, it can be downloaded from Web Archive:<br/></p>\n<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20020803202356/http://mwgames.com/cd.htm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df03944449c88cf074eead8a7970948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jcksbk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
