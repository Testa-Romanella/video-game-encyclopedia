Build defenses, train troops, and hold the line with powerful heroes in ValeGuard, a Defensive Strategy game.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Valeguard is a unique strategy game that combines Turn-Based City-Building with Real-Time Combat.  Each day you construct your defenses, train troops, and prepare for attack.  When enemies come in the night, you defend with towers, troops, and heroes with powerful abilities.
