The paintings were really cool.  I decided to bring a few of the paintings to life by jamming out little games based on his concepts (which were little more than a name and a pic of an arcade cabinet).  The first one I did was Hang In There, a game that was inspired by that cat poster that any '80s kid has etched into their memory.  I built Hang In There in 48 hours at the end of February, 2014.  It's about all of the stuff that distracted me from school when I was little.  Avoid all that stuff, study hard, and hang in there!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec8a7c6df3805b15303e6bfb62e24b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRealMattKain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
