The game isn't much, it is just a simple turn based battler, but at least I've finished it during the\u00a0Jam period, and that to me is an accomplishment by itself. :D</p>\n<p>The instructions are simple - just click on the opponent to do damage to them, use Q and E to switch skills. All damage is randomized (as per the theme of the Game Jam - Roll of the\u00a0Dice)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing.</p>\n<p>All of the artwork is made by me.</p>\n<p>The sound is made with ChipTone program, made by SFB games</p>\n<p>The music track (The Ancient Legend) taken from OpenGameArt.org, made by vitalezzz.\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/the-ancient-legend</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8450bbbed2b595174e497a33f6af83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brax89"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
