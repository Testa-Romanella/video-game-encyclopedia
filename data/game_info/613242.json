Don't look behind you.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is not much of a \"game\", meaning there isn't any real gameplay mechanics. This is intended to be a short atmospheric horror experience, that takes an updated approach to the story of SCP-087. <br/></p>\n<p>Lasts around 20 mins. This is not a 1:1 conversion of SCP-087, there are new events and lore added, as well as the layout of the stairwell being slightly different.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first ever published horror project, any feedback and criticisms will only make me a better horror dev in the future, feedback is appreciated.<br/></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>\n<p>Please enjoy.
