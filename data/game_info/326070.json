Only the 3-Player version has been \"completed\", so select Start P3 and the game initiates. Decide in advance who will be P1, P2 or P3.<br/>2. The players are taking turns in order. When it is your turn, your avatar has a countdown clock next to it and 3 tiles. You can swap a tile from your set with one in the big triangle by selecting one of both then click \"Swap\". Mind the clock or you'll skip your turn.<br/>3. After swapping tiles, the connected cities take damage. If your city takes damage twice, you're out.</p>\n<p>The game is over if there is only 1 player left, indicated by text (Winner!). If more than 1 players are out in the last turn, everybody will be declared as winner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e91ce44ac3e20c2e26fff696db815b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G\u00e1bor Urb\u00e1n"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
