This creature <strong>is extremely incompetent</strong> and will jump into danger for no reason. The only way you can control this behaviour is by <strong>picking it up</strong> to carry it around ,place it somewhere else or even throw it.</p>\n<em><p>Since you only have one pair of hands, you can not effectively damage your foes while carrying the noodle, so <strong>you are forced to quickly switch between punching enemies, putting the noodle as far away from enemies as possible and even using weapons.</strong>\r\nYou will encounter many aliens. Some will try to eat the macaroni, some will try to slice it in half, some will try to shoot missles from a far and some will even try to shoot it.</p></em><em>\n<p>Taking <strong>damage </strong>in this game <strong>can't kill you</strong>, you will just be <strong>stunned </strong>for a certain time while having to watch these deadly red creatures inch closer to your beloved piece of pastry. There are five waves in total. Though this is already challenging enough, theres also an endless mode for those looking for a bigger threat.</p>\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<em><em><p>Weapons like <strong>knifes </strong>and <strong>guns </strong>can give you a big advantage aswell, but since you can't look after mac, who is jumping all over the place, they are very risky to use aswell. You can <strong>throw knifes and guns</strong>, and while you're at it, <strong>throw </strong>them at enemies to kill them instantly</p></em></em>\n</em><p><em><em>Any and all <strong>feedback</strong>, <strong>criticism </strong>and <strong>encouragement </strong>would be greatly appreciated</em></em></p>\n<em><em>\n<p>NOTE: I have never eaten mac and cheese and this wasn't a mac and cheese themed beat and up from the start</p>\n</em></em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/9884a32a2f2f69d7ce9d888ea25f5df2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
