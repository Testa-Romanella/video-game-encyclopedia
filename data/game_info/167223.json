Hide behind the barriers for safety. use your shield wisely and remember to catch the double-shot and health drops.</p><p><strong>Flow of development:</strong></p><p>after completing the basics by following the videos, I created the extra socket to fire from on the player. I then proceeded to create the double-shot drop item, this posed some challenges as I struggled with some of the script. after some research I seemed to get the results that I wanted \" the double-shot activates for a set amount of time, coupled with a cool-down time the next double shot will be shorter if picked up less than ten seconds after the last.</p><p>Creating random scales and speeds for the asteroids was simple.</p><p>The life pickup was simple after succeeding with the double-shot.</p><p>The player feedback was also simple as it was very similar to the flashing orb in the previous project.</p><p>Creating multiple levels was simple, getting them to follow on each other however was not so simple.I succeeded in getting level 1 and 2 to follow on each other, but failed with the third level. After struggling for what seemed forever, I decided to make the levels accessible via the main menu as I could not succeed in getting them to follow on each other.</p><p>Creating the solid blocks was also very simple after doing all of the above.</p><p><strong>NB:</strong></p><p>I also added a few extras to make the game a bit more pleasing to the player:</p><ul><li>Sky boxes on all scenes</li><li>Background sound tracks on all Scenes except loading scenes</li><li>nice prefabs for the player, asteroids, pickups, projectiles and barrier boxes</li><li>I added a rotating space-rock to the main menu because I wanted to :-)</li></ul><p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p><p>Arrows to move</p><p>Spacebar to Shoot</p><p>E to Enable Shield</p><p>Green Pickups for Lives</p><p>Red Pickups for Double Shot</p><p>Esc to quit</p><p><strong>Production Time:</strong></p><p>Setup 5 minutes</p><p>Assets 2 hours</p><p>Player 1 hour</p><p>Enemy 1 hour</p><p>Menus 2 hours</p><p>GUI 30 minutes</p><p>Build 3 hours</p><p>Extras 2 hours</p><p>Fine tuning 2 hours</p><p>Review 10 minutes</p><p>TOTAL: +- 14 hours</p><p>I have completed all of the \"on your own assignments\".</p><ul><li>Extra Socket to Fire With</li></ul><ul><li>Add an extra socket to fire from for the player</li><li>Make sure it becomes a 'Double Shot'</li></ul><ul><li>Random Variables</li></ul><ul><li>Create a Random <strong>Speed </strong>for the Asteroids</li><li>Create a Random <strong>Scale </strong>for the Asteroids</li></ul><ul><li>Add a Pickup Item</li></ul><ul><li>Create a pickup item for the 'Double Shot'</li></ul><ul><li>Extra Credit</li></ul><ul><li>Pickup Item for Lives</li><li>Player Feedback (Player Flashes if Hit)</li><li>Levels \u2013 Create several 'New' levels with a different range of difficulty</li><li>Blocking Cubes \u2013 Create a solid block that Asteroids can hit against</li></ul><p>FINAL THOUGHTS:<br/></p><p>It was fun, cant wait to get started on the next project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a22ac5a5191bb31ee56247451ef180a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["furfur001"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
