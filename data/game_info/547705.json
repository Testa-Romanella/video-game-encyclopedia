You get weapon drops to keep yourself alive. How long can you last?</p>\n\n<p>You only start with a pistol and limited ammo. Zombies can drop ammo when you kill them. Near noon you have a chance of getting a supply drop, except for after the first night, when you are guaranteed to. Supply drops drop primary weapons, like ARs, snipers, and SMGs. Waves of zombies go up every night you survive.
