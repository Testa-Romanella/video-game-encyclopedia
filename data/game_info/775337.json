In this maze, the player acts as\u00a0Theseus, the king of Athens who is attempting to escape the\u00a0Labyrinth. The main difference between this and the standard type of labyrinth, beyond the fact that it is set on a\u00a0grid, is the fact that the maze is not empty, but also contains a\u00a0Minotaur\u00a0who hunts the player down, taking two steps for every one the player takes.<br/></p>\n<p>This type of maze was first published in 1990 in Robert Abbott's book\u00a0<em>Mad Mazes</em>.
