O'Sirus the Snip is a simple paper farmer driven to epic adventure by a spooky face with a spookier voice. He will ultimately seek to become a Knobbcrookian royal guard\u2013a Guffaloon. Stories of their heroic battles against the fearsome Bogold empire echo throughout the Crook. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not currently recruiting simple paper farmers. He\u2019s going to have to use every dirty trick in his book to cheat his way to the top and that means YOU will need to understand the key elements of the Knobbly Crook - Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Creatures of stone crush the metallic Knobbcrookians. The Knobbcrookians herd and farm paper animals. Fearsome stone giants fear tiny paper animals. <br/><br/>In the first chapter, The Horse You Sailed In On, O'Sirus finds himself on trial for all the crimes you have not yet committed. Retell his nonsensical story as his journey begins, finding himself a stowaway on a ship that is half horse, half boat, and half whale. Every moment that passes takes you further from your goal--the Knobbly Crook. It's up to you to torment the Drafthorse's unsuspecting crew in an attempt to alter their course. <br/><br/>The Knobbly Crook will be released in several chapters, all of them completely free.
