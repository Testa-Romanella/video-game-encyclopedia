It's nothing special - just Pong.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI built Paddler in my little game engine I've been building as a hobby, and it's proven to be a useful little test for it. All of the game logic is implemented through the engine's scripting environment, so feel free to hit Shift+Tab to open up the engine's editor and do some modding if that's your thing.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEnjoy! (As much as you can at least - it's just Pong.)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/6750d51082c5fbcec5e009e3614c85a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mackron"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
