It's a classic arcade platformer where the main character can shapeshift into 6 different animals. You can use your abilities to change into a powerful gorilla, a nimble cat, a diving fish, a gliding bat, a slidy lizard or a laser dragon(!)\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 35, and the theme was Shapeshift. We tried hard to base the whole game around the theme, and the shapeshifting is a key part of the design. We were really pleased with how the platforming feels and how the different abilities work together. One thing we failed on during the game jam was level design, if we decide to work more on this game then we know that we need to introduce the abilities one-by-one and build the levels around them. At the moment it's a bit hardcore, so sorry about that\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Keyboard \u2013 Arrow keys to move, up arrow or spacebar to jump. Z to dash attack. X to shoot. Arrows + C to dodge.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t Gamepad \u2013 Left stick to move, A to jump. X to dash attack. Y to shoot. Arrows + B to dodge.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe didn't have much time for level design, so some parts of this are very hard. Just remember that the dodge move where you turn into a cat makes you invincible for a few seconds, this can get you out of all sorts of trouble. There are quite a few crates around the level, and all of these have health in.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba7a95f5c8ea841423a81ef5d79c6a58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
