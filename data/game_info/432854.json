{"id": 432854, "slug": "botchers", "name": "Botchers", "name_original": "Botchers", "description": "<p>Botchers is an explosive local multiplayer action game for 2 to 4 players.</p>\n<p>Be quick and mischievous to survive your friends in arenas full of deadly traps.</p>\n<p>Play as a deadly (but cute!) gun-saber-equipped robot and use the environment to eliminate your opponents in fast-paced games.</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Botchers is currently in its\u00a0alpha state. There are known bugs and some features are still in development but it's already fully enjoyable.</p>\r\nWhat's planned ahead?\r\n<p>My current plan is to release the finished game late 2020. The full game will contain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 environments each with unique mechanics</li>\n<li>20+ levels</li>\n<li>Level editor</li>\n<li>Team deathmatch mode</li>\n</ul>\r\nWill it stay free?\r\n<p>For now the alpha will be patched until it's mostly bug free. Featurewise, the level editor and some environments will only be available in the commercial version.</p>\r\nI want to play online!\r\n<p>With the current situation there is good reason why your friends can't come and play at home. You can use Parsec to play remotely as if you were on the same machine.\r\nI have used it to playtest the game and it works like a charm.</p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>The goal is to score 7 kills in one game. Avoid traps. Avoid incoming dangers. Don't fall. Stay alive.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAction\r\n\t\t\tGamepad\r\n\t\t\tKeyboard\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tMovement\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tWASD or ARROWS\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDash\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSpace\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tShoot\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tL\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSlash\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tJ\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tGrab/Catch object\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tK\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThrow object\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHold  while grabbing\r\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\tUse  to aim\r\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\tRelease  to throw\r\n\t\t\tHold <strong>K</strong> while grabbing\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tPut object down\r\n\t\t\tTap  while grabbing object\r\n\t\t\tTap <strong>K</strong> while grabbing object", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f85a7ac097012cf323175622ee3e54f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gnomik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
