I finished in roughly 20 hours, so mission accomplished! As my  goal was to finish and move on, this will probably be the only version  (imperfect though it may be) of this game I upload unless some  game-breaking bug surfaces. Why this particular concept? I dunno, the  whole idea of the army sending tanks after a unicyclist struck me as  funny. Why black &amp; white? I just love good one bit art. Mine is not  what I'd call good, but I think it's charming at least.\r\n </p>\r\nCredit\r\n<ul><li>The explosion particle system is something I've been using since  @Krystman's  Breakout Hero tutorial and tweaking along the way depending how  complex/simple I need it to be. The particle code here is actually  really similar to the code used in the current shmup tutorial it turns  out, but it came from Breakout Hero originally and has lived in my  snippets folder ever since.\r\n</li><li>The opening song is my rough attempt at a simple translation of \"The  Entertainer\", a piano tune from 1902 by Scott Joplin. I think this song  is great at letting you know that what you're about to play is very  silly.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nHigh Score\r\n<p>My current high score is 43. I'd love to see how you all do. Thank you for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0a/a0a83cbac00ec74e2387fdc0c55d7f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2bitchuck"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
