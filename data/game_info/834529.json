This isn't a finished build! I am releasing this to the public so that I can put it on my portfolio, as I have college apps coming up. Sorry for releasing something that isn't anywhere near completion! You may encounter some bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Crows like shiny things, right? In Crowguelike, you collect shiny things and use them to vanquish your enemies!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Known bug -- If you notice that there is still an \"E\" above a trapdoor while it's closed, complete a room, and when it's open, walk over it before pressing E. This should fix the issue. I'll try and figure out what's up\u00a0 with that but it may be bit before I come back to this game.</p><p>Known bug #2 -- I think I just straight up forgot to create a death state or something sorry lol</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Art &amp; Programming: FartFish (Yours truly)</p>\n<p>Music: Lazernaut</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T13:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d556a76ac14ef2877b812a620f9140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["FartFish", "Lazernaut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
