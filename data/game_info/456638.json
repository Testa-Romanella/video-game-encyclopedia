You will begin as a tourist to Martial Arts, with no experience and slow reflexes. You will progressively move onto harder tiers of training, faster and more complex, until you no longer need to think but simply react.<br/><br/><br/>In Crazy Kung Fu you will fight against a wooden training dummy, using your hands as well as your body to punch, block and dodge the various spinning arms. Throughout your journey you will learn how to be a master at all of these, building muscle memory at first, to then rely on instinct and quick thinking.<br/><br/><br/>All your moves are tracked, you will have statistics on speed, accuracy, strength, all of which will help you assess your progress, target your weaknesses and push towards becoming a Kung Fu Master.<br/><br/><br/>There are a variety of extra modes to challenge yourself futher, from catching and eating shrimp while you fight, to dodging arrows from both sides. And for those who want to take their training a step further they can use the Infinite mode and training for as long as they can hold. <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T01:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7f23b95a68f4dbc6e2660a4d888ccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Field Of Vision"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Field Of Vision"], "esrb_rating": null}
