On your way to the top, you'll encounter polite monstrosities, killer machines, bee farmers and stuck-up immortals. You'll learn to control your powers and with the help of your gun become an unstoppable force for... well. Yourself. Because this is a game about selfishness.<br/></p>\n<p>Thorne is a story a decade in the making. This little demo is what you can expect from the full game, whenever that becomes a reality. It is a story-driven RPG divided into (so far) nine floors, each containing a small slice of Clara's journey to the top.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have a chance to play the game or would like to have early access to test versions, message me your feedback over on Instagram @thorne_dev or on Twitter @Thorne_Dev<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: Currently only a Windows version is available, but I'm working on a Mac version in the future!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f3021f7bfb14af095d239da5bbe4f32b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thorne_dev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
