Transformations happen, and not always by choice. In Runes of Pandemonium, many NPCs will react to you differently depending on what transformation you are currently using, with some being more appreciative of certain forms than others.<h3>THE FUTURE</h3><br/>Two chapters released and four to go, with the final chapter being longer than the first five combined.<br/><br/>We expect each chapter to take about a year to create, with each chapter being a full game on its own.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T04:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9ca94fbc5386b751988cfa9ebeaa08b.jpg", "website": "https://hopremastered.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bottled Starlight"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Bottled Starlight"], "esrb_rating": null}
