Challenge your friends to beat your best score! The higher the difficulty the higher your potential score.<br/><br/>Scores are calculated based on the amount of damage done to the boss, your remaining HP at the end of the fight and the amount of time it took to beat the boss. Higher difficulties give the boss more HP and therefore have a higher score potential when done flawlessly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T07:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf1637b0881a28455974cdcfda58ca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Filmorth"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
