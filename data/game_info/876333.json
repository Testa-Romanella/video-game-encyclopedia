The main objective of the game is to slot through the gaps between obstacle pipes to survive. If the bird hits a pipe, flies to the ground or flies up too high, the bird dies and the round ends.</p>\n<p>Players can perform certain tasks that give the bird powers, such as shooting down trees to activate pipe-destroying eggs. This game can be played in both first or third-person, depending on the player's preference: players can switch point-of-view before the game starts or while playing.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e8/1e86f6cf9550c150571804a663a6a7e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["davidle2904"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
