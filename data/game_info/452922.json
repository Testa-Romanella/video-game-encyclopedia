Until you showed up!</p>\n<p>Determined to prove that this barren wasteland can be lived in, you have tasked yourself with building the beginnings of a small town. Will you manage to secure your place as ruler of Frostholme, or will you succumb to it's chill?\r\n</p><p>A game for Weekly Game Jam #152 - Shelter</p>\r\n Controls \r\n<p> Use the <strong>WASD</strong> keys to move your character around.\r\n<br/> Use <strong> SHIFT</strong> to sprint.\r\n<br/> Use <strong>E </strong> to pick up items from the ground, or to attack rabbits.\r\n<br/> Use <strong>Z </strong>, <strong>X </strong> and <strong>C </strong>to navigate the building menu, and <strong>Q </strong>to build your selection.\r\nUse <strong>T </strong> to fall asleep and <strong>R </strong> to wake up again.\r\n</p> \r\n Gameplay \r\n<p> The objective of the game is to <strong>build 5 houses</strong>. A house is an area enclosed by walls that has floor on the inside, and a bed. It is also at least 2x2 tiles large. A house may only have one bed.\r\n<br/>\r\nWhilst playing the game, you need to keep an eye on both your <strong>temperature </strong>and your <strong>energy</strong>, which are both represented by the bars in the top right of the screen. \r\n</p>\r\n Energy \r\n<p> To gain energy, you need to sleep. The higher your temperature whilst sleeping, the faster you gain energy. If your energy falls too low, you will collapse and sleep until you are slightly more energised. \r\n<br/>\r\nEnergy is used up whenever you move.\r\n</p>\r\n Temperature \r\n<p> Your temperature will constantly decrease whenever you are outside. To gain temperature, you will need to build and stay close to fires. \r\n<br/>\r\nYou do not lose any temperature when indoors, but also do not gain temperature from nearby fires. The only way to gain temperature indoors is to sleep in a bed. \r\n<br/>\n<strong> If your temperature drops to 0, you will die. </strong>\n</p>\n\n\r\n Like what you see? \r\n<p> If you enjoyed Frostholme, or would like to encourage me to make other games, why not  buy me a coffee? </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf6ac8e7dfcd0cb23a43d452f966fab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Space Otter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
