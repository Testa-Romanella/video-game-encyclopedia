Zipline between vantage points surrounding the battle field and use heavy weapons to cover your teammate on longer and longer supply runs. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBasic rules:<br/>\r\n- Runner starts and ends at the train station<br/>\r\n- Runner has a certain amount of ammunition which refills for each run<br/>\r\n- Predict the runner's path and pave the way for him to return safely<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main game is about scavenging a series of maps, finding enough fuel &amp; weapons in each stage to progress to the next.<br/>\r\nYour runner finds supplies &amp; fuel in the boxes, which he hands over to you after each run.<br/>\r\nIf things get tight, call the runner back any time.<br/>\r\nGather XP with your shooting kills to unlock perma-boosts and make sure to pick up some helicopter drops.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first two maps can also be played in an endless practice scenario &amp; also feature 15 strategic levels, each with a unique solution path that requires more than just shooting. Levels have a fix setup of where survivors come in and where the zombies are and can only be resolved with strategic and well-timed use of the available weapons and tools.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328370e3b29b17b45e3aded70b3dc993.jpg", "website": "http://deadtrailz.galacticbits.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 53, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Galactic Bits"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Galactic Bits"], "esrb_rating": null}
