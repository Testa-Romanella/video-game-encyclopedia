First thank you for checking my game out! The Haunted Drive Home : Charlie's Horror\u00a0has a horror setting and is made up of pixel art 3D assets. For the most part it is an FPS but it has puzzle elements. I developed this game with my step daughter and some of the art and art direction is her work. I also used some art from art packs made by VexedEnigma/PixelJustice found here https://malibudarby.itch.io/. I\u00a0also use Audio from\u00a0https://jdbartist.itch.io/\u00a0and\u00a0https://joelsteudler.itch.io/. <br/></p>\n<p>It is a short game will take most people probably anywhere from 20 mins to an hour to complete. If you have any questions or issues from not installing to a bug you find please let me know and I will help/fix when I can. Thank you! And I hope you enjoy! Take care! P.S. this is a windows only\u00a0 game with mouse and keyboard controls. Will try and add gamepad support in the future. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aad234e664dd2a96d0bdc5b7de21624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DSA"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
