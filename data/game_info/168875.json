Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.</p><p>The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations.</p><p><strong>Product Features</strong></p><p>\u2022 rewind function;<br/> \u2022 stars based score (can you get them all?);<br/> \u2022 auto solve function (not available for all levels);<br/> \u2022 dozens of levels, with more to come.</p><p>\n<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts (PC)<br/>\n</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>R - retry</li>\n<li>L - show solution</li>\n<li>Backspace - rewind</li><li>Mouse Scroll - zoom (in or out)</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><ul><li>Programming\r\n<ul><li>Shin-NiL</li></ul></li><li>Sokoban graphics assets\r\n<ul><li>1001.com</li></ul></li><li>UI assets <ul><li>kenney.nl</li></ul></li><li>Levels<ul><li>Fran\u00e7ois Marques (Novoban)</li><li>Alberto Garc\u00eda (Puzzle)</li></ul></li><li>Music &amp; SFX<ul><li>Eric Matyas</li></ul></li><li>Engine<ul><li>Godot Game Engine</li></ul></li></ul><ul>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1de1e217f3bc8a060f50747d2b122ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shin-NiL"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
