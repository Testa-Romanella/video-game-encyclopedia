His message is just \"keep townsfolk warm\". He didn't even remember that you, too, need to keep yourself warm to go through harsh winter (climate change sucks, man).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hm, okay.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game aimed to be more narrative, but the gameplay is kept as simple as possible for jam submission.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You gonna update later then?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I do want to update later. Polishing, balancing, and\u00a0filling the content.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Oh, yeah, about the game page cover--</em></strong></p>\n<p>I know it's a huge mismatch. Yes, I know. Really sorry for deceiving you. The hot drink in the cover is not even tea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b60b0b8bd8c512d1cc5273cdbb2a2399.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["juunishi master"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
