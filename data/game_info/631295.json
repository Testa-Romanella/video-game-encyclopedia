The game has you go through 20 levels filled with all kinds of challenges that you have to get through. You can jump and infinite amount of times while mid-air but you cannot stop your horizontal momentum. Watch out for death blocks because they will certainly be your doom. There are a total of 3 endings in the game and you will get a star on the title screen for each one!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrow keys - Move<br/>\r\nZ - Jump<br/>Mouse to navigate in menus\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>SeventyFour Productions - Programming / Graphics / Music / Some sounds / Story and concept\r\n</p>\n<p>Bro.
