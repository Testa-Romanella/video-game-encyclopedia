A Leap Motion and Oculus Rift DK2 (with runtime 1.3.0+) are required. </p><p>The best way to get an idea of how it works is to download the demo and do the tutorial, but the YouTube on the right should give you a good idea of what it's like.</p><p>Feedback is extremely welcome! Please let me know if you run into any issues or have any suggestions.</p><p>Thanks to Zach Kinstner for creating the Hovercursor, Hovercast, and Hoverboard libraries (https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hover-VR-I...).</p><p>If you like Superstruct, check out my other VR projects Graffiti 3D (http://jscottk.itch.io/graffiti-3d) and Triangulate (http://jscottk.itch.io/triangulate).</p><p>04/10/16</p><p>- Updated to support Oculus runtime 1.3</p><p>12/21/15</p><p>- Fixed issue with rotating the ball using the mouse or gamepad analog stick and then using Leap Motion controls for locomotion. The user should move in the correct direction now.</p><p>- Fixed issue with Hoverboard buttons; the buttons should no longer always appear on top of hands. </p><p>- Fixed issue with fading to dark and fading in between levels. </p><p>- Fixed issue with gamepad jumping using the A button.</p><p>- Fixed rotation of ball in pipes level; users will face the objective when in ball mode now. </p><p>- Fixed error from attempting to instantiate a null object.</p><p>- Fixed issue with tutorial text not closing properly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b039784dfbea57f38189b59dde0e15a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jscottk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
