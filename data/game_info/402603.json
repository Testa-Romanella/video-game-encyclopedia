However, she has a giant canyon standing in the way of that goal. Draw trampolines by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Don't bounce into a wall, or it's game over!</p>\n<p>Special thanks goes to my friend Lily, who tested the game and informed me that the game speed was tied to the monitor's refresh rate. Kinda embarrassing that I didn't think to use delta time to begin with, huh?</p>\n<p>The game utilizes some collision algorithms from Jeffery Thompson (specifically line/circle), who allows them to be used in programming projects.</p>\n<p>The font used in the game is ManualPrint by Aaron D. Chand, and is free for commercial use.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2100b18a265067a5df6b4fa9fbdb4e55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bluswimmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
