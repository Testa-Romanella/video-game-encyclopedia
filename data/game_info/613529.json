{"id": 613529, "slug": "lavalamp-2", "name": "LAVALAMP", "name_original": "LAVALAMP", "description": "LAVALAMP is a 3D first-person walking simulator with a side of exploration/interaction with the environment.  The game tells the story of the Space Lemmings from Space who, after running many experiments with breakfast alphabet and the space-time continuum, got blocked between dimensions (or something).<br/><br/><br/><br/>LAVALAMP is filled with : <br/><ul><li>cereals<br/></li><li>information about the importance of eating breakfast every morning<br/></li><li>epic(ish) cinematics<br/></li><li>a weird storyline<br/></li><li>cool colours<br/></li><li>stuff that you can click on and it makes cool sounds</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>My name is Gabriel Ledoux, I'm a contemporary music composer and I've been developing LAVALAMP for a year. I'm a big walking simulator fan, and I've always wanted to play one with a very psychedelic feel, a lot of interaction with the environment and experimental music that would be a bit interactive. This game is the first one I've made and will release. I can't wait to show it to the world!<br/><br/>Since it's my first game as a solo dev, it's gonna be free. There will be no ads or informations taken from you, it's just a small weird experiment for you to play. It's gonna last somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes. I've put all my heart in this project!<br/><br/>I've been helped by Thomas Duret, who co-wrote the story and gave me a lot of feedback on the game. There's also Catherine C\u00f4t\u00e9-Moisescu who helped me with social medias. Voice acting is made by Sarah Albu and David E. Cronkite.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is currently under development. We are planning to launch it in Spring 2021.<br/><br/>Add it to your wishlist if you feel like it! It would put a lot of warmth in my heart.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T02:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83ece8e4fa8392fdbaa73994f338c8ca.jpg", "website": "https://lavalampthegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Space Lemmings from Space Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Space Lemmings from Space Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
