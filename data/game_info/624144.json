{"id": 624144, "slug": "vibrations", "name": "Vibrations", "name_original": "Vibrations", "description": "<p>This is a short puzzle game project I worked on for my Audio Programming module at university. The game contains three different rooms with puzzles where the player will learn how to use the main mechanic of the game.\u00a0This mechanic is a gun that the player can use to shoot grey coloured objects to turn them into bombs that explode after a short countdown.</p>\n<p>This project was made to experiment with using Wwise, a sound engine used for sound effects and music in video games. As the main focus of the project was experimenting with audio, every sound in the game was recorded and edited by myself except for the music track (Cynicmusic, 2013) and crate breaking sound (Kevinkace, 2009).</p>\n<p>Audio techniques such as pitch shifting, spatial audio and auxiliary busses for reverb within different spaces were used to make the game feel more immersive.</p>\n\r\nReferences\r\n<p>Cynicmusic.
