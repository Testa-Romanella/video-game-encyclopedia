In the provided level, you are required to use a grappling hook and a gun in order to complete an obstacle course. The faster you are the better the weapons and accessories provided, right?!</p>\n<p>This project is heavily inspired by Portal, one of my favourite game series.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04a/04a2a6bae573dd0c737a74a287508884.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grusso94"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
