The controls are simple only using the arrow keys for moving left, right, and up for jumping. Pressing the up key and will double jump. I had an idea for sharks jumping out the sea, but I didn't know how to incorporate the idea. Also, I had problems fixing the view for the game. I didn't know how to put sound in the game so the game doesn't feel alive, but that will be soon fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/933f63401c601585a6634af09d5f4db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["khalil franklin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
