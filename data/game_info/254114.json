There\u2019s no use in hiding the lasga from me now.\u201d Garfield was right. He had grown too powerful for this mortal realm. \u201cNone can stop me, Jon. My final evolution has yet to be obtained, yet I am more powerful than any living being could ever imagine. You dare disrespect me, or my lasagne, I can make you suffer beyond comprehension. The lengths I can go to, Jon. Will go to. You know it\u2019s no use. Just hand over the lasaga.\u201d Garfield\u2019s hulking form grows closer to the couch Jon hides behind every second. Jon can hear the cat\u2019s sniffing now, like thousands of muffled screams. The stench of millions of rotting lasnas. Jon begins to sob. He knows that Garfield will only punish him further if he continues to hide, yet his body will not move. Garfield\u2019s limbs make a heavy pounding sound as they impossibly carry his enormous frame towards the couch. \u201cPerish, then.\u201d Garfield says, his voice filled with immortal rage, the noise vibrating Jon\u2019s bones. What has Jon created? How did he let this unspeakable evil fester in his home for so long? Will Garfield\u2019s endless hunger ever cease? It is too late now, for Garfield devours Jon\u2019s feeble body in one gulp, absorbing him into the hell that is his body. He feels his previous master sliding down his throat, and as the helpless screaming becomes moaning and sobbing, Garfield grins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/59423c1fe3cd46ae4f0b4d5816ae1a5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MichaelHilliger"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
