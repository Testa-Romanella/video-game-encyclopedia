It never works properly. But that's OK. I have yet to encounter a bug that can't be made into a feature, and so here we are.

Reach the end of each level as fast as possible, or just have fun bouncing around.</p>\n<p>This is an incomplete jam version. More levels to hopefully come soon.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/>Mouse to look<br/>R to restart level<br/>Esc to exit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T03:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fddf1e715be36ab20d12b575b25bb1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Space_man"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
