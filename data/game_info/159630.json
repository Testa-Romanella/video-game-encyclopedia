Your job is to make sure the correct games are installed at the right time. As your master plays a game, the next game he wants to play will become more clear. If you make too many mistakes or make him wait too long he may think about replacing you.</p>\n<p>Music by GreyScreen (Kevin Stebner)</p>\n<p>greyscreen.bandcamp.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/249038d3c4e83eed8bd5975c257cd1b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sean Brown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
