I worked on this project alone for about 2 weeks, so take it for what it is! :) There is no start menu ingame and the game will be closed if you should loose, sorry for this but I didn't have time to fix those things! Should work fine otherways. Enjoy!<br/><br/>I made this project to test out some specific methods in the game engine aswell as learning to \"finish\" a project even when my inner voice tells me to add more and more content, which always ends up with an unfinished/unpublished project. So I most likely won't be working anymore on this one, but hopefully you can expect new projects in the future!</p>\n<p>CONTROLLS</p>\n<p>WASD - move<br/>Use mouse to orient<br/>E - interact<br/></p>\n<p>HINTS<br/>Have the toilet door closed! <br/>The fifth ingredient is a letter, if that isn't clear.<br/><br/>All 3D models except the trees are modelled, rigged and animated by me.</p>\n<p>All audio is from: https://www.freesound.org/.<br/>Most textures are from: http://www.cgtextures.com/.</p>\n<p>Works for PC, Mac and Linux.</p>\n\n<p>-Update 1<br/>Added instructions!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/72384b2f5fd8dec66977a018e614b83c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fetdressing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
