You play as a cell that has to use some kind of tractor beam to lure in the little black cells and turn them red and make them follow you to the cell counter at the end. The more cells the better. Avoid the nasty green cells, they\u2019ll kill you. It\u2019s mighty tricky but could be fun as a later level in the game. We shall see!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A,D,W,S to move, space to zap the black cells with the tractor beam so they follow you, mouse to aim. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee75906b65d959242083e5491c4cfeaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dutchlish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
