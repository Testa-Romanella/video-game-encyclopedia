Be sure to make the right decisions or else you will die, whether it be in a funny or disturbing way. While being a comedy based game, the developer places great effort in making a funny and entertaining game while sharing how inflation is affecting the day to day life of the average German citizen. Will you play the game, hoping to survive or will you find every possible way to die?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>THIS IS A DEMO!</strong></p>\n<p>German Apartment Simulator is still in development and this is the demo of the game!
