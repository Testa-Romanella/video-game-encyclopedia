Player one can use the arrow keys to move and jump. Player two uses the AWD keys. Get to the arrows at the end of each stage to win. After each level, your character will become a little bit better. Starting at level 3 (the water level) your characters can double jump. Player 1 uses the \"L\" key or the number 0 on the number pad, and player 2 uses the \"F\" or \"Q\" key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I programmed this game starting when I was about 12, so it might have some bugs, and the graphics aren't the prettiest in the world, but it's actually a really fun game! You can play it alone, but it's a lot better with a friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently there is an epic remake in progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:28:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a6d96a415c559dffddd26074ce88ed1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oldroyd Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
