When two of\u00a0 the balls touch, the weak one will become strong. For example: a red ball will follow a green ball, since it will transform it into a red ball when touched.</p>Controls:<p>- R: goes back to the main menu for new inputs to be written;</p><p>- P: pauses and unpauses the simulation;</p>\n<p>This simulation was made using the p5.js framework.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T14:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e6ddc6107bfe9b2dd203c1f6a5c6016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Apmds"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
