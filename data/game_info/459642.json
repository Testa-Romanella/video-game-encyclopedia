{"id": 459642, "slug": "ariadnes-nightmare", "name": "Ariadne's Nightmare", "name_original": "Ariadne's Nightmare", "description": "<p><strong>Ariadne's Nightmare</strong> is a short maze puzzle game.</p>\n<p>It's story is set in the Greek mythology. Ariadne and Theseus want to defeat the Minotaur, which is prisoned in an huge maze. For this purpose Ariadne is waiting at the entrance of the maze and is holding a long thread. The other end of the thread is carried by Theseus deep in the maze so he can always find his way out\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>Well, in this story the original plan went a bit wrong...</p>\n\n<p>They both ended up in the maze and the thread got lost under mysterious circumstances. At least they both can roughly locate each other by call and response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In game you can press Space if the red bar in the middle of the screen is filled to let Ariadne call for Theseus. The bar will fill up again by walking around.</p>\n\n<p>Use WASD or the Arrow keys to let Ariadne and Theseus move through this endless maze.</p>\n<p>Of course it would be easy when one of them just waited while the other one approaches slowly, but back in that days people weren't that smart. So if you tell Ariadne to move, Theseus will move in the same direction\u00a0and the other way round.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you can bring them both back together nevertheless!</p>\n<p>This game and every asset, except the font,\u00a0was created only by myself within 48 hours for the United Game Jam 2020. Probably you can guess how this game fits the given theme \"Two\" but for guideline reasons I will explain it: you play two characters at the same time, yay!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c17116505501a7eb6a77f02a1a822be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lpjton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
