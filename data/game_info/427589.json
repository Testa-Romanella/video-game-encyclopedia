Equip your car with dynamite for explosive power to send oncoming traffic flying. Or try a huge wrecking ball welded to the chassis to sweep out any cars, palm trees, or unlucky citizens it touches.<br/>With Speed and Armour upgrades available too, you can transform the beast into a reinforced speed-machine. Then, as you build up your skill you might find yourself flying and flipping through the air in a ballet of carnage.<h3>Hand-crafted Vibes</h3>Everything you see, hear and feel was hand-crafted with love for Dirty Harry\u2019s Thunder Drive, so that you can immerse yourself: sitting in your Red Stallion, driving into the sunset, head-first.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T06:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f661d9e95d0b68edec308c20bc8a7bb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thunder Clap"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Thunder Clap"], "esrb_rating": null}
