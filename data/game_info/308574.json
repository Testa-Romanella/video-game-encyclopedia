You play as an android which can morph it's appearance to switch between different genders (male and female) which can help you along the quests. This links to the film because in the film,\u00a0Ava (the android) uses her sexuality to manipulate Caleb into doing what she wants. Similarly, the gender you are when you interact with non-player characters in the game will impact what conversations are had and how the NPCs interact with you.</p><p>In the attached development posts I will go over my contributions towards the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/3900601c21e9573eba03b8baa1b1a79e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alexfeetham98"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
