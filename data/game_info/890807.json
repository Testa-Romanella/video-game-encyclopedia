For getting the\u00a0 best feeling from this game I recommend playing it in its normal level... Also, you can download the demo for windows for a more immersive experience!</p>\n<p>You'd embark on a journey to save the Sacred Forest, a magical forest in which different creatures live but now attacked by the Selinam kingdom to steal the powers of these creatures stealing also its peace. Help the forest to rescue their leaders and get stronger with their help!</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you like the game please consider leaving a comment and your best scores after you clear the game, mine was 26 kills, 0 deaths in 04:09 minutes, can you beat me?.
