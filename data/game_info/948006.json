Immediately, you're catapulted to journalistic stardom. But once the waters settle, it becomes clear the fireballs were only the beginning of something far more sinister\u2026a deadly threat now lurking in the deeps\u2026 <br/><br/>The Kraken Wakes is the exclusive adaptation of John Wyndham\u2019s epic 1950s sci-fi/horror novel. It uses ground-breaking conversational gameplay: you type or talk to the game\u2019s characters in natural language, influencing their actions and emotions, and shaping the story as it unfolds. Devise eye-catching headlines, deliver knock-out press conference performances, and negotiate with governments in your mission to uncover the truth about the fireballs before it\u2019s too late.<h3>AI-powered Conversation</h3><br/>The Kraken Wakes has been created on Charisma.ai\u2019s AI-powered conversation engine. You\u2019ll speak to the game\u2019s characters, and they'll listen and respond to what you say. There are no multiple-choice options here: you\u2019re free to say what you like, and find out how your words will impact the story.<h3>Believable Characters </h3><br/>In The Kraken Wakes, NPCs (non-player characters) have personalities, memories, opinions and emotions. What you say and do will impact a character\u2019s mood and their relationship with you. Befriend your colleagues or compete with them, impress your boss and win over your sources, all through what you choose to say.<h3>Player-driven Audio</h3><br/>We've worked with the audio team at dBs Pro to create an innovative soundtrack for The Kraken Wakes that adapts to the characters' emotions. If something you say makes a character feel happy, the game audio will become more upbeat, and vice versa. Your words shape not only the story, but also the soundscape of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T03:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/80188ea6dd1302db68f04c07d36e8143.jpg", "website": "https://www.thekrakenwakes.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charisma Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Charisma Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
