This is the result, a platformer where you are a snow man teleported to another world hostile to your melting body. Make sure to make it to the end of the level to get the ice gem that can hopefully change the landscape enough for you to live another day.</p>\n<p>As a part of this team I was a designer that had a hand in deciding how the gameplay should feel, and I also worked on the User Interface of the game and made sure that it fit the idea of playing a snow man. I am also responsible for adding all the music to the game, so you could say I had a hand in choosing the aesthetic for the game. I genuinely had a lot of fun on this project as it was one of the first times that I got to work on a game with a team, where I had a specific role to play and I could spend my time making sure that this was best as it could be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ice is slowly melting so make sure to start playing quick!</p>\n<p>Julian</p>\n<p>12/18/19</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T02:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c2bfc03ebc1119de977eb82a702fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Julian Sollozo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
