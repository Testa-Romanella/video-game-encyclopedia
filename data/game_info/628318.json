Earn money through fishing and upgrade your gear to improve your chances of catching those legendaries!</p>\n<p>Lake Legends is a casual fishing game where the goal is to catch all the fish and collect all the gear. It was made as a student project at\u00a0Forsbergsskola</p>\n<p>The fishing part is a minigame where you need to keep the floater inside the green area which goes back and forth at different speeds and stops at intervals. Each time you fish you use one bait (energy) which regenerates every few minutes</p>\n<p>All fish have different stats and rarities making the game interesting long term and your gear stats work in tandem with the fish stats. Each time you catch something there's a chance that it's a treasure chest containing some gear or a fish worth silver/gold</p>\n<p>Then there's also the market where you can buy clams containing gear or\u00a0bait and the fish ledger where you can track all the fishes you\u2019ve caught</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers:</strong></p>\n<p>Jack Karlsson</p>\n<p>Felix Dauber</p>\n<p>Xiaodi Wang</p>\n<p>Bj\u00f6rn Klarstr\u00f6m</p>\n<p>Johan Hammarstr\u00f6m</p>\n<p>Simon Magnusson</p>\n<p>Linus \u00c5kesson</p>\n<p><strong>Designers:</strong></p>\n<p>Jack Jarvis</p>\n<p>Niklas Ahlsten</p>\n<p>Max Pook</p>\n<p>Matias Gesche</p>\n<p><strong>Artists:</strong></p>\n<p>Sophie Edqvist</p>\n<p>David Carlsson</p>\n<p>Markus \u00c5kesson</p>\n<p>Jacob Romare</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T07:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf6e220464d54c4a43683b3adcc49726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jackoberto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
