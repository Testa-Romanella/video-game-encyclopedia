Downfall of a city.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Playable at:\u00a0http://bravitzlana.com/play/d79e1fa6-8cec-4974-9926-7e1de8227e39</p>\n<p><strong>Apoptosis</strong> is an interactive simulation I made while experimenting with Bravitzlana. It's a mini game engine for making small 3D landscapes with pixel blocks, somewhat like Minecraft.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Use wasd or the arrow keys to move around.</strong></li><li><strong>Right click and\u00a0drag to rotate the camera.</strong></li><li><strong>Mouse-over parts of the scene and also click on them to get snippets of text - they will clue you in to what's going on.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>As the blurb above suggests, this simulation draws parallels between a cell and a city, albeit with a rather bleak undertone... Nevertheless, I hope it manages to circumvent some of\u00a0the technical jargon used in\u00a0cellular biology and\u00a0bring the world under the microscope closer to you. After all, such cells are the tiny units that make up\u00a0your body so I think they are worth taking time to\u00a0understand!</p>\n<p>Though Bravitzlana does allow you to compose and attach short tunes to each object, I decided to make this simulation totally soundless so that it\u00a0fit with the overall feel\u00a0of post-apocalyptic\u00a0desolation. I hope it provides space for a bit of\u00a0somber reflection as you navigate through the scene...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89e/89e4ee4f7078d5a8d3318b1dc05e780c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
