This game was made over the course of 5 days in unreal engine, and the entire process was documented on my youtube at PerfectPenguini. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you have quite a beefy computer, or at all really. It can be pretty fun to just walk around in for a bit, but it doesn't even have much of an objective.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T13:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2ea23923a0dcf987c504ce8acaee000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PerfectPenguini"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
