Please bear in mind this game is in the early Alpha phase so while it should be stable (from my testing it runs fine),\u00a0 things will likely change before the final release (e.g. refining balance, adding more skills to each class, etc.)</p>\n<p>Thank you, and have fun!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:33:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52a/52a2197d91c9b12cd426ab1424f67080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rholleman"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
