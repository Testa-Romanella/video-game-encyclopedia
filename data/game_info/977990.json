Players will act as a wuxia riding on a bamboo, and try to defeat your rival using only 2 joysticks on your gamepad.<h3>SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE</h3>Use left joystick to <strong>Bend</strong> bamboo, and use right joystick to <strong>Wave</strong> sword. It's just that easy. You and your friends can learn as soon as you hold your gamepad.<br/><br/>The control and mechanics are simple, but winning is not. Take full control of your body, sword, and manage the bamboo.<h3>The Bamboo</h3><strong>Left Joystick</strong> is for Body and Bamboo. Push your joystick alongside the bamboo to climb up/down, or push towards other angles to bend the bamboo.<br/><br/>Build your momentum to one-hit kill. Climb down to the bottom and have a close combat. Intentionally get injured and free your leg to move wildly. <br/><br/><h3>The Blade</h3><strong>Right Joystick</strong> is for Blade. When you hit, it makes a difference to hit different body part. Your Blade can parry rival's blade. <br/><br/>Parry rival's sword and do a counter attack. Attack your rival's flailing limbs with a precise slash! Or simply wait your rival to dash into your sword.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T10:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6feb10789534079499764b7500163972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blaer Zhang", "Linke Huang"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blaer Zhang"], "esrb_rating": null}
