The theme was \"Unstable\" so I made a game based on a burning house that can collapse at any moment. There's people stuck inside there and you gotta help them!</p>\n<p>All assets (excluding sound effects) were made by me! And I made this game from ground up all by myself, using Unity as the engine! It was tough because I had zero experience with game jams (even going for the Jam category) and\u00a0I didn't really know much about Unity (I joined this jam just to learn it), but I feel like I've learned a lot with this little project!</p>\n<p>(PS: I'm not sure if this game works on all platforms, but it works on Windows, that's for sure. Could someone tell me if it also works on Mac or Linux?)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b3274438a83e81ad666a6006cfa42146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arthurgps2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
