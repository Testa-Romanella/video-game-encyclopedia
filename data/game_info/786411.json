You embody one of the ex lover and try to destroy the more you can in a time limit. For that, you can find and craft weapons to massively destroy your opponent's house !<br/></p>\n<p>Use ZQSD to move, SPACE to jump and Mouse to move camera and destroy things (Right click to Melee and Left to Shoot)\u00a0. To craft things, press R.</p>\n<p>Joysticks to move, A to Jump, B to release, X to hit melee and Triggers to shoot. Y to craft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T09:57:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28066f950a3ef4aa24ce310222f9654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas_D76"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
