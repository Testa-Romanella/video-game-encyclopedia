You play as an echidna whose burrow has been turned into a maze by moles, and you must activate each level's portal and take it to escape. Careful block placement is key to solving each puzzle; press switches, use warps, and do all you can to get the blocks where they belong.<br/></p>\n<p>This is an early v0.1 pre-alpha demo of Maze Burrow. This short demo serves to gather feedback on the game concept and make improvements for future iterations. <br/></p>\n<p>After playing, it would be greatly appreciated if you fill out the following form or post in the discussion boards with your feedback: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_s9-nukxcBmERZ6k38GLZY6wbXRd7wNccldmJ...<br/></p>\n<p>If you encounter any bugs, please report them in the respective stickied topic in the discussion boards.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
