A simple wireframe editor allows for quick creation of the structure layout. In panel mode, all automatically spawned panels can then be customized and modified. Panels can also be hidden and added separately if needed. In Part mode, you can decorate the structure with a variety of objects to give it a \"lived-in\" feel. The main purpose of this toolkit is to allow the community and gamedevs to think up and create unique structures for their game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo convert the structures into Unity prefabs, which you can then easily integrate into your game world, the MOENTO converter sold in the Unity asset store must be purchased.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T02:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6fe36c3de7e9c3e09d68d097350320.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bblessed"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["bblessed"], "esrb_rating": null}
