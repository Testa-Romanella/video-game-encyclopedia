We had too high ambition and ended up only having 1/4 of planned features. Also, those dialogue boxes were supposed to have some cut scene animations in between, but since we're running out of time, so yeah...\u00a0<br/><br/>It's a 2D platformer game, a story about Brett who had lost his memory and met John, whom they planned to stop the evil scientist... or the other way around... Wanna know why is this story made for the theme 'You are the villain'? Keep reading the dialogues to find out...\u00a0<br/><br/>This game is made in Game Maker 8.0 Pro and Game Maker 8.1 Lite for level designing. I used a platformer engine and dialogue box engine to speed up the process, but still couldn't achieve that with our game's high ambition... But anyway, it is still playable with a lot of missing features. We're planning to finish this game in the future for release.\u00a0<br/><br/>P.S.: Our second Ludum Dare Jam, first time to actually finished a playable game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d36/d36ecf6bfa33a4877f80e6fe60af0a1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NikorasuChan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
