To advance you have to press the key you are on. But don't take too long, because once the game starts (when the score appears) the floor will start to shake, and after a time it will fall, and if you don't type fast enough the letter on it, you will fall with it.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Feel free to post any bugs/issues/suggestions.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing and I hope you enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:33:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/4931d155d3f108c93c31a7764f8ab5de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["partialmoon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
