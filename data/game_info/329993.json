The game is playable but there are still thouthands of bugs and prototype art, and the amount sf crafting items is also very minimal. The game has no menus and a lot of player feedback is missing. Because of that we consider this more an early prototype to get the jist of the game concept rather than a finished game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7bd7bec26708585a8ba7079f36d3035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mastergammler"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
