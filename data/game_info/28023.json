So draw a \n      line in the sand and fight to protect it! As you explore the desert and \n      solve puzzling dungeons, you'll gather resources to build up your oasis \n      with the water spirit Esna. Allies will join your cause, so equip them \n      with weapons, and use their skills to slay towering bosses.\n    </p><p>\n      The Ever Oasis\u2122 game is a new action-adventure RPG grown from the ground \n      up by Koichi Ishii, creator of the Mana series and producer at GREZZO, \n      the studio that rebuilt multiple The Legend of Zelda\u2122 games for the \n      Nintendo 3DS\u2122 family of systems. Their team has crafted puzzles and \n      traps too perilous for one hero to solve. So recruit a party of allies \n      and level up their stats to learn new battle skills. Then return to your \n      oasis and restore it: choose which shops to build, stock their \n      inventories, collect a share of the profits, and keep villagers happy by \n      fulfilling requests. Before long your oasis will blossom into a beacon \n      of hope for all walks of life in the desert. Don't let them down.\n    </p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-29T15:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd8f58cb06a8344eb8f3cbe5c81d6d23.jpg", "website": "http://everoasis.nintendo.com/", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 5, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 4, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Grezzo"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
