{"id": 463372, "slug": "wordfind-multiplayer-peer-to-peer", "name": "WordFind - Multiplayer (peer-to-peer)", "name_original": "WordFind - Multiplayer (peer-to-peer)", "description": "<p>This is a multiplayer <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> word finding game where you compete to find the given word in a grid of letters. You can find the word horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Once you find a word, you get a point and win the round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each round has a selection of 80 words to play in random order. When all words have been played, it will pick from the words you've already played again.<br/></p>\n<p>There's no real finish line, you play as many rounds you want until you feel you're done. Whoever has the most points in the end wins.</p>\n<p>As it is a peer-to-peer game, it means there's no external server which transmits game data between players. Whoever creates a game becomes the host/server of the game and the players joining the game joins the host. Therefore the player who acts as the host of a game automatically transmits data between all players and acts as a server while also being a player.\u00a0If you have a slow or unreliable internet connection, you and the players who connect to you may experience a slow gameplay and/or disconnections. <br/></p>\r\nCreating a new game\r\n<p>On the \"game creation\" screen, you can enter how many players will be playing and the difficulty of the game. The difficulty is simply based on how many letters are present on the screen. \"Easy\" has a 10x10 grid of letters, \"Medium\" has a 13x13 grid of letters and \"Hard\" has a 15x15 grid of letters.</p>\n<p>Once you have created the game, you will have to invite some people to play with you by sharing your unique room name with them. When a player wants to join your game, they will appear in the list of joining players. You then have to select the players you want to allow into the game and press the \"allow\" button. This just gives you more control as the host of the game  in case someone uninvited tries to join.\r\n</p>\r\nJoining an existing game\r\n<p>On the \"join game\" screen, you can join a game that already has been created. You need the unique room name provided by the game host and put it into the field. It's the game host who decides if you can join or not.<br/></p>\r\nGame mechanics\r\n<p>Once a game has been created and all players have connected to it, a round can begin. All players have to press the \"start game\" button for a new round to start. Then a word will be served for you to find as a message at the top, as well as in the message log that is present on the right hand side of the game. All players get the same word to find.</p>\r\nSelecting a word\r\n<p>When you find the word, select it by clicking on the first or last letter and drag the mouse over the entire word.\u00a0Each letter selected will show up as a darker color. You can select a word horizontally, vertically and diagonally. Then click again to lock the entire selection. If it's the correct word you're looking for, and no-one else has found it before you, you get a point and win the round!</p>\r\nClearing a selection\r\n<p>If you started selecting a word but change your mind, you can clear the selection by pressing the right button on your mouse.<br/></p>\r\nBugs/Errors/Feedback\r\n<p>If you find that something isn't working as it should in the game, feel free to leave a comment below and I will have a look at it. It's very appreciated!
