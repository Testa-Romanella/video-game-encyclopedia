{"id": 777409, "slug": "dwarf-workday", "name": "Dwarf Workday", "name_original": "Dwarf Workday", "description": "<p><strong>Dwarf Workday</strong> is an adventure-platformer where you play as a\u00a0little Dwarf in a classic workday down the mine.<br/>Explore the mine, hook, find raw diamonds and refine them with two giant hammers.</p>\n<p>You can hook to the walls in order to mine raw diamonds. If you found enough diamond of the same color you'll unlock a new power up (for example a longer rope, or a way to hook upwards).</p>\r\nThis game was made in 13 days for the Gamedev.js Jam 2022 where we had to implement\u00a0web monetization\u00a0and the theme \"Raw\" into a game. For the theme I decided to introduce this dwarf that needs to find raw diamonds by exploring\u00a0a mine. About the\u00a0web monetization part I put a little yellow radar that can help people find the raw diamonds more easily. To activate web monetization the player\u00a0needs to activate a subscription on the\u00a0Coil site.\r\n<p>\u00a0Follow me on twitter if you like my game\u00a0<strong>@hav24\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>- WASD or Arrow keys to move.\r\n<br/>\r\n- \"X\" to jump.\u00a0<br/>- \"C\" to hook.<br/>- \"UP\" + \"C\" to hook upwards (it works only after unlocking this power up)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets were made by me,\u00a0 Alessandro Pezzetti aka havana24<br/>8bit sound effects made with Bfxr and Freesound.<br/>Background music by Playonloop.com<br/>Game made with Godot.</p>\n<p>A game made by\u00a0<strong>havana24.net\u00a0</strong>Twitter\u00a0<strong>@hav24\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T13:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e9cc774d266ba80678eab73351527a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Havana24"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
