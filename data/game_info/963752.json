You'll be tasked with delivering minerals to your corporate overlords and fending off waves of local fauna before they can disrupt your mining operation. To do this, you can choose from a variety of structures with different strengths and weaknesses to build and upgrade. Of course, this all depends on the difficulty setting you choose, as this will affect the range of systems available to you to complete your mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe aware, however, that building, upgrading and repairing structures is not a company expense and must be paid for out of your own pocket! So choose wisely what you build, upgrade or repair and when you pay for it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrakken Industries would love to welcome a new Mining Operations Manager, with new positions becoming available every minute, there is always a place in our family.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T06:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da965e0370e1fcf30570af24e9c8472c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Placeholder Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Placeholder Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
