Players take the role of the brave Princess or her faithful Fianc\u00e9 as they maneuver the departed king's coffin-on-wheels through 25 levels set in 5 vibrant underground environments, with his majesty's ghost giving them a piece of his mind every step of the way. Filled to the brim with emergent physics-based gameplay, Chariot offers hours of exciting exploration, fast-paced ride sequences and mountains upon mountains of loot! <strong>Notice: We highly recommend playing Chariot with a controller.</strong>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2014-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145d1ab07f91ad62f9d974c03d204096.jpg", "website": "http://www.chariotgame.com", "rating": 3.18, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 750, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 55, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 401, "ratings_count": 89, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 89, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Wii U", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Anuman Interactive", "Frima Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microids Indie", "Frima Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
