The type of place to remove your mind from the bustle of city life in the pursuit of solitude. Solitude, however, can be elusive, and strange adventures can arise anywhere at anytime. <br/><br/>Did they come from a distant world in outer space or from deep within the Earth\u2019s crust? Perhaps they were formed by the very fibers of man\u2019s worst intentions, a cosmic comeuppance for lives misspent. Whatever their origin, these are the facts; they don\u2019t rest, they can\u2019t be reasoned with, and their intent is singular; to extinguish mankind wherever they step foot.<br/><br/>Shore up your home, take up arms, and hope the night ends with this terrible enemy returning from whence they came.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Defend your home against an onslaught of monstrous invaders using whatever you can to keep them at bay. Use your nail gun to board up the doors and build your defenses, but even that won\u2019t stop them for long. They\u2019ll tear through your doors and barricades, so put your guns on your belt and prepare to fight them tooth and nail.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Unique nail gun mechanic for building up your barricades to slow down monsters<br/></li><li>Relentless AI that will stop at nothing in their pursuit to track you down and kill you.<br/></li><li>Two weapons for blasting the monsters back into oblivion.<br/></li><li>Beautiful and horrifying sound design that builds a serious sense of peril.<br/></li><li>A beautifully stylized world</li></ul><br/><strong>Future</strong><br/><ul><li>Additional game modes, meaning new goals in new places, with new tools to get the job done.<br/></li><li>Story mode. <br/></li><li>Improved mechanics.
