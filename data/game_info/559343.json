It also\u00a0decreases jump height. For this reason, it is important to develop skill in timing the shift while in mid-air in order to have full-height jumps that can also cover more distance.</li><li>Use Microsoft Edge because Chrome lags to an unplayable extent on full-screen.</li></ul><p>A wholesome platformer with pleasant characters. The platforming can be challenging, however short, so don't let the music fool you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some people.. ahem.. birds... can be down-right rude. Who cares? Friendly rabbits such as yourself will spare no effort to hang out with them. However, this tree climb is not for the timid of heart, especially if you haven't taken the time to understand the movement mechanics. So be careful, and happy climbing.</p>\n<p>This game was made with speed-running in mind so feel free to share final times.
