Glasses were shattered, tables were smashed and almost everything was destroyed, the owner of the tavern was really not pleased. And he's double your sizes combined. Better get to repair everything before he adds you two to the \"broken stuff\" list.</p>\n\n<p>This game is for two players on the same computer, you will have a series of words each, the one who types more of them win. The keyboard is -obviously- shared. Good luck</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n\n<p>Game Design: Leonardo Gatteschi<br/>Graphics and Illustrations: Marco Fabbri, Stefano Cenci<br/>Programming: Stefano Palma, Erica Stella<br/>Music: Valerio de Vittorio<br/>Sounds: Mattia Giovanetti</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bb0f981d91f4c921342637b6e4747d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindtricks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
