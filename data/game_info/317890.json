Throughout his path the player will engage with enemies (represented by a ghost form of himself) which he must shoot to move on forward, each enemy will randomly grant \u201ctales\u201d sided coins of one the 3 different types. When the time is up the level ends and the achieved score in coins will be counted in both \u201cheads\u201d and \u201ctales\u201d sides, each coin-type pair (of \u201chead\u201d and \u201ctales\u201d) counts as a full coin. Then the player can buy from a given inventory a map item (e.g. floor-tile, ramp-tile, suspended-platform, block-item etc.) for a determinate amount of Red, Green and Blue Coin. The game ends when all map items are coloured.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/023632644d0deded07065366c1a1daef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["bernardolivera"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
