It is a shoot 'em up with puzzle elements and was critically appraised at release. The objective is to clear a fleet of spaceships of hostile robots by destroying them or taking them over via a mini-game. It was later remade as Paradroid 90 for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers and as Paradroid 2000 for the Acorn Archimedes. There exist several fan-made remakes for modern PCs. In 2004 the Commodore 64 version was re-released as a built-in game on the C64 Direct-to-TV, and in 2008 for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74aec72acc5a87f4e6ba11c750b2f502.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "iOS", "Wii"], "developers": ["Graftgold"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Hewson Consultants"], "esrb_rating": null}
