So here I am, making a 3D FPS Shooter in GM Studio 1.4.<br/></p>\n<p>Special Force Bravo (or S.F. Bravo) is a <strong>fast-paced modern FPS</strong> made in GameMaker Studio 1.4. It is now in early development stage. Gameplay-wise, it will ressemble Call of Duty and Counter Strike. Maps will not be large and I dont expect vehicles &amp; driving either. What I expect is more emphasis on weapon customization.</p>\n\n\r\nRoadmap", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T01:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d774328e78fb9947924fd5ac307a36e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vmgangsta7"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
