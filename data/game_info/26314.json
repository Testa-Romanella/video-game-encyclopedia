Max is a three foot \"rabbity thing\" with a saw blade grin and \n      the impulsive nature of the average pirhana. Together, they patrol the \n      sticky streets of a fantastical New York City, righting wrongs, \n      pummeling perps, and ridding the urban landscape of the shifty legions \n      of \"self-propelled gutter trash.\"\n    </p><p>\n      Features\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Story-driven Gameplay<br/>High-quality production values, funny \n      engaging stories, sarcastic, outrageous characters, and bizarre \n      locations come together into what has been described as gaming's first \n      interactive sitcom. Each episode has a self-contained plot but is also \n      part of a larger, season-wide mystery.
