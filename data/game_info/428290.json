Its action takes place in a striking provincial Russia, and any of your actions or inaction can lead to serious consequences. You play as a brave agent Red from Russia, who is entrusted with finding a way out in a vast world full of dangers, anomalies, dark gates and abandoned buildings.<br/><br/>It is important to know exactly the path that your hero should go - this helps to prevent a large number of rash decisions. But at the same time you should be guided by professional skills. Correctly posed questions and behavior will help you achieve your goal.<br/><br/>Most of the game events are focused primarily on spatial parameters, and other creatures have access to the game, but do not have game experience and can mislead you, up to the need to go towards the dark alleys.<br/><br/>To find a way out, you need not to be afraid of traps and be able to accurately find the target. Remember that when you forget where and how to look for a way out, it is difficult to detect; the more difficult the situation, the more difficult it is to find a way out.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T14:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54b35d747b3b6950d6a51b7fcfd2552a.jpg", "website": "https://andreev.world", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andreev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Andreev"], "esrb_rating": null}
