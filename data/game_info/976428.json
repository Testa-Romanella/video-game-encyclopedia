{"id": 976428, "slug": "arcaneoutpost", "name": "ArcaneOutpost", "name_original": "ArcaneOutpost", "description": "<h3>Game Overview</h3>This is a strategy game combining tower defense and MOBA elements.<br/><br/>In the game, you will play as a wise mage, a guardian adept in arcane arts.<br/>Your will is manifested through the establishment of arcane outposts, standing tall in the treacherous, uninhabited frontiers.<br/>You must face waves of enemies and ultimately use the Arcane Core to purify the entire region.<br/><br/>Strategically, balancing investment in building production and defensive capabilities is key to decision-making.<br/>Additionally, you need to choose different building upgrade tiers and enhancement abilities to face varying battles.<br/><br/>On the battlefield, you will control guardians wielding arcane powers, striking enemies with positioning and skill deployment.<br/>Guardians have 4 different skills, each with several modes that can be swapped to perform distinctly different functions.<br/><br/>To adjust the pace of the game, we have not adopted traditional real-time strategy, but rather divided the game into a preparatory phase for decision-making and a combat phase to resist enemies.<br/>Thus, you don't need to worry about being attacked while building or being interrupted by the need for building upgrades while deploying skills.<br/><br/>The game's basic map mode is relatively simple. If you seek a higher challenge, you can choose mutation factors to strengthen enemies and weaken yourself, aiming for higher scores.<br/><br/>If you find bug or have suggestions, please send email to us.
