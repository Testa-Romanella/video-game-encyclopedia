The prompt for that week was food so I\u00a0thought though food related settings like\u00a0bars and restaurants. Eventually I\u00a0thought of picnics, and the general idea of falling bird poo and\u00a0food management among family members\u00a0came from there. I\u00a0was also thinking about games like Overcooked and which led to the hectic feeling of this game.</p>\r\nLicense for the Font Used in the Game\r\n<p>(This is also included in the downloads as a .txt file)</p>\n<p>https://notabug.org/HarvettFox96/ttf-pixeloperator/src/master/LICENSE<br/></p>\n<p>The font is also available here:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/pixel-operator.font</p>Audio Attributions:<p>https://freesound.org/people/zolopher/sounds/44203/</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/dobroide/sounds/185134/</p><p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/412068/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd30db48d2aa0ee866e6788ef4c211ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["RahulJoshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
