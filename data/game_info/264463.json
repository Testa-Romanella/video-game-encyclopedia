By doing that you collect experience points and level up to increase your stats and skills. Find rare items and upgrade them to the max to become #1 of all players in your personal offline Sm4R world! Sm4R is a satire of typical MMORPG grinders. You'll be involved in varied and weird stories that may or may not remind you of your personal MMO experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sm4R features:</strong><br/>- Over 60 maps containing more than 300 unique monsters<br/>- 12 boss monster maps<br/>- 5 special maps with many diverse minigames (for example a trading card battle arena)<br/>- Over 1300 unique items to equip and activate<br/>- Over 500 different skills to learn<br/>- 150 levels (each level unlocks new items and skills)<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><br/>This demo version is limited to level 30</strong>. However there is a way to increase the limit to level 50 which talented players who like challenges will find out.</p>\n<p>The fastest Closed Beta tester reached level 30 after 5:47 hours. And there is even more to explore in the demo after that.\u00a0Have fun!</p>\n<p><em>The full version will be availlable in late 2019</em></p>\n\n<p>If the game crashes after the EULA screen, try to set compatibilityMode=1 in the settings.ini or make sure\u00a0VC++ redist 2013 is installed on your PC. (I think this problem only appears on a few\u00a0Windows XP/Vista/7 machines where that software is not installed by default).\u00a0And report any bugs you find! I'll fix them for the next patch.</p>\n\n<p>Visit my website and Twitter page or join my Discord server\u00a0for updates:<br/>Website<br/>Twitter<br/>Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab0dc9b38d207e819b63801e954b6ef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScimitarDD"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
