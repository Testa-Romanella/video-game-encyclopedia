It started really small with only one level but i liked the experience of developing a game and I expanded the project further.</p>\n<p> My goal was to make a playable fun game with all the features that I could put into it, with only 2 weeks time in my disposal. Eventually, I end up working on the game for 3 and a half weeks(that was the inspiration for the title). So, when I started I thought that making a game would be easy because \"it's just a platformer game\". What I learned in the process was that it's more difficult than I thought, but at the same time developing a game was much more fun than I expected. I hope you like the end result.... enjoy <br/></p>\n\n<p>MOVE: w, a, s, d<br/></p>\n<p>JUMP: space</p>\n<p>SOUND: there is a chance that you can't hear the music or the SFX, just turn volume all the way up and you 'll be fine.<br/></p>\n<p>ENEMIES: Unfortunately, you can't use the hero's hammer, but you can kill the enemies by jumping on them.<br/></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Fun fact_1: </em>Two of my friends and I tried to make another biiiigggg game and we named the team that we created \"2weeks\", because my friends where\r\n having fun with me telling \"oh you can make a game in 2 weeks, it's not that hard\"...</li><li><em>Fun fact_2:</em> The cover image and the victory scene at the end of the game is a tribute to the \"2weeks\" team we created with my friends.
