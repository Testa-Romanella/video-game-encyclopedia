Humanity's numbers are dwindling, but rising robot labour costs have created a need to increase human labour forces to save costs. <br/><br/>The Earth Transit Authority, trying to cut costs has hired you to perform tasks once performed by a more expensive robot. It is your job to sort Proprietary Units for Transport and Containment, objects created by the ETA to simplify transportation of goods all around the world. But your task will not remain so simple, as the ETA continues to increase your workload, and their profit margins.<br/><br/>In light of humanity's newfound importance, a small group of new employees are taking advantage of the situation to try and topple the status quo. Assist your fellow humans by moving the resistance's equipment, or maintain the status quo, siding with your robotic overlords. The choice is yours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e4c215a9ce4aec14ab77314d7c7bbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toxodon Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Toxodon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
