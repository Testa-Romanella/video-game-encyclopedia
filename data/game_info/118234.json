The subtle and eerie sounds will create a unique experience while the player will be immersed in a child\u2019s frightening night.<br/></p>\n<p>The player will have to keep the toys in their sight to make them stop moving, if they look away from them, they will get closer and closer until eventually the player is devoured! The player will have to promptly react to monsters around them as such they will never have the chance to rest. Since this would cause the fatigue/tiredness to catch up to the player character, making the player character fall asleep.</p>\n<p>This is a fast and tensive game, no time to relax, no time to sleep!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961581dc3b3a0fc0f948675573364cce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VickySeven Design", "Antics Interactive", "Robert_Griffiths"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
