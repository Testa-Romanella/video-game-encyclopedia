In 2039 at a remote base in Siberia\u00a0the first mixed species hybrid was made, it was 62% human 38% silver back gorilla, a dream of the old Soviet empire was finally realized, and a door was unlocked that would change the world forever. Military experiments eventually discovered that\u00a0\u00a0humans spliced with dominant feline genes were the most successful, from a military point of view. They were smart, very smart...and ruthless. In 2054 the feline hybrids had become a threat and were quickly becoming the dominant species on the planet. A negotiated re-settlement to the Mars colonies saved us....until then\u00a0they returned. Humanities only hope is a human/canine\u00a0\u00a0hybrid developed to be a loyal defender of Earth. 67% human and 33% Bull Terrier, they are humans only hope at avoiding annihilation.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad434897a33d68a4a3eadf60396efa83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dubyastudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
