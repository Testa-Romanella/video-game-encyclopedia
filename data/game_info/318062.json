And usually the latter is the real world? It could be sleepwalking, or\u00a0schizophrenia, or some kind of feverish disease, and it usually causes some sort of destruction in the \"real world.\"</p>\n<p>You probably don't know. I asked a bunch of my friends and none of them knew what I was talking about. But anyway, that's the idea I based this game on.\u00a0It's a short sequence and the sound effects need a lot of work (I've never done sound in Unity before other than a voiceover or music, plus I\u00a0was just looking up free sounds online). But I think it gets the idea across. Maybe. It's a strange and convoluted idea to begin with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119542f7ac556ddd5db55927f325eed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hxhdrn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
