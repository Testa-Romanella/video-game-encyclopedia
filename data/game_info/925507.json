What makes this game unique is that all the art and dialog, as well as text descriptions, have been created by AI.<br/>\u00a0 -Chatgpt<br/><br/>For this\u00a0game jam I\u00a0wanted to try and create a game with all content made\u00a0entirely with AI. It was originally going to just be\u00a02d but it was hard\u00a0fit different generated content together.\u00a0The background art, items art, dialog and description text, music, as well as some code use AI. The only real thing not created by AI in the game\u00a0is most of the coding and the\u00a03d\u00a0robot.</p><p>To fit things together\u00a0I ended up going\u00a0with a classic 2.5 pre-rendered background\u00a0style that games like\u00a0alone in the dark and resident evil 1 that used\u00a0\u00a0back before computer hardware was powerful enough to render everything. That way all the different camera angles in the AI generated\u00a0content wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>The game uses 2 active cameras with invisible meshes are being\u00a0used that still\u00a0write to the z-index allowing the background to render over the player, and allows for pathfinding in the scenes. And special\u00a0shaders were setup to also\u00a0catch the shadows from the player while still being invisible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb1825330328a94a25d27b228a6f36e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lukeph"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
