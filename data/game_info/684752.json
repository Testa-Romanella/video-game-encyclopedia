These levels won't be easy as known enemies lurk in the corners. But you have your beloved friend cheese to rely on which you can use to defend against these enemies. One\u00a0cheese ball can kill a bat, three can kill the cat and the spiders will have to be outrun. If you reach the kitchen, you must\u00a0remember that\u00a0objects there will fall so don't stay anywhere too long.
