One day while\u00a0partying with some friends, Jack realized Robert has run out of hot sauce, so he has \u201casked\u201d him to go get some more. Such an errand sounds quite simple, but little does Robert know that this errand will take him through TIME AND SPAAAAACE!</strong></strong></p>\r\nThe Characters\r\n\r\nRobert\r\n<p><strong>The most boring and simple person in the world, and the main protagonist.</strong></p>\n\r\nSabrina\r\n<p><strong>A scientist who's been searching for the ancient Hot Sauce of Wisdom.</strong><br/></p>\r\nThe Gameplay\r\n<p><strong>The RPG mechanics are just the usual stuff you\u2019d probably expect, just simplified, such as having no equippable items, (armor, weapons, etc.) and having no need for grinding. There\u2019s also \"augs\" which the player can purchase to unlock new skills for both main characters.</strong></p>\r\nOther Bits of Info\r\n<p><strong>The game is currently still in development, but you can keep track (sorta) of what's being worked on over here at the Trello. I also have a dev blog.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc81d64a7f0365cf8cf8b52d63e524c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Kat Productions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
