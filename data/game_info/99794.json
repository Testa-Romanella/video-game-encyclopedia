Find the collectables to unlock memory-segments, and learn a bit of Hubris&#39; backstory prior to the game!Hubris was a project made by five first-year students at Hedmark University College of Applied Sciences, Norway.This was a group project we made as part of our evaluation in programming and art for our first year. The task was pretty much to make a demo or prototype to show these off.This is also pretty much the first actual game of this kind at least a few of us have ever made, and thus there will be a bug or two, but overall it will be playable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-29T13:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b94/b9420389b344cb6be16f991043fbb93c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Great Question Productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
