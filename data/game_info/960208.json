Determined to take things to the next level, you embark on a journey to meet her in person and win the approval of her family. But your decision to leave behind your friend Selina and her mother Veronica for a month doesn't sit well with them. As you navigate the challenges ahead, you begin to wonder if you've gotten yourself into a messy situation. Will you be able to make peace with Selina and Veronica and prove to Ella's family that you're worthy of their acceptance? How far are you willing to go to pursue the love of your life and build a future together? Only time will tell as you chart a course through the unknown and grapple with the difficult choices that lie ahead.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Seducing the Devil is a story-based Visual Novel in which players are faced with a series of choices that determine their future. The central question that drives the game is \"Lust or Love?\" Players will have to navigate the seductive pull of evil forces that seek to control them, and weigh it against the guidance and protection offered by an innocent being who is willing to stand by them no matter the consequences. The ultimate decision is yours: will you give in to temptation or follow your heart?  <br/><br/><br/><br/>If you're a fan of curvy women and a lot of sexual content, \"Seducing the Devil\" is the game for you. With 16 beautiful female characters at your disposal, you can explore a wide variety of lewd situations across different narrative branches. The game's pre-determined phase provides players with a clear understanding of the branching options available, before delving into the four different branches, each with its own unique plot and set of women to discover.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Note: The character models and their renders have undergone updates and improvements over time. As a result, some scenes may appear differently in terms of the render quality and character design. I'm actively working to remaster all of the content in the game, and your patience is appreciated as I continue to improve the overall experience for the players.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T04:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/549800772ba7074a48daaca734fe437f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Deafperv"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Deafperv"], "esrb_rating": null}
