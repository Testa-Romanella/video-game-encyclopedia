The same key is also used for advancing monologues.<br/></p>\n<p>Shift (or K) will activate focus mode. Not that it's very useful here...</p>\n<p>Your enemies will disappear if you get close enough to them. They cannot hurt you from up close.<br/></p>\n<p>Apologies if an experienced shooter player finds this game too easy. I balanced it for me, and I'm not very good.</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 versions: The one using the original, very limited color palette, and one with a higher contrast palette. Honestly, I recommend the higher contrast version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T21:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d42f405162a14d6098b0e4e6c08913f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["May Redwood"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
