I oficially failed main task. My first build was somewgere near 3 hours, but I encountered some strange export bug when everythyng worked in editor, but crushed after windows export without any error. So It took me at least 6 hours for first build, two to three hours for second and I honestly have no idea how long I was \"polishing\"\u00a0 third build.<br/><br/>2. About game. This is classic 2D spaceplane/aircraft shoot-em-up game with minor tweaks. As last humanity hope, you are piloting cargo plane with BFG mounted on top of it. (Plane and UFO models made in Kenney's Assets Forge and exported as sprites).<br/>This BFG is a absolute killing machine, if only you will keep killing aliens, or you will run out of energy both for the gun and plane turbines. Aliens will warp right into the battlefield with shield protection, but they'll became vulnurable as soon as they try to shoot at you. Best tactic to for killing them and collecting energy will be shooting top ones. Without those nasty antigravity turned on - they ships quite heavy and noone will be glad to recieve their tap to the head.<br/><br/>3. Game might be unbalanced since a had no time to polish it more. I'll might come back to finalyze it (add some bosses, fine-tune balance e.t.c.).<br/><br/>4. Honestly, idk what say more. Just try the game and give your honest opinion.<br/>Controls are: W - to fly UP, S - to fly down, Space - to shoot 'em all!<br/><br/>p.s. Have a nice day!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c4fc0345610008173df7c3b5fa7419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["deusalgor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
