Welcome to the Itch.io page of Greg RPG.</p>\n<p>Greg RPG is an in-development RPG. You play as the titular Greg on his quest to get back his house which is being occupied by an old woman with dastardly plans to make money on his property.</p>\n<p>Greg can fulfill this goal by going around the town and fighting enemies or playing minigames for items, money and experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently, you can download a short tech demo with minimal content. It is likely very buggy - this is where you come in! Hopefully! If I can get people to playtest this, it'll come out much better over all, I hope.</p>\n<p>Greg, if released, would be my first full game project ever! And I do realise that it's way too ambitious. I mean, it's been in development since April 2022 and all I can show off is a tech demo with barely anything in it. This is not good advertising so let's move on...</p>\n<p>All the music in the game was made by me, in Jummbox. All the art assets were drawn by me or used with permission from friends. This means that Greg has an overall low quality feel to it, but I hope that I can use the \"first game\" excuse here. And I do personally think that there is some charm to it.</p>\n<p>Well, that is all that I can say about it now... You should totally download the demo and give me feedback. That is all.</p>\n<p>Some more info about the game<br/></p>\n\r\nGreg (it's him) and also multipanther and bike ghost", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T19:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01eb257614b5e56201b8086a8e191224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Lythr0nax"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
