My goal was also to make a retro-style game. </p>\n<p>This game is a bit more complicated, however. You're ice fishing, so you have to cut holes in the ice, and you can use bait to attract fish. </p>\n<p>Each fish is worth $1 to $3. In addition to being your score, you can use this to buy various types of bait. Each bait has different properties: some attract fish at greater distances, some keep fish interested longer, and some are less likely to be lost once you reel in a fish.</p>\n<p><strong>MOVING AROUND </strong><br/>Use the arrow keys to move your fisherman. Press Ctrl to make a hole in the ice. <br/><br/><strong>FISHING </strong><br/>When over a hole in the ice, press the arrow keys to move your line up and down. Press Ctrl to reel in, hooking any attached fish in the process. <br/><br/><strong>BUYING BAIT </strong><br/>To buy bait, move to the far right side of the screen. Use the up and down arrow keys to select bait, Ctrl to buy, or the left arrow key to leave the shop. </p>\n<p><strong>TOOLS</strong> <br/>Development: Unity, UnityVS <br/>Graphics: GIMP, Aseprite <br/>Sound: BFXR <br/>Music: PxTone (using included voices) <br/><br/><strong>RESOURCES </strong><br/>Fonts: \"Press Start\", \"Return of Ganon\", and \"Manaspace\" by codeman38<br/>Fishing info: http://takemefishing.org/ <br/>Fishing Derby: https://archive.org/details/atari_2600_fishing_der...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b6536ab505c974e3ab563709f4f8ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dylan Wolf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
