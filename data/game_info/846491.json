The girl seemed to know her fate and told the hero never to save herself. But the hero still came to the dragon's nest. He killed many dragons with his weapon, but on the way, he found that the dragons were not the real enemies. And if you want to truly protect the world, you must kill the girls... In order to protect the girls, the hero has finally come to an end...?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers must guard the girls to defeat the dragon, unlock ten girls to trigger the \"real ending\", and lead the girls to the right reunion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player's spatial imagination is required, and the shooting trajectory of the gun is controlled by the mouse. After the bullet is shot, it will be refracted when it encounters obstacles until it hits the dragon guard. However, the bullet's energy will disappear after flying for a period of time, so it has to be refracted within a certain period of time. The dragon guards of each level are defeated, and the bullets are limited. After all the dragon guards are not defeated, the level fails. If you can get bonus stars after clearing the level, players need to use the stars to unlock the CG.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T07:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c36/c3681b47be9211fb674cf110163bfdc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Target Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Target Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
