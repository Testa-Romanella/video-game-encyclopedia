Collect characters that match the color of your bar in order to fill your multiplier for a higher score! Missing them will break your multiplier and cause the length of your bar to expand. Watch out for the green \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s, red \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s and those damn bombs, if they pierce your bar it's Game Over! Advance your gameplay to multiple color collectibles and intense enemy formation challenges. <br/><br/>Features 3 difficulty levels plus bonus challenges. Completing challenges will allow you to unlock the option to start the game in different difficulty modes. <br/><br/>Features an exquiste soundtrack by Jazz sensation Luis \"LoudMouth\" Camacho. <br/><br/>Although the game is extremely recommended for game pad use, it does have keyboard controls as well. <br/><br/>We will be releasing the game in Early Access as we continue to add increased difficulty challenges, a Linux build, Steam achievements and Steam trading cards. The game will have a low price point to appease all players on Steam...probably even just low enough for players to break even on sales of the Steam trading cards. <br/><br/>Lose yourself in the FLOBE!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9251572c8bf805cd013aeba1a6c39d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 93}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Skinny Jean Death Studios", "Porcelain Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forever Humble PDX"], "esrb_rating": null}
