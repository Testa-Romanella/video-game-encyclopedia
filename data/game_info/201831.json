Connect every destination and upgrade your most used roads.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p><p>During the game destinations spawn on the map, these destinations spawn <br/>cars that want to drive to a certain destination. To get there it will <br/>take the shortest path. Make sure you connect everything. Upgrade roads <br/>to get more capacity and speed. You lose when a car has stopped for too <br/>long. When the wait time gets to long, the background of the squares <br/>with congestion will turn red and an alarm will be played.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0left click: add/upgrade roads</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0right click: remove/downgrade roads</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Additional info</strong><br/>I did not find a lot of time this weekend and combined with the technical challenges I posed to myself in making this game, expect there to be some bugs. Car movement is pretty weird but every car will get to its destination as long as the destination is connected<strong>.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71df28b43257f9d56a005f8975530803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheOZone"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
