Gabriel can use his sword infinite powers to take GOD's enemies, or he can pick up and use the weapons of man to exact GOD's will. Do you have what it takes to be God's sword arm?</p>\n<p>A SAWD Games production.</p>\n<p>This game was in three days\u00a0made for Mini Jam 119: Heaven2, missing the initial deadline by about three hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was our second Game Jam ever, after entering 20 Second Game Jam earlier in the week.\u00a0Having never tried to complete a project in that short of a timeframe, we found that our planned scope for Divine Intervention\u00a0was too large and had to make a lot of cuts to the stage and enemy design.\u00a0Ultimately we had to rush and scramble at the end to deliver anything close to a finished project and despite the obvious issues, we are very happy with what was achieved.</p>\n<p>This jam was an incredible experience and there is a long list of lessons learned and things we would do differently next time. For example, other than the lacking difficulty and direction, we found the character's capabilities were too broad and not focused enough. We realized late in development that the platforming and dashing mechanics were\u00a0far less fun than the shooting, and drastically\u00a0increased the focus on picking up guns and shooting enemies. Next time we would be better served by focusing in on a single fun mechanic from the start rather than aiming as broad as we did.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow Keys <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Left and Right) for movement<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Up and Down) for Ladders<br/>Z = Jump<br/>X = Shoot<br/>C = Melee<br/>Mouse for clicking any buttons in game.<br/>Using your Holy Sword to defeat enemies will restore your health<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made in Godot 3.5.1</p>\n<p>Graphics:</p>\n<p>Angel Wings, Halo, Sword, Hourglass, Spikes by John Day</p>\n<p>Skull by Alex</p>\n<p>https://alexs-assets.itch.io/16x16-rpg-item-pack-2</p>\n<p>Characters, guns, projectiles, and tilesets by Craftpix</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/</p>\n<p>Heart icon by Kenney</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Explosion by Sogomn</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-3</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Heavenly Loop by isaiah658</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/heavenly-loop</p>\n<p>Drum and bass by bertsz</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/drum-and-bass</p>\n<p>Sound:</p>\n<p>Shooting sounds by Michel Baradari</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/4-projectile-launches</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Pickup sound by wobbleboxx</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/level-up-power-up-coin-get-13-sounds</p>\n<p>Font:</p>\n<p>Powerr Typeface by Fontesk</p>\n<p>https://fontesk.com/</p>\n<p>Addons:</p>\n<p>Dialogs are by Dialogic</p>\n<p>https://dialogic.coppolaemilio.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4fa4a9ab244d7408cf8ff7450e5a18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SAWD Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
