Just you, your boat, your trusty rod, and the peckish denizens of a freshwater oasis. And if that freshwater oasis happens to be the site of a nuclear meltdown thirty years ago? Well, that's fine too. A little radiation never hurt nobody.</p>\n<p>This game can be played with only one hand, your left one! Use A and D to tilt your boat left and right (the water can get a little choppy, so you don't want to fall over) and spacebar controls your line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Navigate the menu with A and D and press spacebar to select an option! Frustrated? Press R to reset your game!</p>\n<p>Made in under 72 hours for Mini Jam 76: Radiation.</p>\n<p>Yes, this game has a silly name, but no, it contains no inappropriate content whatsoever. Just a fishing game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A game by</p>\n<ul><li>Seth Burchfield</li><li>Jackson Moore</li><li>Charles Painter</li><li>Cooper Garvin</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:50:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/deab71c7630e1f4a72668dc8106d21a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Team TreeFish"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
