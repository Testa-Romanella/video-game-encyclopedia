{"id": 141022, "slug": "dashing-knight-game-jam-prototype", "name": "Dashing Knight - Game Jam Prototype", "name_original": "Dashing Knight - Game Jam Prototype", "description": "<p>Never made a game before, let alone\u00a0entered a game jam, but here's my entry for Bolt Jam #1!\u00a0For those who are unfamiliar, Bolt is an awesome visual scripting asset for Unity. Check it out:\u00a0https://ludiq.io/bolt</p>\n<p><strong>Dashing Knight sees you take the roll (pun fully intended) of the titular knight, dashing your way to glory, honour and the heart of the Princess. Well, that's the plan anyway...</strong></p>\n<p>You can dash left or right using the A or D keys, and control is entirely limited to this. No jumping, no walking, no running. Your dash is your movement, your attack, your life saver and likely the cause of you plummeting to your doom. Either button can be held to charge up a more powerful dash, but use it wisely as it consumes a larger chunk of your dash meter!</p>\n<p>This is very much an early prototype, and once you get used to the controls is a little too easy, but I plan to develop the game further, with moving hazards like wrecking balls, traps, spikes, etc. and enemies that will try to push you off a platform. I'll also be expanding a lot on the level design, introducing areas where dashing both left and right is necessary (at the moment you can complete the level by just dashing right), and\u00a0making the dash meter recharge a little slower, especially if it's completely depleted. But for now, you can enjoy my humble little prototype!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a8119eb7f9cac6be7e33e2696046ff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["victoryoverall"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
