Alone in the dark, he must follow the messages his family left behind and use their Light to find his way.</p>\n<p>This game was developed and primarily designed for Windows. I do not have a Mac to test with, so I apologize if there are any issues!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to some time zone issues we weren't able to finish the art for the second level in time. Hope you enjoy grey blocks.<br/>Thanks to Noura for staying up super late to get it done! You may notice some grey blocks sticking out in the second level - this is to provide guidance for where the platforms are in case the visuals are slightly misaligned due to a lack of testing time! If you already downloaded the game, feel free to download again and check out the visuals!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Noura El Bayrouti</li><li>Tamjid Hossain</li><li>Travis Bittel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/77449270ab72581328f255fb74e14d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tbittel6", "TamjidZ", "kickerkitten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
