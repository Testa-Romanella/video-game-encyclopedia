You can take mop, glass cleaner and rag at once, but you can hold only one bunch of trash. The countdown starts when you pick up first item. When 10 seconds elapses, you'll have to fix the electric panel on the top. To do this, you'll have to bring every control so it will collide green marks. <strong>You only have 5 seconds for it.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>After you fix the panel, you'll have 10 seconds again to do tasks. Timer stops after all tasks are finished.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Game was made using:<br/></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>Godot </em>as game engine</li><li><em>Aseprite</em> as sprite editor</li><li><em>Reaper</em> as sound editor</li></ul>\n<p><em>CONTROLS:</em></p>\n<ul><li><em>WASD</em> - Movement</li><li><em>LShift</em> - Run</li><li><em>Space </em>- Interaction</li></ul>\n<p><em>Used font:</em> Gouranga pixel<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d08640d3fcc98b069f8b5cc2d352a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Arfilish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
