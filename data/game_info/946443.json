As they investigate their surroundings, they approach a door, where they are transported to a past memory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In each memory, Rory meets a new person that shapes their identity and they will keep a memento, which they will place into the barren room, transforming it to have more color and personality. There are three different memories, each exploring a different aspect of their life.\r\n</p>\n<p>The main theoretical question driving my project is: What imprints do we leave on others? How do these experiences shape us into who we are today?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T16:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/3798d0b04d7c953b045f1347e439bffe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emiree_draws"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
