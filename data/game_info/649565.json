In the beginning, the game looks very easy but as time goes it becomes harder and harder</p>\n<p>Your cheat is infinity teleports without cooldown or something. In combination with right-click (fix cursor position) it becomes really useful. It's not direct cheats it's more like a game mechanic but in my opinion infinity teleport, it is a cheat. No matter how you got it. Through command or from the start of the game</p>\n<p>You heal when you kill enemies and enemies also drop loot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind. Choose your ship and try to stay alive till the max difficulty (you will see what is a max difficulty)</p>\n<p>It is possible but very very hard</p>\n<p>P.s.
