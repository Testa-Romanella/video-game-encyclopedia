{"id": 826727, "slug": "miku-flick02", "name": "Miku Flick/02", "name_original": "Miku Flick/02", "description": "<p>&#39;Miku Flick/02&#39;(\u30df\u30af\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30af/02) was a 2012 rhythm video game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the iOS operating systems iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. The game was a sequel to Miku Flick, released earlier that year, and a spin-off to the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games. Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. The game was released internationally on August 10, 2012, making it the second Project Diva game to be released in English. Support for the game ended on July 19, 2016.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - Wikipedia; &#39;Miku Flick/02&#39;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-26T01:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38ecdfdb79712b9eb56c50b23232f2fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 15, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Crypton Future Media"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
