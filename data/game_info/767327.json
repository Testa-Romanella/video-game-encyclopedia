{"id": 767327, "slug": "gomper", "name": "Gomper", "name_original": "Gomper", "description": "<p>A Gomper is a big ugly kaiju monster that loves to eat hamburgers. They usually have wings, but some have tentacles. The problem is, when the hamburgers run out, Gompers will eat the cute little Podlings. Play 5 different mini games to protect the wee tiny Podlings from the big evil sinister Gompers.</p>\n<p>Enter Mr. Handy\u2019s elevator room and search for ways into all the various games. You will find mini games like 10 vs 10, Burgerball, and 10 vs 100. If you can find the garage, you can take a ride in Mr. Handy\u2019s Burgermobile while listening to original music by Tigerwall Flip, Rain Station, Strip Karaoke, and Jay E Moores on the car radio. There is also a crazy fast action platformer game called The Great Burger Battle, for full on Gomper madness.\r\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s actually hard to describe and explain this game using only words, but it\u2019s a blast to play. You\u2019ll have to give it a go just to see how much fun it is to kick hamburgers at a Gomper.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play Gomper:</strong><br/>Hold the phone horizontally.<br/>Use left thumb to swipe left or right. Tap right thumb to jump.<br/>Kick hamburgers at Gompers so they will go away.<br/>If you rescue a Podling, their sparkly magic will make you temporarily indestructible,\u00a0and indestructible is good!</p>\n<p>The mini games are great practice for learning all the hamburger kicking moves, and for learning how to harness the magic of Podling Power. Then from the mini games\u00a0you can go into the battle level ready for action. The game offers addictive fast paced mini games, and a full saturation battle mode, for short or extended play. Playing Gomper will fit into any amount of spare time you feel like gaming until it has completely destroyed you.
