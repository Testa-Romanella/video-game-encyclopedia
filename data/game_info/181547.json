You see, this isn't a normal 'Press the key you see on the screen' game.\u00a0<br/>For a key to get pressed down it needs force. Lucky your finger can extrude enough force to press it down.\u00a0<br/>And of course, we can harvest this force by small 'Energy harvesters' under your keycaps. The game is made to runs on this force and so the only way for you to win is to simply collect enough energy and you do so by pressing the right key. Fail to do so can make you become saltier for every attempt. THIS is why I warn you. Only play this if you're capable of handling the stress and fastness of this game!\u00a0<br/>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>p.s<br/>If you didn't know Mike Kasprzak(creator of Ludum Dare) uses this method of harvesting power to fuel his servers! everybody who uses ldjam.com or has used. Have given him the free energy that he uses so he can run this Ludum Dare operation for free! Some day we will get him and stop this energy stealing! #EnergyFormsMatter.</p>\n<p>p.s.s<br/>This is clearly a joke, no need to panic!</p>\n<p>p.s.s.s<br/>The higher score you get, the better ^^</p>\n<p>Made by: TheSand<br/>Ludum Dare 39<br/>Theme: Running out of Power<br/>Made in 24 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95aa5ecf1b5e0cc9c4d8ccf07fa5d937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["thesand"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
