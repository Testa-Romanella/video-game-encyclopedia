{"id": 59713, "slug": "space-maze", "name": "Space Maze", "name_original": "Space Maze", "description": "In a distant future, humanity had managed to colonize different planets and expand throughout the galaxy. The galactic spaceship \"Aurora\" was on a crucial mission for <strong>the survival of the human race</strong>: to transport a cure for a deadly disease that was ravaging one of the most important colonies.<br/><br/>However, the ship encountered an unexpected obstacle: a labyrinth with deadly traps designed to prevent any ship from getting too close. The labyrinth was located in a remote sector of space, and its existence was unknown until now. Additionally, a small accident before entering the labyrinth had damaged the rudder, making it difficult to control the ship.<br/><br/>The crew of the Aurora knew they had to escape the labyrinth as soon as possible if they wanted to fulfill their mission. However, the labyrinth was a true challenge: the traps seemed to adapt to the ship's movements, and it became increasingly difficult to find an exit.<br/><br/>The captain of the ship, the fearless <strong>John Smith</strong>, needs you to take control of the situation and lead the crew to freedom. As you progress through the labyrinth, you'll encounter all sorts of traps: laser beams, force fields, automated turrets, and more.<br/><br/>However, with your help, the crew of the Aurora won't be defeated by the obstacles. Use all your skills and resources to navigate the traps and move towards the exit.<br/><br/><strong>FIND THE SECRET CODE THAT OPENS THE EXIT DOOR</strong><br/>Take the controls of the Aurora spaceship and venture into the labyrinth in search of the exit. You'll need a 4-digit code to open the exit door of the labyrinth. To complete this exit code, collect the numbers spread throughout the labyrinth in the form of capsules. Collecting all of them, even if they're not necessary for the code, will earn you points.<br/><br/><strong>EXCLUSIVE SHIP CONTROL</strong><br/>Remember, to pilot the ship correctly, you'll need to use the propulsion button to steer, as the rudder is damaged. Be cautious of traps, avoid colliding with maze walls, and don't trust other beings that will cause you to explode into a thousand pieces with a mere touch.<br/><br/><strong>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: HELP CAPSULES AND POWERUPS</strong><br/>During the journey, you'll come across different capsules that will aid you in the mission, providing everything from energy to trap deactivators. These capsules will be added to your inventory, but beware \u2013 don't use them indiscriminately, as some of them will be necessary to pass certain levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-11T02:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17d7b3c009a1699ff70ec7cbf251c43c.jpg", "website": "http://redox.ca/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 30}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redox Entertainment", "HOH5HC", "CFC Studio Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Redox Entertainment", "HOH5HC", "CFC Studio Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
