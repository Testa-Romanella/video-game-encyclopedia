{"id": 169936, "slug": "war-maker", "name": "War Maker", "name_original": "War Maker", "description": "<p>War. The world is engulfed by it. Millions have died. Millions more will starve or be killed. The global economy is in ruins. The last remaining nations on Earth have divided themselves into 2 opposing sides, each bound by ideology to conquer the other. Redania fights for law and order. Bluezbekistan fights for liberty. Many predict this will be the war to end all wars....</p>\n\n<p>..which would be terrible for business! As the newest sales recruit for Freedom and Piece, Inc., the only remaining arms dealer and defense contractor large enough to supply both sides, you have been tasked with preserving the power equilibrium between Redania and Bluezbekistan through strategic pricing and contract negotiation. You are the military industrial complex's last line of defense. Now go, prolong the war, and secure this company's financial future!</p>\n\n<p>And remember our company motto: Having freedom, means having a piece!</p>\n\n<p>Can you beat the developer's high score?</p>\n\n<p>I've uploaded an executable jar file which does not require installation. However, you need to have a recent Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed to run it. You can visit\u00a0https://www.java.com/en/\u00a0for more information. I'll also upload platform-specific installers as I build them. They should install just like any normal application, and you can follow the regular steps (Control Panel on Windows) to uninstall the game completely. I promise I'm not doing any crazy stuff to your system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1b1e2c04214459e1f05547ebf1a58ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slug_Overdose"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
