Gosh, I'm so bored.<br/><br/>But there may be hope. <br/>A tiny spark of hope, that I may find entertainment. <br/>Only with you, my fellow player, can I be entertained. <br/><strong>Entertain me!</strong></p><p><strong>Description</strong><br/>You're trapped in magic lamp. Not a desk lamp, or a standing lamp. A magic lamp, just like in that movie, Alladin. One day, while you're counting seconds, an entity appears. He wants to enslave you. Inside a prison, that is. So it's pointless for him. Anyways, you have to find him by killing everything on your path.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Mouse<br/>- LMB: move to pointer<br/>- RMB: cast at pointer<br/>Keyboard<br/>(Keyboard layout independent)<br/>- Q and E: rotate camera<br/>- A and D: switch spell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64efd618d54b86569aebb394719a477f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["pi_pi3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
