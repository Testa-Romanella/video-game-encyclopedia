To accomplish this we decided to remake one of our old, simple Unity games - <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Guano</em>. It was a game jam submission on simmer.io circa May 2019. The jam had the following rules:</p>\n<ul><li>Two colors</li><li>Minimalism</li><li>Single input</li></ul>\n<p>The game features a bird unloading his bowels onto innocent passersby below. The aim is to hit as many before your \"ammo\" runs out. The Godot 4 remake features additional game modes and updated graphics<br/></p>\n<p>If you wish to learn from this game, the source code and assets are freely available on GitHub:<br/>https://github.com/SleepingColossus/guano<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T14:05:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d1d5536b593570045426d488db3798.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sleeping Colossus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
