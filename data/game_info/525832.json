It was fun. I learned lots, made some cool music, did some fun voicelines, and made what is, in my opinion and that of my testers, a pretty fun little game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a retro-style, 2D zombie shooter, with a satisfying core gameplay loop and some fun upgrades. It's by no means a big game,\u00a0 but it's a fun little one, which I guarantee will have you trying to beat your high score, and laughing/cringing at the turret's voice lines (don't ask, just play).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pay what you want if you wanna be my best friend and support a college student, or nothing at all if you're satan himself... or, y'know, just don't wanna pay (that's fine too). If you want to have a look at how the game developed, and see some more gameplay and features, you can check out my instagram @solo.gamedev .</p>\n<p>Whether you get my game or not, I hope you have fun.</p>\n<p>Enjoy playing! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9ba99e384169f7c813d10eb45d62e730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Gamedev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
