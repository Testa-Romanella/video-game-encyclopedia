{"id": 915426, "slug": "combat-unhinged", "name": "Combat Unhinged", "name_original": "Combat Unhinged", "description": "Multiple Game Play Options:\r\n\n<ol><li><strong>Team Death Match\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>The objective of the Team Death Match game mode is to kill everyone on the opposing team, and the winner is the team that gets the most kills, or if time runs out, has the most points. A draw can also occur if two teams have the same kill count or score by the time the match ends.</li><li><strong>Free For All - </strong>The objective of the Free For All game mode is to kill the other players as many times as possible. The match may end on a kill limit or a time limit, and the winner is the player that accumulated the greatest number of kills.</li><li><strong>Capture The Flag - </strong>The objective of the Capture the Flag game mode is to capture the other teams flag. This is accomplished by standing inside the other's\u00a0 flag zone for a set time period without death. The first side that accomplishes this a certain number of  times, or scores the most captures within a designated period of time,  wins</li><li><strong>Elimination - </strong>The game mode is the classic Elimination game mode CS style where two teams have to kill every member of the enemy team (can't re-spawn until next round) in order to win,<br/>\r\n  the team that reach the maximum number of rounds wins, will be the winner of the game.</li><li><strong>Covert Point - </strong>The objective of the Covert Point/Domination mode is to own all of the  control points on the map. There are usually at least three of these  control points scattered around the map, and they are usually found in  key strategic locations. To capture a control point, a player must stand  near it for a specific time with no enemies nearby to capture it for  the player\u2019s team; the team earns <em>Tickets</em> each second for each point dominated, and the first team to reach the maximum tickets win the match.</li><li><strong>Gun Race -</strong>\u00a0The game play consists of players competing in a free-for-all-style game. As  players get more kills, the player will receive different weapons,<br/>\r\n the player wins the game by being the first to eliminate at least one  person with all the pre-defined weapons; the player is auto respawning  after getting eliminated.</li><li><strong>Kill Confirmed - </strong>Game play is similar to the Team Deathmatch mode with just one key  difference: players drop a \u201cdog tag\u201d upon being eliminated. The opposing  team has to pick up this dog tag to confirm the kill and earn a point. A  kill can also be denied if a friendly teammate collects the tag. The  game mode goal for each team is to reach a certain number of confirmed  kills.</li></ol>\r\nEarly Access. There WILL be some bugs.
