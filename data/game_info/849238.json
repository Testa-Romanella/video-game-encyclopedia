The height of the pressure is determined by the amount of blood the heart pumps and the resistance of the arteries.</p>\n\n\n<p>The BP B1 Classic is an accurate blood pressure monitor with the optimal speed and pressure control technology, Gentle+, for home blood pressure measurements.

If your results fall into this category, stick with heart-healthy habits like following a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.\r\n</p>\r\nElevated\r\n<p>Elevated blood pressure is when readings consistently range from 120-129 systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic. People with elevated blood pressure are likely to develop high blood pressure unless steps are taken to control the condition.\r\n</p>\r\nHypertension Stage 1\r\n<p>Hypertension Stage 1 is when blood pressure consistently ranges from 130-139 systolic or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic. At this stage of high blood pressure, doctors are likely to prescribe lifestyle changes and may consider adding blood pressure medication based on your risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as heart attack or stroke.\r\n</p>\r\nHypertension Stage 2\r\n<p>Hypertension Stage 2 is when blood pressure consistently ranges at 140/90 mm Hg or higher. At this stage of high blood pressure, doctors are likely to prescribe a combination of blood pressure medications and lifestyle changes.\r\n</p>\r\nHypertensive crisis\r\n<p>This stage of high blood pressure requires medical attention. If your blood pressure readings suddenly exceed 180/120 mm Hg, wait five minutes and then test your blood pressure again. If your readings are still unusually high, contact your doctor immediately. You could be experiencing a\u00a0hypertensive crisis.\r\n</p>\n<p>If your blood pressure is higher than 180/120 mm Hg and you are experiencing signs of possible organ damage such as chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness/weakness, change in vision or difficulty speaking, do not wait to see if your pressure comes down on its own.\u00a0Call 911\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T03:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/afff620e93bd9579c4f0556ded8508a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NIMAGIN interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
