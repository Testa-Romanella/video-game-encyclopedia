The game is a reboot of 1989 title, yet the developers didn&#39;t intend the game to be viewed as one.</p>\n<p>The title retells the original game&#39;s story. In the dystopian future, the best assassin of an organization called Strider is sent to eliminate the dictatorship of Grandmaster Melo who took over Earth and is now based in Kazakh City.</p>\n<p>Strider features fast combat with the element of acrobatics. Similar to the original NES game, it is an intense side-scrolling action title. The players are free to explore Kazakh City in order to obtain new abilities and equipment. There are also several pickups scattered across the level. The pickups were intended to be found and collected rather than being temporary bonuses.</p>\n<p>The game features three modes: Story Mode, Beacon Run, where the players have to reach multiple checkpoints as fast as possible, and Survival where players are put up against waves of enemies. The game features a ranking system and public leaderboards.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2012-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12ee2600684863837596c0dbb1923fca.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/strider", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 168, "owned": 3296, "beaten": 126, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 153, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 201, "ratings_count": 327, "suggestions_count": 629, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 327, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A", "Double Helix Games", "Capcom Osaka studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Capcom", "U.S. Gold"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
