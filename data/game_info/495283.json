Ever since Halloween, after that brief               but disturbing experiment with the Spiritboard, he has felt               someone, or something, calling to him. What is the significance               of the word 'Blackenrock'? Is it a name, an item, an event,               a place? </p>\n<p>This  is a free Playable Preview download of Blackenrock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First Scenes from Blackenrock, available to play for FREE; long awaited, not quite forgotten, there is much to enjoy, during troubling times. Come to Saxton, for chills and goofy fun. The harbour town is nice and empty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some will recognise Polperro as \u2018Saxton\u2019, minus a few hills and houses. It\u2019s EPIC. A folk horror, supernatural, story that explores ghosts, myths, dragons, witchcraft and... UFOs, believe it or not. But, mostly ghosts and continuing the question \u2018where or what is Saxton\u2019.</p>\n<p>Wishlist the full game coming on Steam -\u00a0Steam - The Last Crown: Blackenrock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:34:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd4d89cfbd903a3f2707f3c19a0b5990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 594, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darkling Room"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
