(fixed menu bug)</p>\n<p>You are now the nightguard of the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check the cameras, use your flashlight, and use your Freddy head/mask to get rid of those pesky-possessed animatronics. Most of the controls you can gather on your own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One thing that is worth pointing out is that you can fast switch the camera or the mask if your mouse left button is on or if you're using only the keyboard, hold A and D at the same time. It takes time to get used to it but it's the only way you can beat some animatronics on higher difficulties. good luck<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T13:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1922d7f2f6a6f1528e845bfa830834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bluebacon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
