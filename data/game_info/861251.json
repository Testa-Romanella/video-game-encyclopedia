You can return to your vehicle to get comfortable, or craft a torch.</p>\n<p>(Also, your truck, or sitting next to multiple torches\u00a0 is warm enough to heal frozen damage.)</p>\n<p>Monsters roam in the city - the damage they deal will PERMANENTLY decrease your health.</p>\n<p>Throwing a torch can stun them temporarily.\u00a0 A trap will stun them for longer, allowing you to safely kill them,\u00a0but you only have 1 reusable trap\u00a0( it can be picked back up).</p>\n\n<p>===============================================================</p>\n<p>My second game ever made in godot!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>An impactful, but easy, improvement for next time\u00a0would be polishing the main menu and the game over logic. Right now they\u00a0dont feel very\u00a0 good\u00a0 since I tend to do things\u00a0 like that\u00a0while rushing at the end - next time I think I will do those first.</p>\n<p>Also lighting in godot seems to be kind of glitchy. Torches randomly don't work and I'm not sure why.</p>\n\n<p>All art, sound, and code was made by myself during the jam\u00a0\u00a0(only thing I really reused was movement code lol)</p>\n<p>Art was made with aseprite.\u00a0I used a combination of real world sounds or playing with instruments\u00a0in a DAW (LMMS) to get the sound effects.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to KaleOverlord for providing the music! - I would have used something generic otherwise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T22:07:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/5722d1b799f9505bbaef7c6863373abf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katarne", "KaleOverlord"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
