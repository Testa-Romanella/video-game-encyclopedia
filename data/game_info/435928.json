Currently this is an engine capable of running the map.json file from the _Warped City_ demo game. The goal was for this to be the intro level and then to create new levels, and the progress is that intro level is playable and nearly complete, but there's also flying and moonwalking, so I'm not sure what else you need in a game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c7334d69fc5fd2ce6e2b188fd1a67023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["chewbranca"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
