{"id": 489254, "slug": "galactic-hero", "name": "Galactic Hero", "name_original": "Galactic Hero", "description": "<p>Galactic Hero is a shoot-em-up game that features multi-hit enemies, asteroids, weapon upgrades (tied to the leveling system), extra lives, difficulty scaling and probably more things.</p>\n<p>Galactic Hero is also my first game made in pico-8 and my first game-a-week game! So I started with the relatively simple genre of the shoot-em-up. I made the mistake of doing a lot of the adding of extra features on the final day of my week, but live and learn. Working on this project really helped me to realize, as someone who hasn't developed a game in quite some time, and even then, hardly at all, that\u00a0it isn't as daunting as I thought. A lot of features came to mind and were easily implementable. Of course, many more were not implementable due to lack to skill, but that's the whole point of game-a-week! Really enjoyed the time I\u00a0spent on it, especially on the final day.</p>\n<p>Huge shoutout to\u00a0ztiromoritz and his tutorial here:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=3948 for the starting point that got me figuring out how pico-8 works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music is not my own, I borrowed Dig Dug's game over theme since it's my favorite arcade game and I borrowed (and sped up) Super Mario Bros'\u00a01-up theme for 1-ups in this game. Other sound effects I made by drawing random shapes in pico-8 :) Hopefully with other game-a-week's I get more time to do music/sfx but hey, is what it is.</p>\n<p>I wish I had more time to add features, but the week is up so I gotta move on to the next game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145e7f6cf8a7d99d0d5fd9be5b14a008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bramble Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
