{"id": 155585, "slug": "monoship", "name": "Monoship", "name_original": "Monoship", "description": "<p>Monoship is a simple game for people who simply want to have dumb fun. The premise is simple: you're a blue ship and the red ships are trying to kill you, stay alive as long as possible. Contrary to other games of this genre, Monoship only has <strong>one button</strong>. Don't believe me because of the insane maneuvers seen in the gifs? Well try it out for yourself! It's free so why don't you.</p>\n<p>Move your mouse around and click with it to move. If you're in a pinch you can right click or double left click to teleport to your desired location. The catch? You lose 50 previous points which is equivalent to killing 10 enemies. Will your hard work evaporate while you stay alive, or would you rather die with your precious points? Find out if you decide to play (or if you don't then you'll never know :^) ).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb11edbeb440e134c4c69e683e14c0e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conradical's Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
