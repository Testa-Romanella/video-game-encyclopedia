Clear each level by killing all the AI, and then decide how you want to mod your gun. Your new barrel can point up, down, left, right, or at any angle and any position on your gun. Watch as you go from playing a simple platformer to a bullethell-esque game!</p><p>One known critical bug. If a muzzle flash from a dead AI is still present, you can't finish the level. Please restart the game.
