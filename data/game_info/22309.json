You must navigate the lizards' eggs across increasingly precarious platforms to get to the finishing bell. You can not directly control the egg however; instead you must guide it across the level by tilting and manipulating the world. <br/><br/>Inspired by old classics, Escape Lizards gives players a variety of tools to complete every level and rewards those who perfect their skills with huge replayability and automatic leaderboard integration for you and your friends.Over 100 Levels of Puzzle Platforming Fun<br/>Using <strong>either an XBOX controller or a keyboard</strong>, you'll guide your precious egg over ramps, slopes, twists and turns to get to hit the finishing bell across even the most trecherous of levels. As you improve, you'll progress through the worlds and be able to complete harder challenges and tougher puzzles. As well as simply manipulating gravity, you'll use a plethora of secondary abilities to complete levels, such as hopping and world rotations, all tutorialized. Each level also has hidden vulture eggs to knock-off on the way too, allowing you to unlock over 20 new skins for the lizard egg.<br/><br/>Whether you're looking for a new challenge or simply want a game that won't back down from turning up the heat, Escape Lizards has what you're looking for!<br/><br/><ul><li>Over 100 challenging and unique levels<br/></li><li>Original platformer mechanics<br/></li><li>Automatic Steam friend integration shows you friends' times for each level<br/></li><li>11 distinct worlds<br/></li><li>44 Steam achievements<br/></li><li>Over 20 unlockable egg skins</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae26b1a3d342b4243c24ca0d3f6fcb2.jpg", "website": "http://www.escapelizards.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Egodystonic Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Independent"], "esrb_rating": null}
