Obstacles move across the screen horizontally which you want to avoid. To get points, collect the squares that fall vertically. If you touch an obstacle, your score will appear as an alert. Press space to close it, then press space again to restart.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>This is a game I developed for a challenge I'm doing. The challenge is to develop increasingly complex games with each game I make. At first I was just limiting my pixel art and button count, but then decided I wanted to go one step further and limit my file sizes and other system related things\u00a0as well.\u00a0</p><p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/acenettner/TheCollecto</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T05:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8b3da7c761c2af9852e64ab8a67cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ace Nettner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
