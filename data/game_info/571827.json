The ENG/JPN versions are two different renditions of the story, thus requiring a separate JPN translation, emulating what happens when you try to translate something as complex as identity. My biggest inspiration is the Sega Utena game, playing it in both ENG/JPN.</p>\n<p><strong>The demo only contains the first two ENG chapters, an estimated 30-45min of playtime.</strong></p>\n<p>\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u263d\u2727\u00a0 \u00a0\u2726\u00a0 \u00a0\u2727\u263e.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550<br/></p>\n<p>Hanashiro (he/she/they) and their few remaining kin all react differently to the trauma of being immortal and witnessing the apocalypse over and over again in different cycles of reincarnation. Shiragiku is unfazed and cheery and flippant and whimsical and capricious; Shirayuri is nowhere to be found; and Hanashiro? Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Hanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>They also might be the first to kill an immortal.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65da40512902bdaa762a693f3a861494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["feyxuan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
