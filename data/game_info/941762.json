Tetra and her crew are stranded on the Lonely Island by a mysterious storm. Now she must adventure and explore across a vast open world, finding upgrades and treasures, battling monsters and rescuing survivors, to banish the evil that dwells on the island and return to the open sea.</p>\n<p>This one is absolutely zelda-y, in glorious, cartoony 3D. Can be played with WASD+mouse or XBOX-style controller. Super proud of this one. Hope you have a good time playing it. (and MAN, Godot is a good engine!)\r\n</p>\n<p>In case anyone wants to know -- the models are from the DS zelda titles (got them on Models Resource), the music is mostly from Link Between Worlds (got it on KHInsider) and the sounds are from Hyrule Warriors (Sounds Resource). The animations were made in Blender and the coding in Godot.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/018c2118d2692683619512b471e1f3c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lierniwait"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
