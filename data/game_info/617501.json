And I ran out of time to make it not only for Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>However, I think it is still a cute game.<br/></p>\n<p>There are two mistakes I know of in the jam version:</p>\n<ul><li>The stars can be collected repeatedly. Collecting them a second time doesn't do anything though.</li><li>There are more keys than locked doors. No, the extra key isn't for a secret, sorry.</li></ul>\n<p>After the jam rating period is over, maybe I can add the stuff I didn't have time to add, and fix these small problems. I will also make a browser version at some point.</p><p><strong>Instructions and Tips<br/></strong></p><p>The game has strange mechanics. Maybe you want to figure them out yourself. If not, here are some tips.</p><ul><li>Make a Kitten Connection by touching kittens without landing on the ground. Something good will usually happen.</li><li>You can air-jump when touching Burgers and DarkGemstones.</li><li>Touching Burgers and DarkGemstones will increase Combo which increases jump height and movement speed. Combo is reset when you land on ground.</li><li>Pressing Up will let you jump.</li><li>Interact with Magic Mirrors and Doors by pressing Down. Also pressing Down will pick up certain items like Keys and other great items.</li><li>If you get in a bad situation, Escape will reset the screen.</li><li>Sometimes it's difficult to proceed and you might need to think about your approach in a different way.<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8cd0c7258598a0c9177589c6a54506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sylvie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
