The end result is kinda lackluster, but I've used the jam mostly as a learning experience.</p>\n<p>First things first, the map is completely generated through PCG using Perlin Noise and the object and NPC placement is also based on that.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the NPCs have 2 different kinds of Decision Making Layers:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) The Top Layer uses an agent modelling tool \"FAtiMA-Toolkit\" to define its Macro Actions: Speak, Pray, Wander, Fight..</p>\n<p>2)The Bottom layer uses Behaviour Trees to complete the actions in a Micro level: For example, in order to Speak with the Player, the NPC must first reach them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, the main objective of this game was to try to see how an open-ended-input game could work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Player can \"say\" anything to the NPCs and would react accordingly.</p>\n<p>My idea was to include both the agent modelling tool and GPT-3 to see if it could work .</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I did not have time to complete this part and, honestly, I would've run out of budget from my GPT-3 playground account.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the moment the player writes a sentence as an answer to the NPCs but on the back-end I use a Sentence Similarity function to map it into an already available dialogue.</p>\n<p>That's it, I didn't have much time to work on this unfortunately, but I loved the challenge and next time I'll be \"readier\"</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Me: worked on this project for ~2 days</p>\n<p>The art is all made by the talented Cainos:\u00a0https://cainos.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38cc5250d9556e1149e3ddab42c89ce3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheDarkRyze"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
