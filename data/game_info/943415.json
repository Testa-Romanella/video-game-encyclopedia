For the theme, roots, I created a First-Person-Shooter game. I didn't take the meaning of Roots literally as tree/plant roots. There's another meaning in the language of computers: the Root Directory.</p>\n<p>The root is the most essential folder in any company, and once it's messed with, the computer can't function. So in my game, Root Directory Under Attack!, the player acts as Windows Firewall and has to kill the virus heading for the roots.<br/></p><p>For the Unity Class Assignment, I created a Windows 95-themed menu. The menus are disguised as Windows error messages asking the player to turn on the Firewall so it can start beating the virus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c30ddc5dcbf09d727aed8b5bc4c70b21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["undoplz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
