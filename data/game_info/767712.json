Learned how to make a turn based system, a grid system and a card and deck style system. Also enjoyed designing in isometric pixel art. Even after everything there was quite a few features I wasn't able to make and a few cards/abilities I wasn't able to finish, but I like this game so I might expand after the jam. Open to any and all suggestions, I will make a wishlist.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my boy Davy for the voice lines.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWishlist\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fog of War</li>\n<li>Multi-level, as in ground floor, second floor etc.</li>\n<li>Ability to create and destroy blocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cards</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trap Card, place a trap for the reaper</li>\n<li>Stun Card, stun the reaper for a turn</li>\n<li>Increase player range for x rounds</li>\n<li>Invisiblity, reaper cant follow for x rounds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dev ChangeLog</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Game breaks when play button is pressed in main menu</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Cursor sorting order</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Broken Icons</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Reaper Spawning issue</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Tiles remained active on new game<br/></p><p>Bugfix: Tiles remained active on Flying Staff<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T02:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27a/27ad5a17cabeba5223af5dbab695df01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["osh.studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
