Part documentary and part immersive game, Living With Jaguars explores historical and current tensions in a rural region where jaguars prey on ranchers' cattle and ranchers kill them in retaliation. Now, ranchers and jaguars must find new ways to co-exist - or risk the future of a species under threat. In this film, users explore the complex and interconnected perspectives of four key stakeholders: jaguars, ranchers, conservation researchers, and ecotourism operators. Each is vying to protect their destiny in one of the harshest and most unforgiving regions of the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e35df718e6b3d2dc1781fd1aafe37d4.jpg", "website": "http://motherboard.tv/jaguars", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Occupied VR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["VICE Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
