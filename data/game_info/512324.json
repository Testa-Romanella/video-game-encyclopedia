That game was released just three years after the specification for Chip-8 was published, so it's from around the same era. In honour of the first computer that ran Chip-8, the Cosmac VIP, and its related magazine, the VIPer, I figured it was time for a viper version of 3D Monster Maze. With a few twists of my own.</p>\n<p>3D Viper Maze is not a game with an endless supply of randomly generated mazes, like its namesake. Instead, it has handcrafted levels with vipers, coins and buttons. Your challenge, if you accept it: to find the exit in each maze, while collecting all the coins, in a series of ever more difficult puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\n<p>For more information, licensing, credits and\u00a0development notes, see Github:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Timendus/3d-viper-maze<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93a/93a829410ed51d027b9826c8d5f9cfa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Timendus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
