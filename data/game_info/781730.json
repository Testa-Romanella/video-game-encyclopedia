Or a duck?\u00a0</strong>Race against the clock to collect 10 slices of bread to feed yourself during winter! Swap ducks to unlock different abilities &amp; get that bread!!</p>\n<p>This is my submission for my second game jam (Newbies Game Jam)! The theme was\u00a0<em>minimalism</em>\u00a0&amp; optional challenges were <em>alone, you are the enemy &amp; everything is dangerous</em>. Everything (minus SFX) were made from scratch (no assets/plug-ins) using Blender/Unity/Photoshop &amp;\u00a0was completed solo!\u00a0I'm entirely self-taught &amp; have been learning for 6 weeks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game breakdown:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Minimalism:\u00a0</em>A low-poly art style &amp; basic UI elements were used throughout the game design. In addition, the game objective was kept to a simple collection system.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Alone:\u00a0</em>Even though there are two ducks to play as, they're both controlled by you (but only one at a time)! No NPC help or 2 player option available.</p>\n<p><em>You are the enemy:\u00a0</em>You're on your own collecting bread slices! The ducks do not work together toward the total slices &amp; each have their own total.</p>\n<p><em>Everything is dangerous:\u00a0</em>Well maybe not everything, but there are things that can hurt you if you're not careful!</p>\n<p><em>Controls: </em>wasd to move, space to jump, mouse for camera, left click to pick up, esc for pause/rules &amp; x to swap.</p>\n<p><em>Browser play:\u00a0</em>Click into the game window to enable mouse movement if you get stuck! Also if you're lagging a bit, make sure you have enablers on (you can do that by following these steps)!</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86 2\u00a0 playable ducks!</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86 11 unique interactions!</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86 6 interactable items!</p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86 1 minimap showing ducks &amp; ants!<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86 Enough bread to fill a bakery!<br/></p>\n<p>*Not playable on mobile devices!</p>\n<p>SFX: Animals!\u00a0&amp; Gooseberry\u00a0Platinum</p>\n<p>[Jam results: pending]\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Special mentions:\u00a0</strong>Thanks so much to Yo &amp; Shan\u00a0for beta testing for me!<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:46:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbb1673956d0e1c1fcebdb2185a864c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["steff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
