{"id": 359254, "slug": "crossniq-2", "name": "CROSSNIQ+", "name_original": "CROSSNIQ+", "description": "<strong>CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus)</strong> is a speed-focused, arcade-style puzzle game inspired by \"y2k-era\" visual design - a tribute to highly polished, small-scope Japanese games from the late 90's.<br/><br/>In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form <strong>\"crosses\" - rows and column of the same color.</strong> You can move tiles up, down, left or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.<br/><br/>In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds. Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves... or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!<br/><br/><strong>Let's Cross! Aim for THE TOP!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T19:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50e905a85e579a4961ddc6541efe4d1.jpg", "website": "http://www.crossniq.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 17, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["FUTURE MEMORY"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["FUTURE MEMORY"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
