Play through challenging levels to collect as much data in this 2D side scroller. In this game the player must weave through Firewalls, sneaky FBI agents and other pro hackers in the pursuit of the same riches as Johnny.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement- WASD or ARROW keys</p>\n<p>Jump- Space Bar</p>\n<p>**Move to the right until player is in view at the beginning of the game**</p>\n<p>**If you die, please refresh the page**</p><p>---- Design Doc -----</p><p>I decided to challenge myself here and code the entire game completely instead of using the default code through playground and it was exciting and fun but it was also a massive headache. I wanted to have a bunch of different enemy NPCs but the coding for 1 type of enemy took me 3+ hours so I decided to replicate the same enemy multiple times. I envisioned a better art style but I do not hate how it turned out. Having barely ever coded in c# before this was an interesting challenge but I'm proud of myself for pushing through the 15+ hours of coding. What I would love to add to this game include some music, more dynamic enemies, a better art style and an actual level system so that people could play more then 1 level. I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46caa4ac5202f723e82e8a8994a0c260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kareemakremi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
