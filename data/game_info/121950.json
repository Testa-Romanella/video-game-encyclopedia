Legends say a chest of gold is hidden within. It's up to you to navigate the temple, avoiding pitfalls along the way. You'll leave rich or die trying.</p>\n<p>.... unless you'd just prefer go home. That's a valid option too.<br/></p>\n<p>Easy Mode: No side quest, minimal ways to lose. Enjoy the simplest way to get around the temple.</p>\n<p>Medium Mode: A side quest is added to the mix (how many memories can you find?), as well as a splash of randomized danger to keep you on your toes.</p>\n<p>Hard Mode: Coming soon. The temple will be bigger and more treacherous. Give me your input on the game and you might just help shape it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e0029b78b501d4c704e45be362233b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonathanfournier"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
