He then gets some info about the heated World War 4 in action. Crashing into the current time damaged his car so he needs to attach his time warper to a new fast car. Else, he risks being bombed and erased out of existence.<br/></p>\n<p>Gazing around, he noticed a dealership just around the corner. A soldier stationed at the dealership gives some information on how to access the dealership.\r\n</p>\n<p>Upon entry, the traveler sees a car that matches his requirement and decides to test drive. While attempting to test drive, the traveler got hindered by some cones, they looked invasive to him, given they are of the same stripe and color as the Cyborg Cops Institute uniforms.\r\n</p>\n<p>He has to quickly get rid of them. Using his psychic abilities, he furiously moves the cones from his way and drives to infinity while attaching his time warper to the car.
