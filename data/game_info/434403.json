You are the young streamer girl Doppel, who in pursuit of popularity visited an abandoned shopping mall. Keep your stream alive, raise view count and try not to die under mysterious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, things took way more time than we thought, so we had to cut off even some of the finished content. As a result, it\u2019s just a very basic prototype with a few minutes of gameplay. It still features some graphics, music, animations, jokes and (we hope) gives a gist of what to expect from the full version! Please tell us what you think!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement \u2014 A/D</p>\n<p>Right Click to switch camera, then Left Click to comment on a thing (~6 objects to comment on for now)</p>\n<p>Commenting on different objects changes the number of viewers.
