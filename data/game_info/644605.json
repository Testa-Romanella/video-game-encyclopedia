Some may be the waning cries of stars whose deaths have been delivered, though your distance only allows you to see them in the prime of their youth. Others could potentially be the slow, steady blinking of other ships who have similarly faced the odds and pervailed in some way or another. Still others may be completely alien. Whether these foreign entities have any concept, or even will to understand, such Godian concepts as morality or empathy is unknown. Whatever the case may be, you knew upon your departure that this was a very real risk. A risk made physically apparent when you heard the teleporters activate without hearing a transmission request. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use WASD to move and Space to shoot any rockets you've picked up. Rockets can be shot at aliens onboard or in front of the ship, as long as you have a direct line of sight. Collecting stars grants you points. Points grant you a greater high score when you die. High scores grant you the ability to gloat!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a project coming from one who is very much a beginner for a beginner's circle jam, but I'll admit this is pretty bad even by those standards. Some might even say non-functional.
