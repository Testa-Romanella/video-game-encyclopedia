None of us are artists!</p>\n<p>This demo is a prototype polished enough that someone may want to play it a few times. We are unsure about the future of the project but if you have something to say let us know in the comments!</p>\n<p>It is intended to be played online with friends though you can play by yourself. Controls are temporarily on the screen when you start the game and then are available in the pause (Esc) menu.</p>\r\nA controller is required to play!\r\n<p>Xbox and PS4 controllers work fine. Most Logitech work.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to carry the bomb to the enemy communications tower 3 times. The bases are defended by destructible walls and turrets.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Bill - Programming<br/>Brian - Programming and Tech Lead (also sometimes Project Lead!)<br/>Aaron - Design, Level Design +\u00a0\"Art\", Testing, Baby Programming, Project Lead</p>\n<p>Inspired by Return Fire and Twisted Metal<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:36:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ae/3ae0092eb59542c42e6af9dad4ce95b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bill", "Brian Nielsen", "satellitecore"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
