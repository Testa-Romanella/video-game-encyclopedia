This is a small demo which showcases gameplay and mechanics which I had planned in a Game Design Document. The point of this project was to start from the Ideation Process, Create a GDD, Make a Paper Prototype and then create that game idea in a Game Engine.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>End Days is a Tower Defence game set in the distant future where Nature as turnt on Humanity and they are at war with eachother. This Prototype shows a slice of what the final game could look like.\u00a0</p><p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></p><p>Development started with the Ideation Process where I would try different ways to generate ideas andthen turn the idea I liked the most into a Game Design Document. Once I had done that I then created a Paper Prototype to test my idea and to see if it worked. After this I began development on the Digital Version, you can check out my Devlogs below to see the development of the Prototype.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c0653d902594098e90045795553ff486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BRADLEY O'NEILL"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
