His climb seems impossible, but during his climb he encounters many seemingly hidden objects that aid his ascent: it shows that even in the seemingly most inhospitable medium such as rock, life can blossom from the smallest invisible crack and opportunity is everywhere for those who care to take a closer look!<br/></p>\n<p>Creators: Sharayar, Joshua, Jorge, Tony, Nahee Jamie</p>\n<p>Assets: Artwork done by\u00a0Joshua and Jamie.
