They focus on increasing their Attack Bonus and landing more critical hits in combat.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The <strong>Street Warrior</strong> leans more towards combat ability over skill knowledge. They focus on dealing devastating melee blows and mitigating damage in combat.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The <strong>Techhead</strong> leans more towards skill knowledge over combat ability.

Will you shoot a burst of bullets, administer medical aid, throw some grenades, or pop a few street drugs? The choice is yours.</p>\n<p><strong>IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE \"HIGH TECH, LOW LIFE\" FUTURE</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Explore the open world districts of New Avalon, in all of their beauty and cruelty. Each district has its own unique aspects and encounters setting them apart from each other. There are at least 8 planned in the final release. The final number of districts is subject to change.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Join or destroy factions. Lay waste to gangs, become a member of organized crime, or ignore them altogether.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Unique drug system consisting of over 20 different street, pharmaceutical, and electronic drugs, each with levels of positive and negative effects. The final number of drugs is subject to change.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Sample the local cuisine. Consume food and alcohol, for minor healing and attribute bonuses. (The drink shown is Rob's Painkiller.

Use calibers from .22LR to the mighty .50 BMG. All of the game's firearms have their counterparts in real life (some are prototypes, like the WSG2000) and use hand drawn sprite-work by me. Most are complete, but only some are in the demo.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Equip over 50 unique pieces of cyberware, including cyberlimbs, cyberoptics, cyberweapons, neuralware, chipware, co-processors, implants, and bioware.
