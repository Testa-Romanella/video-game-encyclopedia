(Parity64)", "description": "<p>This is just a small game I made in RPG maker XP to learn how to use the engine. I plan on making better full games in the future. This game's setting is based on my concept art for a specific area in a game I want to make, a Yume Nikki inspired game. There isnt really much to do here, as theres only 3 rooms, but I hope that this will lead to me being able to make an actually good game in the future. Consider this the demo for my upcoming project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T20:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/666c27d470607c469c4860e163dac8e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parity64"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
