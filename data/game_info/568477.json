Due to the difficulty of the game, you will die many times, but don't worry, you will respawn where you died\u00a0right away! But due to a failure in the code, the level will not be the same...\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, this failure will make you progress! and to progress you will need to die, so you must fail to progress! and if you fail to fail, you will not progress, so failing to fail is a fail!\u00a0</p>\n<p>And I can continue for hours but I think I wrote too much: 75% of the text is filler; so I failed in writing a description of this game... But since this game is about failing, I would fail to communicate the meaning of this game if I had not failed in a way or an other. So, no matter what I do,\u00a0I would fail and succeed in the same time...</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy the game!</p><p>--edit--</p><p>the sources for the sound effects are at the end of the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51e85d557675422995f10e3ff52f8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["elimera"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
