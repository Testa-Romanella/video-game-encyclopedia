Rock Paper Scissors Shoot! is a funnily enough a Rock Paper Scissors game. It has cartoon style art and sound effects and a very simple interface. I made it for the weekly game jam on itch.io. It took two days of inconsistent work, about six hours total plus the time it has taken to tweak things and get it formatted for different platforms.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/8841342778394ed6c8472351b5d56e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["autistmouse"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
