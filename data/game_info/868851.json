I also set up a few items pickups such as ammo, health, food, water and oxygen and added sound to complement these assets on pickup and the bar associated count will be replenished.\u00a0 I learned a lot working on this project and really the process of putting it all together.\u00a0 The project was made in Unity.\u00a0 I found the scripting the most challenging especially in regards to the oxygen meter only operating in the water and meeting the required conditions.\u00a0 Inspiration was from games like DayZ, Scum, Subnautica and Dead Poly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T11:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89f/89fa122ac18a79fc1c96ff96857df110.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke McCarron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
