{"id": 414057, "slug": "choose-your-shoes", "name": "Choose your shoes!", "name_original": "Choose your shoes!", "description": "<p><em>\"Choose your shoes!</em>\" is a game, where you need to put yourself in someone else's shoes and answer some yes/no questions. You can switch between two characters by clicking on their shoes. To answer a question<strong> as </strong><strong>'yes' swipe right, as 'no' swipe left</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0If you guess right, the label changes color\u00a0to green, if not, to red. You can also use the toggles as notes to help yourself remember about the characters' personalities.</p>\n\n<p>The empathy you achieve at the end of the game is calculated according to my and my partners' answers, relatively how hard was to answer the question - yes, the shoes are also ours respectively :) Therefore, if you guess wrong something that was so easy/obvious for them to answer you lose more points. In the same way, if you guess right something not to decide for them, you gain more points.</p>\n<p>It is develop mainly for mobile, but you can try also in the browser and Windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/7706a2d650b8ee58130f048c0937e46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Kusaihana"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
