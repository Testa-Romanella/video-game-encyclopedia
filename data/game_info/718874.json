The idea was to adapt a comic into an action/car racing video game.</p>\n<p>You are racing against AI and aim to finish first and/or destroy your ennemies (like a mario kart), by pressing <strong>space\u00a0</strong>you will get out of the vehicle and be able to shoot at ennemies or grapple into their cars. While you are out of the vehicle an AI is driving for you (the idea at first was that this gameplay could evolve into a coop game). When you grapple into others cars you will take control of it (can be usefull if you own car is about to be destroyed).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T06:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/21690d40e3e846cd229d0926de8035ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zac"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
