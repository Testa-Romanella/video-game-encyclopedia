You are equipped with your trusty sword which you use to defeat enemies and destroy objects like vases to collect coins.</p>\n<p>Coins can be used to unlock additional characters to play with. Characters have no effect on the game and are purely cosmetic only. However, each character has a unique back story and lore which is another incentive for you to unlock them. You aim to survive as long as you can and see what great distances you\u2019ve traveled. Your distance is saved online for you to compare with other players.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Jump = space<br/>Attack = m<br/></p>\n<p>The game should run perfectly on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Please forgive me for the odd resolution, but since this game was designed and built from the ground up with mobile in mind, the UI and everything becomes odd when trying to build for regular 16:9 displays.</p>\r\nCredits:<p>The guys at Code Squirrels for helping with ideas and feedback on issues I had.<br/>Maulwurf93 for helping with some of the code and helping me debug some issues.<br/>Miss\u00a0Cosmos for providing the lore for the Vampire character</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T16:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36a/36a97240c93d94dfd2c23842848c122f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dekiru_dev", "OdinsRavenDev"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
