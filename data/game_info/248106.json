Featuring placeholder graphics, three sets of choices, and 27 different outcomes, some more interesting and/or varied than others.</p>\n<p><em>This game was developed in five days for the Ren'Py Jam during September 2018. The aim was to explore and get familiar with Ren'Py basics, create something that is finished, and keep polish as no low priority as possible. Hence, it's very rough around the edges, but still fully playable.</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8ed3e605bf5fff68f4a65ee138aa8aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["wilderwhits"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
