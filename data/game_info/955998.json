Your goal is to scare off the current inhabitant of the house in the forest named Leonardo.

Unfortunately I didn't manage to finish the game, but upon working on it for a couple of more hours, I found that it felt more like a tech demo instead of a game, if that makes sense. The fun factor isn't really in the game, so I just finished a game loop and called it \"done\".\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T10:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a7b1e33ac5355ab9a28f3f47a825ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PakPakGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
