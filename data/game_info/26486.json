Though this is the third \n      installment in the series, the story takes place between the first and \n      second installments. Players can choose from 12 samurai seeking to \n      defeat Zankuro Minazuki. Along with minor upgrades from the last \n      version, such as the ability to press buttons to fill your rage gauge \n      and the ability to defend in midair, you can also select from slash and \n      bust personality types for each character. Each type has its own set of \n      special moves you can take advantage of, effectively doubling the amount \n      of characters you can play.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
