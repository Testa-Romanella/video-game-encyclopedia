{"id": 16552, "slug": "dead-bits", "name": "Dead Bits", "name_original": "Dead Bits", "description": "<p>In Dead Bits, everything, from the environment to enemies, is entirely made of cubes. The game is intentionally made with extremely minimalistic graphics and simplest textures, and is set to dubstep music. Visually, Dead Bits somewhat reminds Minecraft, but gameplay-wise, it\u2019s a combination of the first-person shooter with platforming elements. <br />\nThe protagonist named Quilly was kidnapped by the aliens led by Quanton. Quilly has to complete a series of tests for Quanton before he is released. The \u201ctests\u201d actually consist of short levels in which you fight zombies and giant humanoid robots made of boxes. The protagonist starts each level armed with either a gun, an iron stick, or even nothing at all at some levels where you have to find the weapons yourself. Most levels are set on the platforms floating in the middle of nowhere, though there\u2019s also a claustrophobic corridor level with limited visibility. Outside of the cutscenes, there\u2019s no character model. Quilly has no visible legs and casts no shadow, which makes navigating the platforms way more difficult than one might expect. Each Quilly\u2019s death is followed by a cutscene that cannot be skipped.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e170c8d8082a31897e38cfd3cbd9c1e6.jpg", "website": "http://www.microblastgames.com/", "rating": 1.71, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 67, "owned": 1999, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 38}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 118, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 120, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Microblast Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microblast Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
