I'm learning Unity and going through a course to help with that. This is one of our projects and just wanted to show the progress I'm making.<br/><br/>NOTE: If you find any bugs let me know! I found three really major ones as I was uploading the file. I'm sure there are more that I haven't seen and I'd like to learn from it. I'm also not sure how it will work on Linux and Mac so if you have those let me know as well. Interested to see if it plays the same or has issues I need to look into.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64ef5d0c2198e0a3d1625a688cff4d0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["You're A Kitty!
