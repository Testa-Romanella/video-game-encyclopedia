But I just started working with Unity and pixel arts and it was as difficult as everything at the beginning.</p>\n<p>But somehow I managed it and I am quite proud of what's the result.</p>\n<p>I would love to make more games and therefore I really appreciate every kind of <strong>critics and/or feedback</strong> that you have for me! (just send E-Mail to <em>ToniDevGames@gmx.de</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Since I never actually planned to make that short game available online I did not really saved any links to sounds or pictures I used in my game - which I made not by myself. After finishing the game I started to search for every single file but could not re-find anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>So if anyone recognizes his or her sounds (found them all on freesounds.org) please just write an E-Mail and\u00a0I will immediately mention you in the credits.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a6988f192da78d31e2ba44da249fa559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ToniDevGames"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
