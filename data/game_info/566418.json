{"id": 566418, "slug": "painite", "name": "Painite", "name_original": "Painite", "description": "<p>Welcome to Painite! This is a game still in development, I'll be adding more cards, characters and additional features over time.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>TUTORIAL</p>\n<p>You start the game with 30 cards and a character with a unique hero power. Playing each card costs a certain amount of mana, and each player starts with 1 mana and receives an extra mana each turn. Hero powers cost 2 mana. Each character starts with 50 health. Whichever character reaches 0 health first, their owner loses the game. Whoever gets to start first, the game awards his opponent with a bonus mana card.</p>\n<p>Characters:</p>\n<p>- Elf (Character power: Deal 2 damage to the enemy character.)</p>\n<p>- Monk (Character power: Deal 2 damage to your character and draw a card.)</p>\n<p>- Knight (Character power: Heal your character by 1.)</p>\n<p>You can play spells or creature cards.\u00a0Spells instantly activate their effect, whereas creatures are placed on the table, waiting for the next turn to be able to attack. Each creature has their own attack and health points, and can only attack once. Some creatures have special \"creature effects\" that can be triggered after various actions.</p>\n<p>Creature Effects:</p>\n<p>Battlecry: Activated when you play the card (place it on the table).</p>\n<p>Deathrattle: Activated when the creature dies.</p>\n<p>Charge: Creatures that have charge can instantly attack (rather than waiting for the next turn).</p>\n<p>Windfury: These creatures can attack twice each turn.</p>\n<p>Some creatures can also make different impacts at the end of each turn.</p>\n\n<p>Deck Builder:</p>\n<p>Unless you build your own deck and select the character you want to play (and save it), you'll be playing with a default character and a default deck. When building a deck, you can only pick the same card for three times. You need to select a character and\u00a0have exactly 30 cards in your deck to be able to save your deck and play with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T09:25:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e0b6520f3801f391ab168c0c3a92ec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dcankara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
