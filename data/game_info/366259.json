Only problem is...one group has no idea who is on their team, and the other group knows who everyone is, but will lie about what side they're on. Which group will be your group? And if you're not the Secret Who, will you be able to find out who is before it's too late?<br/><br/>It is highly recommended you play this with your friends/family in person or remotely via Skype or your preferred method for video conferencing. It's much easier to find a liar when you can look them in the eyes.<br/><br/>Also, you can chat with the other player in the chat room.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T03:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b5fc527cdf95e5126d0e406c6eeb4ee.jpg", "website": "https://secretwho.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Christopher A Serra"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Christopher A Serra"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
