Choose whether you think they're a character from Star Wars or a member of the US Republican party. Can you achieve the rank of President Space Wizard?</p>\n<p>I'm not gonna record a commentary vid for this one because there's really not much to say! A poster on a forum I frequent, balistic (thanks Brian!) made the observation that a lot of Republicans have names that sound like Star Wars characters, so I did a thing! This quiz is really totally unfair for Star Wars fans because it only features super obscure one-off characters I found on Wookiepedia, but if you're a US politics nerd, you might do ok.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1574dd95d8b47a9ebca69d56ce72daae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["starsoft games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
