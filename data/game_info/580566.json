After multiple playthroughs I think it isn't too broken and I am hoping people actually find exploits I never thought of :)</p>\n<p>I had to cut a lot of corners versus the original spec but hey, it's the first real project I've ever released, so...</p>\n\n<p>No scripts, but\u00a03rd party graphics and music\u00a0assets were used</p>\n<p>Credits to: BitbyBitBert, YujiBoy, LuckyCasette, TheMightyPalm,\u00a0SorceressGameLab, somepx</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/03059a2bac5e055b468c1059df16753d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mooglerampage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
