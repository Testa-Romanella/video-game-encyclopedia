Since Forth programs won't work without the Forth interpreter itself, I suggest these two options tu run the game:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a01) Run VICE emulator and load the \"snake.vsf\" snapshot file. Type \"snake\" (without quotes) and press ENTER to start playing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a02) Run DurexForth in VICE emulator or real C64.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Type \"include compat\" (without quotes) then ENTER.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Type \"include gfx\"\u00a0(without quotes) then ENTER.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Copy-paste or type in the source code. Then again, type \"snake\" (without quotes) and press ENTER.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a03) Have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe51847fe03a6051f5e621cbb54b3ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kempston"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
