{"id": 770957, "slug": "reckless-toboozy", "name": "Reckless (toboozy)", "name_original": "Reckless (toboozy)", "description": "<p>Made for one of my uni assignments.<br/></p>\n<p>\"Reckless is set on a futuristic battlefield with alien hordes who\u2019ve come to invade your home planet. Take control of a mortally wounded barbarian soldier using their last moments to cause as much carnage as possible. Too angry to die, you must keep your constantly depleting rage meter from reaching zero by defeating enemies in quick succession.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player can move, shoot, dash, whirlwind, and drag/throw enemies to achieve this. Shooting is the most reliable and safe method of dealing damage but causes significant screen shake, making evasive manoeuvres more difficult. Dashing provides a burst of speed in an orthogonal direction, however, momentarily removes control from the player, committing them to their decision. The whirlwind attack expends rage to hit enemies surrounding the player, knocking them backwards and destroying bullets \u2013 useful for when surrounded. The drag/throw allows smaller enemies to be picked up and thrown at larger enemies for huge amounts of damage, however, whilst dragging, increases the rate which the rage meter depletes and has the potential to miss.</p>\n<p>Enemies shoot back at the player in unique patterns, often requiring evasive manoeuvres from the player to avoid taking damage. If the player is hit by a projectile, their rage meter instantly decreases depending on the size of the projectile. The player must use a combination of all actions to quickly and precisely overcome the enemies that threaten to overwhelm them.\"<br/><br/>ASSETS USED</p><p>Font used:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/defused.font\r\n</p>\n<p>Background image:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://hdqwalls.com/pixel-distortion-4k-wallpaper\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound effects:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.gamemasteraudio.com/product/gun-sound-pack/\r\n</p>\n<p>Music (check this guy out if you're a game dev - they're fantastic):\r\n</p>\n<p>https://davidkbd.itch.io/eternity-metal-scfi-music-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T16:03:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05d/05dcb38fd6172c481853ea983f32f1f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["toboozy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
