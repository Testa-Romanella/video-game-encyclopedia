About the GameWe began this project as we were interested in the idea of a monster park. Perhaps the monsters would eat the guests, and the guests, unable to find food, would starve in the park... and so on. We realized what a fun idea this could be, so we continued full steam ahead. Game Content MonstersMonsters are at the core of this game. You'll need to find them, place them in habitats, and train them. Monsters must also be fed and be provided with a suitable environment according to their individual characteristics. You also have various methods to improve the mood of your monsters, including pairing them up with a partner of any gender. (If monsters get upset, the park might be in trouble!)Regular GuestsGuests are the gods of the park. The park's business model simply wouldn't work without their money! You'll need to provide guests with restaurants, concession stands, souvenir shops, and even toilets to create an unforgettable experience.<br/>Guests, of course, have their own satisfaction levels which need to be carefully monitored. Show them a highly-rated monster or some unique monster behavior to make them happy! Try to improve guests' moods by adjusting prices, building carnival games, installing photo booths, and more. (While these methods might earn you more money and make your guests happier, they may also annoy your monsters. Be careful!) Extremely satisfied guests might just walk out of your park with an armful of souvenirs! Special GuestsWhen the park meets certain conditions, special guests including VIPs, politicians, goblins (thieves?), and poachers will make an appearance. You'll need to take special care of these guests and determine their survival. Decide the future of the park! StaffSpending more money on employees is always a smart choice, as long as you can afford to pay their salary at the end of the month. Don't forget that they're counting on you to provide a safe work environment! Staff are split into trainers and security charged with changing monsters' food and water, repairing park facilities, healing sick monsters, and catching high-risk monsters outside of the park's fences.ContactTwitter: @MonsterSafari<br/><br/>Facebook: @MonsterSafariHD<br/>Press contact: indie@xindong.com", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67eb6382204127090a6aa18878920d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SmallOne Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["X.D.
