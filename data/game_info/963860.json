Just days before, there was a severe virus outbreak, resulting in most of the citizens becoming mindless zombies bent on devouring human flesh. Fortunately, these zombies are averse to bright lights! Utilize your flashlight to deter zombies and flock to street lamps and other bright light sources to stay safe from the hoard! Use your various weapons and tools to collect the necessary supplies, contact the National Guard, and escape from the island! But be cautious, as zombies are very curious and will investigate noises such as loud footsteps and gunshots.<h3>So what exactly is this game?</h3> Epicenter VR is based on a project spawned out of a flat-screen game of the same name. The original was fairly small in scope and was built in a month for a college course. After about a year I decided to port everything to VR! I believe in the future or VR gaming and want to see more developers create interesting experiences for the platform. <br/><br/><strong>And here we are!</strong> I will bring future updates as needed, fixing bugs and adding new features. The game is mostly complete as I envisioned but as I see how players react to it, I'm sure I will have more to do! More QOL, weapons, etc are all on the table regarding future updates.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-24T03:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e2ea6ded7bc7006b0f5d21492eb5ee8.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/FiveVoltGames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FiveVolt Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FiveVolt Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
