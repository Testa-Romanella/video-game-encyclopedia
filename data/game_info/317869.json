Shapes are 'printed' with the A button and the floor is cleared without printing by pressing the Y button.<br/><br/>Printing the target and bonus shapes yield a higher score.</p>\n<p>If the Tetris queue runs dry,\u00a0 the first player will start taking damage.</p>\n<p>Printing non Tetris shapes is allowed, but will penalize your score.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Player Two</strong></p>\n<p>The second player plays Tetris with pretty standard Tetris rules.</p>\n<p>Move around with the left thumbstick or the D-Pad. Drop a block with the A button and rotate a piece with the X and B buttons.</p>\n<p>The Tetris player should try and play as fast as possible to empty the queue. Once the queue is empty, the first player will start taking damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Jeremy de Reuck - Programming</p>\n<p>Nadia de Reuck - Art</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used</strong></p>\n<p>Modular RPG Heroes Polyart</p>\n<p>Mega Game Music Collection<br/></p>\n<p>Universal Sound FX<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Todo</strong></p>\n<p>We would still like to add some finishing touches, especially with regard to player feedback and general polish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:50:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/141/1413ad24c8fcd56ae8b9c015117d2fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelJerry"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
