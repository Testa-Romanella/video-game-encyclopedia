It's a trap...</p>\n<p>You are a test subject, stuck in Simons test facility.\u00a0Simon will decieve you and try to make you die in every way possible. <br/>Only way to escape from the facility: <strong>Don't listen.</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the WOWIE game jam 3.0 with the theme \"Failure is Progress\". https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-3</p>\n<p>We thought that failing Simons commands was fitting to the theme.<br/>Most assets and code was made during the jam, but some code was recycled and used to save time.</p>\n<p>All sound effects have been made from scratch in the last 2 days using only household items like balloons, spatula, Styrofoam, voice, etc.\u00a0&amp; Synthesis. The electric sounds are coil recordings which is my own previous work. DAW used for editing and recording sound effects: Reaper.
