The people then brought back to \n      life Rygar, a legendary warrior, in order to fight to save the Human \n      race. Armed with a weapon which extends out (Diskarmor), you'll also \n      make full use of your jumping abilities to venture through and clear all \n      27 stages. Making its appearance in arcades in 1986 as a side-scrolling \n      action game, the game received high acclaim for its beautifully rendered \n      graphics, such as a setting sun and waterfalls. There are also many \n      bonus features such as collecting the 5 Powers of Indra to obtain \n      special bonuses or gaining 1,000,000 bonus points for finding hidden \n      items (Indra\u2019s Book of Secrets). Aside from those, the number of lives \n      and the difficulty settings can be altered.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
