I have only just started to learn coding, graphics and Unity two weeks ago and gave myself the challenge of competing in Ludum Dare 46 for a bit of fun and a goal(I've watched YouTube videos on it for years). <br/><br/>I present Sunflower Strife! A game where you have to keep the Sunflower alive at all costs, by ensuring it has enough water to grow and thrive. There is but one problem! Flames are encroaching all around and are making the temperature rise!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Shoot the flames to douse them, but make sure to keep the Sunflower well saturated to see it grow to maturity!</p>\n<p>Controls: Move mouse right/left to aim and Left Mouse Button to spray. Escape to quit.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6604094bbe9ba906b88ed9d3b6d754ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamiAC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
