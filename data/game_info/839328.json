Unfortunately there is no sound, just imagine some fantastic Warioware theme music playing in the background.</p><p>We came up with a basic micro game heavily inspired by Warioware micro games.</p><p>The finished product is not as polished as we wanted it to be but that is the nature of game jams!</p><p>\u00a0If we had another day for the game jam, we have the sprites for keeping score and adding a bit more character to some of the objects in the game. We'd also make the game loop back to the start\u00a0 instead of ending on a white screen with no indication of how you did...</p><p>Some of the sprites needed to be scaled more than we prepared for, this could easily be fixed with an extra bit of time.</p><p>We also would have liked to add a few more microgames into it, but I suppose the small nature of it helped us complete the finish game in under 60 seconds diversifier!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f84043e75a80fe23ae530bc9e920265.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ielHouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
