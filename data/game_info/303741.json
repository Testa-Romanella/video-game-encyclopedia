The aim of the game is to last as long as you can in a falling apart space ship, where the only person on board is you, an android. So you must go fix areas where sparks are being emitted from. Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Also, be careful as the gravity systems are failing!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there was a small cut-scene when you clicked play but when I uploaded it, it didn't appear but that is why there is a blue blank screen anyway.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c5441a12aae012b957f23b8822436af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Flag"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
