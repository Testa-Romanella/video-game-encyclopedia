The game-play emphasize fast-paced action remnant to that of classic shooters. Players will face multiple enemies, objectives and challenges through multiple levels set over four distinctive environments and each level features at least one unique boss encounter.<h3>Back Story</h3><br/>In ancient times the foundations of civilization were seeded by the guild of Magus. Scholars of the guild, known as the wizards of Magus, studied the arcane of magic in the fields of alchemy, astronomy and astrology. Only through decades of study could the most devoted wizards master the arts of magic. These masters were called the Sortiari.<br/><br/>Wizards casted spells that would both aid in the advancement of civilization as well as unleash massive destruction upon ancient battlefields. Wielding such power however came at a great personal cost. Casting magic would rapidly drain the user's life force causing accelerated ageing.<br/><br/>Frustrated by his own dwindling live force, a Sortiari known as Kronos turned to forbidden techniques to gain immortality. Freed from the shackles of time Kronos indulged in magic to a dangerous extent and became consumed by an ever growing desire to shape the world to his every whim.<br/><br/>For centuries Kronos plagued the ancient world turning all manner of creatures into monstrous beings. After aeons of war and unable to defeat Kronos, the wizards of Magus finally managed to entrap him in a rift crafted within the very fabric of time and space.<br/><br/>Fearing that history would inevitably repeat itself the guild of Magus was disbanded and their accumulated knowledge was sealed away. Eventually all remnants of their existence was reduced to nothing more than myth and legend.<h3>Setting</h3><br/>In the not too distant future advancement in science and technology led to the development of the hyperspace drive. Hyperspace drives create rifts through time-space allowing access to a time altered dimension known as hyperspace allowing for faster than light travel. Together with advanced cryopreservation techniques, this gave rise to a new era of deep space exploration.<br/><br/>It was however discovered that the cryostasis procedures that deep space astronauts were subjected to caused severe mental stress. Combined with the extended periods of isolation associated with deep space travel this led to a massive rise in incidents associated with dementia and other mental afflictions.<br/><br/>In order to maintain safety aboard deep-space vessels, a new advanced type of artificially intelligent android was developed. These androids known as AIVO units are unaffected by the <br/><br/>Banished and entrapped in a time sphere Kronos is adrift in a time altered dimension. Each time a hyperspace drive creates a rift through time-space it triggers an anomaly within  Kronos\u2019s time sphere. Sensing these anomalies Kronos conjured a spell allowing him to align the position of his time sphere with that of the rift causing such an anomaly.<br/><br/>The Phlegethon is in hyperspace nearing the planet S3-15P778 as its final waypoint in a three-year mining operation. As the hyperspace drive opens a time rift in order to drop from hyperspace Kronos senses this anomaly and casts his dimensional alignment spell. As the Phlegethon emerges from hyperspace the dimensional alignment spell bends time and space and the ship collides with Kronos\u2019s time sphere. The ship\u2019s control systems are heavily damaged by the impact, and the crew awake from cryostasis to find that only the basic life support systems are active. They immediately scurry to try and get backup power and control systems online.<br/><br/>Meanwhile during the collision Kronos manages to board the Phlegethon and he starts transforming crew members into mythological creatures to serve as his minions. Those who manage to escape the transformation are hunted down and slaughtered by these creatures.<br/><br/>Due to system damages sustained during the impact, AIVO-D13 the AIVO unit aboard the Phlegethon remained unactivated. Amongst the chaos a crew member manages to bring the backup systems online, and AIVO-D13 is finally activated.<br/><br/>In order to prevent this affliction from possibly spreading to other systems, AIVO-D13 sets out to find and contain the source before he can signal for assistance. He starts battling his way through the service and maintenance quarters toward the control deck.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T04:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a75d025307e62f8eb4e3638658491e1.jpg", "website": "https://www.axongames.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axon Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Axon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
