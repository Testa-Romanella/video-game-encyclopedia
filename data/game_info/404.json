{"id": 404, "slug": "uncanny-valley", "name": "Uncanny Valley", "name_original": "Uncanny Valley", "description": "<p>Uncanny Valley is an indie horror game about insanity and supernatural.</p>\n<h3>Style and atmosphere</h3>\n<p>Uncanny Valley is made in the simple 2D pixel-art style with no face animations. Despite its limitations, the game recreates the gloomy atmosphere of supernatural thrillers like Silent Hill games and such TV series as Twin Peaks and Stranger Things. It is set in the cold, rainy area during autumn and winter. Uncanny Valley features dark, claustrophobic levels and is set to creepy horror synth / dark ambient music.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of Uncanny Valley is nonlinear and strongly depends on the player&#39;s choices. The game itself recommends the player to replay it several times to discover all possible plotlines and endings.</p>\n<p>The protagonist is Tom, a security guard at a secret facility. His only colleagues are Buck, an obese guard, and Eve, a young caretaker who is Tom&#39;s love interest. His mental health is far from perfect, as Tom suffers from narcolepsy. He often falls asleep and loses the edge between reality and fantasy. Some of the events in the game are actually the main character&#39;s illusions and dreams.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player leads Tom as he does his daily watchman&#39;s job. By night, he has to patrol the secret research facility, eventually learning its dark secrets. Occasionally, Tom will fall into his nightmares and have to run away from the shadowy enemies. Tom cannot sprint for too long before his stamina runs out. However, in Uncanny Valley, the protagonist cannot die and there are no Game Overs.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2015-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/024f0bc84fe5aefc4868aa8fa1db14a4.jpg", "website": "http://cowardlycreations.com/uncannyvalley.html", "rating": 2.89, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 104, "owned": 1226, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 64, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 140, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 140, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Digerati Distribution", "Cowardly Creations"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digerati", "Digerati Distribution", "Cowardly Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
