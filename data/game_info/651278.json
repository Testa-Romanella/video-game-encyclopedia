With that question, let us introduce you to the world of Spindle where indeed nobody dies anymore. And the answer to the question is rather simple: Chaos. Pure disorder. A mess which needs to be cleaned up. But to clean things up, Death first needs to figure out, what is going on and why it's going. Grab your scythe, ask your little pig-friend to join the journey and let's go adventuring.\n<br/><br/>\nSpindle is an oldschool zeldaesque experience where you slip into the role of Death. But you won't be alone: A loyal comapnion, a friend who will stay at your side even through the darkest of times, a mate you can always rely on will always follow you: The pig. Your little shiny pink buddy. In fact, the pig is more than that. It will help you on your mission, to restore the natural order.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Be the one and only Death</li>\n<li>Enjoy a beautiful handfcrafted pixelworld</li>\n<li>Explore grim dungeons</li>\n<li>Solve puzzles</li>\n<li>Pet the Pig</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T19:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d3fad652114a0168b440d28cee16210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 35}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Let's GameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Deck13"], "esrb_rating": null}
