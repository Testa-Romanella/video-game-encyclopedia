RPG and the announcement of its sequel in the form of M.E.A.T. II Absolute Zero (whose free demo is already available!), the time has come for another title. M.E.A.T. Veterans is a fully free-to-play online action game that will take you back to the fantastic world explored through the pixel art RPG from the M.E.A.T. universe.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Get ready for a lot of new features! This time you won't be hiding behind the back of Sir Dunkan Culligan. Instead of impersonating a character, you will remain yourself. And you'll be the only one you can count on to fight the enemy. Well, unless you decide to form an alliance and fight in the name of the team. However, you must be ready for anything, because the enemy never sleeps. And he can quickly revive. And most importantly, know that it can be anyone. Even your existing friend.<br/>Why? Because in M.E.A.T. Veterans you'll be up against a formidable opponent - the opponent on the other side of the screen!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>M.E.A.T. Veterans is a multiplayer shooter, and that means you'll face not just NPCs, but the truest players. Well, unless you're initially afraid of confrontation - there's nothing stopping you from testing your mettle against Bots beforehand. Nevertheless, your time will come, so start training now!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Currently, you can do this on two maps. One is the familiar Sudbury town from the M.E.A.T. RPG, and the other is the MBS XII Sect Crypt. There are four gameplay modes to choose from:<br/><ul><li>Team Deathmatch (a team game characterised by quick respawns - the team with the most enemies defeated wins),<br/></li><li>Deathmatch (an individual game with random respawn and 3-second spawn protection). </li></ul><br/>You have a variety of weapons at hand, including a revolver, shotgun, rotary machine gun, crossbow, dynamite, smoke grenade and even a Molotov cocktail or Tomahawk. But that's not all your options.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The list of weapons will continue to grow with future updates. However, you already have the opportunity to fully customise your weapons with skins and stickers available in the shop, as well as extensive settings, for example in the form of a customised sight. You can also individualise your profile with avatars, badges and achievements.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You will also be able to make your presence felt - for example through the spray system, but also, and perhaps above all, through the possibility of saving your position in the global player ranking.<br/>A significant improvement, especially in the team game modes, is the voice chat, thanks to which you will be able to keep in touch with other players.</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T02:58:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7e/b7eb730d2db297cdedf3156488058f07.jpg", "website": "https://meatrpg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trippin Bears"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Trippin Bears"], "esrb_rating": null}
