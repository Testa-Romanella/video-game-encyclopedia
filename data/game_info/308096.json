Now, with nowhere left to call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin towns of the rocky coast, discover the truth of the Fog, and, if possible, put an end to it.<br />\nRaise a ridge of stone to block the enemy&#39;s approach. Flick an ember into the brush where enemy archers hide, then push a swell of water to intercept the flames before they endanger your own side. Evolve your party into a well rounded squad to better control the wild complexity of nature, or specialize and hazard the risks.<br />\nFeaturing:<br />\nvast open-world exploration<br />\nhighly interactive natural systems such as terrain height, soil moisture, plant growth, fluid flow, heat and fire<br />\n25+ goblin evolutions: shamans, druids, warlocks, wights, lavamancers, bog witches, knights, and more<br />\n-<br />\nFor now this is a small window into a very large project.
