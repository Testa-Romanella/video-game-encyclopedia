This is the outcome of our really weird and hella fun experiment. <br/><br/>You're Jamie, a Raptor-Cyborg-Postman living the post-apokalypse in three acts. With \"F\" and \"J\" you navigate through his life. Firstly, you have to collect all the letters in the post office. But be careful, you can only move through magnets drawing you to them or pushing you off. Made it through? Perfect! Let's jump to Jamie's last tour before the post-apokalypse. Now you drive through the town, putting the mail into the right mailboxes. But be careful to collect enough food on the way, else you won't make it! With the end of this drive, you'll end up in the hospital. The accident was really bad, but as ambitious as our beloved protagonist is, he aims to leave the hospital without official release. You take control over his heartbeat and breathing and lead him through the hospital and into the city. <br/><br/>We're a weird bunch of german gamedesign- and programming-students: <br/><br/>Programming <br/><br/>Julian Viezens <br/>Vivien Baguio <br/>Benjamin Barz <br/>Sebastian Krause <br/>Yasmin Juncker <br/><br/><br/>Art <br/><br/>Maxine Hammen <br/>Julia Wolf <br/>Saskia Hohmann <br/>Michelle Kaufmann <br/>Maximilian Furrer <br/>Yasmin Schraven <br/><br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>Vivien Baguio <br/>Julian Viezens</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6037d868d0567395b0b5a88ca99a94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["hollowspecter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
