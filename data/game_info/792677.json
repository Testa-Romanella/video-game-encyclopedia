What you see/hear is what you get for now. The game is also likely not super optimized, sorry (again: something, something, time constraints)</li><li>You can only close the game by pressing <strong>ESC</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>I <em>might </em>release an update to the game later down the line, fixing some of these issues. We'll see.<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<ul><li>@SIACTRO - for surviving this grind of a weekend with me</li><li>Music by MusMus https://musmus.main.jp/</li><li>Xbox controller buttons by - https://zacksly.itch.io/<br/></li><li>My Twitch chat - for existing</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T15:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b0f606b09e7c646c09c910da09d866b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AGrumpyFox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
