It is a Counter-Strike spin-off developed on the original GoldSrc engine. The game is only available in Europe, CIS countries, NA, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original Counter-Strike, where the counter-terrorists were put against terrorists, CSN: Z offers a PvP and PvE zombie experience. Most of the original games are present in the game with minor edits. </p>\n<p>Players are free to choose the character they want to play as with every character offering their own set of skills and abilities. Female characters are also present. </p>\n<p>There is much more weaponry rather than in the original CS. Players can buy new weapons using the in-game store for in-game currency which can be bought using real money. Weapon skins are also present.
