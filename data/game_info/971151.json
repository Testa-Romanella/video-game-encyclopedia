Clear all virus blocks to win the stage and progress through all 20 levels. The title menu features a level select and every stage features a reset button in case all hope is lost. Stacking blocks to high causes you to lose the stage and have to start over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInspired by retro games of the same genre. Curing Covid started as a solo project for an indie game jam with the theme \"Quarantine\" and slowly morphed into a 20 stage block puzzle game with an original dubstep theme song and virus sprites.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T06:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c593983af313603b62ca3d947ec54341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SteelySam"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SteelySam"], "esrb_rating": null}
