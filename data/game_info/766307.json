Separation</p><p>2. Alignment</p><p>3. Cohesion</p><p>Separation is mostly about obstacle avoidance. Each agent will steer away from obstacles, and that includes other agents.</p><p>Alignment means that each agent will steer towards the alignment of other agents.</p><p>Cohesion will make each agent try to go towards any other nearby agent.<br/></p><p>In this simulation, you can activate the 3 behaviors independantly, as well as tweak other settings. More will be added in the future, as well as being mobile friendly.</p><p>I derived most of the infomation used to create the simulation this from this behavioural study from the university of Toronto, with inspiration from that paper as wellfor future updates.<br/></p><p>Idea spawned from this video by Sebastian Lague video. Code is entirely my own.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e1912385081ccf9c43e9db657ff90d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Glaas"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
