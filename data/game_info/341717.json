You, Forlorn \u2014 a pilgrim caught out of time, and follower of the Resonant \u2014 are called upon by the shadow of the late King Cadmus. Cadmus implores you to save the children of Qurrhem, and the realm of Cadmeia. In a time before Blood Memory, you stand alone between death and deliverance\u2026 for the forgotten cannot die, as they have truly never lived\u2026 until this day.<br/><br/>Prove your worth against the embodiment of death, Gravetender Anku, only after meeting the Breach Knight sent by Kerr for the first time. Then quickly cross through Cadmeia to deliver its inhabitants from peculiar medicine men, hellhounds, and monsters. At the heart of Qurrehm, High Clarus Alina \u2013 loyal acolyte of Cadmus \u2013 awaits, perhaps as Corrupt or Corrupter. Chaos and confusion plague the realm.
