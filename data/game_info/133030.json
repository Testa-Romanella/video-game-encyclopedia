And finally show your rival who's the <strong>real </strong>angler.</p>\n<p>Move your angler using left stick. Use LB or LT to start fishing.</p>\n<p>While fishing you can continue moving, although a bit slower.</p>\n<p>Move your hook using right stick. If you catch something, reel it in making circular counter-clockwise motion with right stick! Reel it fast, reel it hard!</p>\n<p>If you catch a fish - great, another point for you good sir!</p>\n<p>Everything else... Well you should throw it out of the lake or maybe - just maybe - throw it at your opponent to disrupt his focus.</p>\n<p>Throw items using RB or RT to clean the lake (or your opponents face if you like).</p>\n<p>From time to time, there might be some ducks arriving on the lake. You... wouldn't dare to throw a duck at your opponent would you?</p>\n<p>Created by:<br/></p>\n<p>Szymon Licau ( @szymon_licau )</p>\n\n<p>\u0141ukasz Kie\u0142czykowski ( @luckyluk92 )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f641a35353768f264878c485b95e0014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luckyluk", "Nitwoe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
