{"id": 780239, "slug": "lyra-matrix-city-ue5", "name": "Lyra Matrix City UE5", "name_original": "Lyra Matrix City UE5", "description": "<p>Here is a project I created using the Matrix city made by Epic for Unreal Engine 5, combined with the Lyra gameplay framework.\u00a0A number of modifications and optimizations to the city were made\u00a0as well as putting in a day/night cycle. There are likely to be some bugs and glitches which I may fix in the future.</p>\n<p>While the original Matrix city demo is very demanding for your computer hardware to run,\u00a0this\u00a0game has many graphics options to use so you can configure your video settings. However,\u00a0anyone attempting to play with 99 bots will need a high end computer to run it smoothly, and a SSD is recommended.</p>\n<p>Gamepad works well except for the option to change the number of bots in the menu requires a keyboard input. Valid number of bots range from 1 to 99 which will be split into two teams of red and blue. The time and score limit are set very high and each player can use a grenade and dash which the bots do not utilize. Smart use of the dash can allow you to climb on top of the buildings and get a vantage point to fight from.</p>\n<p>As I\u00a0cannot upload large files to itch.io, the 15.9GB download file is hosted on 1fichier.com.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eefdf9755a67a5ac0cd97c1fbd58bd2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndrewG"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
