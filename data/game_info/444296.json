It's a simple and short RPG without any real goal for the moment, but it was made in GB Studio as a means to test out my pixel art and music composing skills. I don't plan on updating this version of the game any longer but I have plans for a better version in the future!</p>\n<p>Currently in this little demo, you can traverse a small world as you go on a quest to find old man Frank's old necklace! This quest will take you through some odd towns to meet some strange characters, buy some fancy power gauntlets, go through a spooky forest and complete a temple that's probably a bit too easy!<br/></p>\n<p>The combat system is pretty basic and does have a few bugs, however it's my first time really working with making something like that from scratch, since GB Studio doesn't have much to start with in it's default template.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am aware of a few bugs in this, however I won't be fixing any considering this is not meant to be a fully polished game, but rather a fun demo made in around a week for the sake of testing things out and having fun! Our next project however is surely going to be more polished and complete.</p><p><strong>Full Soundtrack</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24aa04980423987da2e169257e4f8c77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shy Gecko Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
