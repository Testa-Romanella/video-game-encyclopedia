By uploading the game here I'm hoping to find people to help me develop the game by playtesting with me.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this game you play as a LEGALLY DISTINCT combat robot. Outthink your opponent by placing explosives in the most horrible places you can think of, also there are guns.<br/></p>\n<p>To play: You will need to port forward and press 'Server' to host, and your friend will need to enter your modem IP into the text field below 'Client' and press 'Client' to connect to you. The input field next to 'Server' is the number of players determined by the host.<br/></p>\n<p>There's no proper code to handle death and respawn yet, so when you're done with a match you have to restart the game and reconnect. sorry. There is a spectator camera at least.<br/></p>\n<p>DEFAULT CONTROLS:<br/>WASD to move, space to jump. Mouse controls pitch and yaw when on the ground, pitch and roll when in the air.<br/>Q: Hold to open radial item select. Use mouse to select from the radial wheel and release Q to accept.<br/>F: Place held object.<br/>Shift: Throw held object.<br/>E: Activate world object (doors, mines, etc.). Use scroll wheel to select which action you wish to perform.<br/>LMB: Fire weapon, does nothing when holding mine.<br/>RMB: Zoom.<br/>R: Toggle light.<br/></p><p>Join our discord: https://discord.gg/3YEmMWF Please join if you want to play this game, I can show you how to play and I would love to have more people to play with!
