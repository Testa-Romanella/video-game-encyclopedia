That sounds like <strong>Blades in the Dark</strong>!\" you've come to the right spot. This is an early attempt to put together a tabletop version of DD using the BitD rule set.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Right now, the game needs further fleshing out, but it should be playable and feature-complete. It's here if you want to put some eyes-on, or even playtest if you're up for it. If you catch any little horrors certain to be hiding in the shadows and under the dressers, let me know. Looking forward to your feedback!</p>\n<p><em>Note: this is a fan-creation and is not sanctioned or approved by Red Hook.</em></p>\n<p>Also, if you haven't played Darkest Dungeon, you should. It's awesome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41fda798b35b1f06de0f91de1ebc0e8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greyorm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
