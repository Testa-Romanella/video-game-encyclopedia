A black flow cuts through stone and threatens to spill once more across the world. The ancient tetraform calls, and with it come unearthly powers.<br />\nCatapult yourself through the air, use the power drawn from fallen creatures to slow time, and cut through the swarms of dark beings with a razor-edge boomerang. Travel through once bustling locales, sacrificed to hide a myth, and descend the Godpath into the lost realms below. Cleanse these halls and ensure that whatever lies beneath doesn\u2019t come back.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T17:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cfa/cfa29784df7f1ebcfe534dfc76b8dc36.jpg", "website": "http://boomerang-x.com/", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 103, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 30, "dropped": 7, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["DANG!"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
