I do have quite a lot of experience in Unreal Engine 4, but the restrictions of this game jam led me to decide that I might as well give Unity another go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prospect of doing everything myself - art, audio, animation - on top of design was terrifying, and explains why this was suggested as a team game jam. This was especially worrying as I also stumbled to gain comfortable footing in Unity.</p>\n<p>Despite all of this, I've surprised myself with how much I've managed to figure out as I went, without using any tutorials (a stupid way to approach this, I know, but I wanted to make something that was entirely my own), and I think I've managed to create a half-decent game.</p>\n<p>I still prefer working in UE4, just because I've made twice as many games in Unreal than I have in Unity so I'm more used to it.\u00a0 That being said, I don't think I'm afraid of using Unity any more, which is good. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/0248d21dbafc472e2c09a0aad4aae5f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adsjohansen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
