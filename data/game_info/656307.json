The faster you are, the more powerful you get! Increase your chaos level by beating up enemies as fast as possible, and grow your power. But be aware, as your chaos level increases, the enemies will get more aggressive. While being hit will reduce your chaos, it is also a good occasion to shoot them all faster, and get more powerful, to set a record time. Try to beat the three stages as fast as you can, and register your high scores. Try to improve your best times each time you play!</p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!
