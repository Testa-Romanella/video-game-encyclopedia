I can't keep it locked for so long so launch it in this condition. I want to see if there's any potential by receiving feedback from you. The more feedback = the faster the development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Before you play:\u00a0</strong><br/>-Pressing <strong>Shift </strong>to run or <strong>M </strong>to jump back wastes your stamina (invisible yet). So don't press it all the time and just wait a bit.<br/>-Saves don't work for now. They only save your location. (still figuring out how to add saves. So let it be \"rougelike\" for now)</p><p>-------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions leave them here - I'll be happy to read them and add to the game if possible.</p>\n<p>If you're a fellow dev that wants to help - reach out to me directly. Cuz not gonna lie I need some help with this mess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad0de0247d5854db30011bf345f90a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rascott"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
