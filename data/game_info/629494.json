The theme was Dread and the limit was that dice must be a mechanic.</p>\n<p>The game plays like a board game (and\u00a0I was out of time to automate it)</p>\n<p>Grab a friend and play!</p>\n<ul><li>Roll the dice with the \"Roll\" button. Choose one to be your movement (move the number of spaces as indicated by the die you choose, in any direction)</li><li>Press \"Spacebar\" the number indicated on the other die (this will move the death wall closer to the other corner)</li><li>If at any time, a player's piece is on the same tile as the death wall (big red wall), it is removed and the other player wins!</li><li>Press ESC to close the game</li></ul>\n<p>Keep in mind this is a roughly made game, so it might be hard to tell which number the dice land on, just roll again if that happens.<br/>If I were to go on making the game, I'd add automation, as well as different abilities/items to alter the dice rolled. I'd also add some different maps and whatnot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bf441cbc6e849edf02e9c247b37edc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Salty Slug"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
