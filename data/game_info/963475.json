If you get zapped, you lose health. If you lose enough health, it's game over.<br/><br/>How you go about avoiding the lasers is the fun part. You play as a world-class athlete who can jump like a pole vaulter, contort like a gymnast, and dress in fun costumes. You also have the ability to bend time--that part especially comes in handy.<br/><br/>With just one button you can halve the speed of any given animation. While the lasers continue to move at the same pace, you can hang in the air for several seconds or, if necessary, keep your belly on the ground. It also looks really cool.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T03:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d234d64683e01af97e75db9c8144d4d9.jpg", "website": "https://finessevideogame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abscure Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Abscure Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
