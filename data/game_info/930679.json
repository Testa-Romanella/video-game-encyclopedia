{"id": 930679, "slug": "siege-adriiiiii", "name": "Siege (Adriiiiii)", "name_original": "Siege (Adriiiiii)", "description": "<p><strong>SIEGE</strong> is a simple Action Based Skirmish game intended to be a framework for War scenes in concept videos, youtuber content and Small Projects that have both melee and Ranged Battles.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is Currently a Prototype that includes both Melee and Ranged Combat. The Current game mode simply consists of\u00a0 2 warring factions, that Fight each other until the Match Countdown ends, the Team with the Most Kills Wins the Fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Game was Formulated as an Idea of attempting to recreate the large battles in some my favourite games such as <strong>Skyrim's Civil War Quest, The Dawnguard Battle,\u00a0 Oblivion's Siege of Kvatch, and\u00a0Dragon Age\u00a0origin's battles</strong></p>\n<p>This was also for me to learn more about optimization as I am currently working on other projects that require more variables such as directional combat and explorable interactive environments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My intention was to learn to streamline my workflow and improve on coding as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>The Game utilizes very standard controls,\u00a0<br/><br/>ATTACKING - Left Mouse Button or Right Bumper on Gamepad</p>\n<p>BLOCKING/AIM WITH BOWS - Right Mouse Button or Left Trigger on Gamepad</p>\n<p>DODGING - Left Alt or Right Face Button on Gamepad</p>\n<p>WEAPON SWAP - Q or Top Face Button on Gamepad</p>\n<p>SPRINTING - Shift or Left Thumbstick Button on Gamepad</p>\n<p><strong>INSTALLATION</strong></p>\n<p>Simply Download the ZIP and extract it anywhere on your\u00a0PC. and Launch the exe file in the game's Directory folder.<br/><br/><strong>FUTURE PLANS</strong></p>\n<p>One of my Priorities with Improvements is the Impact of Hits. While it is a framework, I still would like to Improve on the feel so as to capture better sequences.<br/><br/>Animation Variety is Also one of the things I wish to include, as a Skirmish type of Game; Variety with Weapons and how they are played is one of the things I consider</p>\n\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS!</strong> to Everyone who considers this Project!\u00a0It is really early right now and there is definitely stuff I wish to add and do better, but initially this was a test to stretch myself before I continue to do a lot of the Projects I plan on doing as well as the projects I'm currently In.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll continue to work on everything and There will definitely be more in the future.<br/><br/>A preview of My Direction Based Combat project, right now Called\u00a0\"Project Impact\"<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T20:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79cd0ce06d7719f0104be48a6bf73bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adriiiiii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
