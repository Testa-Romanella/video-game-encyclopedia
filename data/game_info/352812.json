{"id": 352812, "slug": "hungry-ghosts-2", "name": "Hungry Ghosts", "name_original": "Hungry Ghosts", "description": "<p>Made for the \"Choose Your Own Adventure - Hunger\" game jam hosted by Kay and\u00a0Chris Slater (http://creativeinteractions.club/), this RPG Maker adventure tells the story of a couple in ancient China whose relationship goes horribly wrong. It's up to the player to travel back in time and rewrite their history to save them, using the iChing fortune telling coins. This game is a \"vertical slice\" of a much larger game idea; during the 12 days of the game jam, I only had time to implement one of the maps (the Forest map, the link for which is the tree). The other maps are not yet functional, but can be viewed. When complete, the choices made on all eight maps will affect the outcome - right now, with just one map fully functional, the outcome is far less complex than envisioned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21f0bd5e6700439052bbb9dae4ddf219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lisa Smedman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
