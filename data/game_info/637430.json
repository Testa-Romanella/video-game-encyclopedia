Both parties are more than willing to exterminate outside threats, which include you.<h3>Unleash the power of SISU</h3>Jarmo can harvest magical SISU-energy by eradicating his enemies after unlocking his hidden powers. This energy can be used to activate SISU-mode where your weapons transform into super-powered versions with new features.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-03T23:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35bb9e7b05b62376efbbc6ae3973432e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Raulus", "Mikko Tamper"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Raulus", "Mikko Tamper"], "esrb_rating": null}
