A mysterious voice is guiding you and waits for you at the end, but first you must show you have what it takes to reach the goal.</p>\n<p>La Petite Avril is a small game I made to celebrate the birth of my daughter Avril. Being new parents, my wife and I were very nervous and scared throughout the process and although the pregnancy went smoothly we imagined dangers in every corner.</p>\n<p>This game is the representation of that adventure, where I imagine my little girl fighting against monsters, crossing deep rivers, solving riddles and traveling through space in order to be with us.</p>\n<p>It is a short game, but very fun and challenging. The Time Trial mode offers an extra challenge for those that want to test their skills.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little adventure as much as we do.</p>\n<p>I'm AJ Ordaz and this is the real Avril</p>\n\n<p>(she ended up not having green hair)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>Privacy Policy</p>\n<p>PRIVACY POLICY This privacy policy applies to the collection of games, apps and websites (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Services\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) provided by Fab\u00fcla Game House\u00a0https://fabula.itch.io/ (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fab\u00fcla Game House\u00e2\u20ac\u009d).</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>Fab\u00fcla Game House respects your privacy rights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising<br/>(1) Services may be partly financed through advertising.
