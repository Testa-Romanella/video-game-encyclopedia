{"id": 389965, "slug": "proc-gun-procjam-19", "name": "Proc-gun (procjam '19)", "name_original": "Proc-gun (procjam '19)", "description": "<p><em>NOTE: Level loads on start/level completion, the game isn't\u00a0frozen.</em></p>\n<p>An early prototype of an FPS roguelike I'm working on. This build is for the lovely PROCJAM. Currently there is only a single level-type and enemy-type, and the game will proceed endlessly. Planning on adding a lot more variety later. Controls are typical FPS controls, including Q/E leaning. Known issues described below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Procedurally generated levels</li><li>Relatively low TTK and tactical gun-play</li><li>GOAP enemies (similar technique as F.E.A.R.)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Current proc-gen algo:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Place nodes for rooms in rows.</li><li>Spawn rooms.</li><li>Path-find hallways connecting between every room in each row with every room in the next row.</li><li>Add perturbations (random empty tiles to provide more cover.)</li><li>Spawn wall tiles.</li><li>Spawn cover objects.</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Notes &amp; known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>It's hard to move when you crouch.</li><li>Spawning levels takes a moment. This happens at the start of the game and at the end of every level. I'll add a \"loading\" screen shortly.</li><li>Double-jumping is enabled to safeguard if you get stuck.</li><li>Enemies currently produce some lag when they lose their target. Destroying them or moving to the next level should stop it.</li><li>Blood-stain decals can be toggled in the ESC menu. Currently disabled because they don't mask onto the level geometry properly.</li><li>Enemies sometimes jump through walls (lol.)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb0d268ca0ef77f8327a93b1f9952a2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starmote"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
