The part I most wanted to nail was the feel of flying in space for real rather than the arcade style that other space games tend to use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88f90bdca0dfddffd7ecf0bea03641a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Phasechangegames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
