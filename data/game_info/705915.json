It was created during 5\u00a0weeks with a team of 6 persons with different backgrounds.</p>\n<p>The original idea for the game was\u00a0designed by Miro Aurela and a 3 minute presentation pitch for the concept was created together with\u00a0Mark Laukkanen. In a voting among course members, our pitch was selected as the best and this project with the 4 follow-up\u00a0projects were started. The\u00a0team was selected among students inspired by the game concept. After forming the team, the concept was focused together to fit the available time span and the interests of the team member.</p>\n<p>The goal of the project was to\u00a0create a demo showing the potential of the game concept. It explores the possibilities of using total darkness both as a\u00a0game mechanic and an atmospheric tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\r\nMiro AurelaGame &amp; Level Design,\u00a0Programming<br/>Patrik Boman<br/>Environmental artist<br/>Mark Laukkanen\r\nMusic &amp; Sound Design\r\nHenry L\u00e4ms\u00e4<br/>3D &amp; Visual Design<br/>Aliinsti\u00a0Noguest <br/>Programming<br/>Olga Tasanko<br/>Music &amp;\u00a0Sound\u00a0Design<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79ff554f212b484ca8abc8b20ae4549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lrdazrl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
