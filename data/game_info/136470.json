Standing on a balance board, you control the game by leaning towards the left (country) or the right (city) with your body.</p>\n<p>You can pick up items as you move along the way. They represent a diversity of\u00a0Sami lifestyles -\u00a0from traditional salmon fishing to\u00a0reindeer herding helicopters. Life is a balancing act, and your Sami identity is what you make it to be.\u00a0create a future as you like it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to build the custom controller:</strong><br/>1. Glue dowel to the centre of bottom side of wooden board, parallel to short side of board<br/>2. break hinges apart (alternative: screw holes in 2 extra metal plates)<br/>3. Screw 1 hinge each to centre of short edges of board, long side of hinge parallel to long side of the board.<br/>4. Attach 2 aluminium plates to floor approx. 40 cm so that hinges can touch the metal plates when wooden board is placed on the floor.<br/>5. cut footstep shapes out of sandpaper and glue it to top side of the board - optional: use strip of sandpaper to indicate the centre of the board (align with the dowel underneath)\u00a0<br/>6. Cover board with felt piece (we used a single felt piece, but footsteps are OK too)<br/>7. Mount the Makey Makey: left hinge goes to left arrow key, right hinge goes to right arrow key<br/>8. Start the game</p>\n<p>Sabine Harrer - design, hardware<br/>Tatu Laine - programming<br/>Sylvia Smatanov\u00e1- art, animation<br/>Milja Guttorm - idea, Sami expertise<br/>Chris Hamilton- interviews, editing<br/>Elie Abraham - sounds and music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55f11f7e26b0960c786b12081203012b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["enibolas", "tattz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
