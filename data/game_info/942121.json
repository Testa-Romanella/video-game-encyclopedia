I made this game in the span of 2 weeks, as a way to teach myself a new game engine. The game itself is very small and simple, but for my first game, I think that's okay. The sprites and music were all made by me.  Anyway, thanks for checking out this page! I might make more games in the future, so stay tuned...</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:32:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c295060f82da2bb1c9eb376019d512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixadeer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
