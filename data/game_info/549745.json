I made this game under the theme of GGJ 2021, Lost and Found.</p>\n<p>The game is about\u00a0treasure hunting at sea using a detector and a shovel. Upgrade props to find the treasure map faster!</p>\n<p><strong>Game control:</strong></p>\n<p>Left-click to select or lift (when you are using the shovel), right-click to change tools. You have to find 5 pieces of the treasure map on the beach to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Some tips:</strong></p>\n<p>You HAVE to use the detector to find the treasure first then switch to the shovel to lift it.</p>\n<p>Mind the sound. You can hear different sounds while you act, eg. lift nothing/lift something.</p>\n<p>Some objects need more than one click to lift out.</p>\n<p>Update your detector so you can find treasure easier and distinguish it from different objects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T03:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/438/438a07cb799dc730be45cd7f911d9c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ColaIsCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
