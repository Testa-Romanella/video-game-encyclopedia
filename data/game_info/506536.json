Fortunately, a band of four delicious delicacies will do everything in their power to prevent the tea bags from ruining the world\u2019s tea. These protectors travel on a flying saucer to various locations where the tea bags have landed and fight to save the tea. Gingi, Quasisant, Mookaron and Chips (also known as Dirty Chips) are<br/>well seasoned veterans - they may look delicious, but certainly pack a fierce punch. The game sees the four characters fighting teabags on Earth and eventually flying to Mars, the home of all expired tea bags, and destroying them once and for all. Only then can good tea be safe. The game also features a colorful and fun art style with many visual and audio stimuli to keep players interested.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Flying Saucer is perfect for the casual couch gamer, of all ages and gender. It provides a light, fun and humorous experience.
