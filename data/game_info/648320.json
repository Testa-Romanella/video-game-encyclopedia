Each one of them is unique from the other. They have different colors, sizes, and their capacity. Even though their appearance differs from each other, they treat each other as family. One day, Diamond proclaimed that he is the strongest shape of them all. Therefore he should rule the planet Geolife. The rest did not agree with Diamond\u2019s decision. This sparks the conflict between shapes as they believe each of them should be the ruler. As one doesn\u2019t want to be ruled out by another, they decide to battle it out to determine who is the strongest out of them, and then they can only rule. They call it the Battle Shapes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T06:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2de/2de9953c01c020d1f537f73b0badb6ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMC-Don't Panic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
