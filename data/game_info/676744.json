Help her by guiding her focus throughout the levels of this puzzle game. Beware though, concentration is very tricky to maintain and can easily become unstable by the influence of\u00a0bad thoughts or distractions.</p>\n<p>Connect your way to collectables by placing tiles to direct the flow of the Focus Energy. When the Focus Flow becomes too complex (too many tiles placed on the board), Lisa's concentration will become unstable and you\u00a0will have to remove Unstable tiles to let them stabilize themselves.</p>\n<p>Collect all Keys to proceed to the next level :)</p><p>\u00a0We highly recommend you play the downloadable version, it runs smoother and prettier</p><p>Art by Duana Aquino<br/>Code and Design by Gabriel Leite<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:36:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae6877ba8f2473c59bb7351d10a0cb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["glimaleite"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
