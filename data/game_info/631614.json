I combined my old school programming with my kids original artwork and ideas to make a super fun platformer :)  It's an homage to the Megaman series we love so much. It features customizable characters, great music (by heatleybros) &amp; sound effects, fun boss battles, easy &amp; hard settings to boost replayability as well as multiple endings and a special unlockable character. it supports keyboard, gamepads (including xbox gamepads), and touch screen controls. The free version includes the first four levels of the game, and only supports basic sound effects I programmed, the full version supports high quality music and sounds. The save game function is also only available in the full version. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bd5cca2835ce48d216d7405a259f8ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazy-Q-bee"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
