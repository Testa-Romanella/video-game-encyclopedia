Shoot with the space bar.</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION: </strong>Budgie Defender is a game in which a giant bird defends its planet against alien invaders. The aliens attack by dumping snakes from their UFOs. The budgie fights back by launching explosive ice creams from its beak.\u00a0 \u00a0Resupply of ammunition comes via air drops in the form of giant ice cream cones.\u00a0 \u00a0Destroyed UFOs explode and anything nearby will also be destroyed. This can sometimes lead to a cascade of explosions if other explodable items are nearby.\u00a0 Ammunition supplies can be accidentally destroyed either by shooting at them or by causing a nearby explosion.\u00a0 Ammunition explosions are larger than UFO explosions. Because of this, it can sometimes be beneficial to shoot at them if you already have a decent size reserve of ammunition.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is one special holographic UFO piloted by Mark. This UFO cannot be destroyed and never attacks either side. Mark is a neutral observer and has no effect on the game other than possibly causing some loss of ammunition if you mistakenly try to shoot at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, UFOs move faster and new ones appear more frequently.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The budgie dies when touched by a snake. After 5 lives are lost, the game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac7cbf5ccae9de79aff7fef3bcbb7c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChooKing"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
