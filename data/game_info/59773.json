Survive for as long as you can without crashing into the light trails left by you and your opponents! Your speed is ever-increasing, so collect orbs to slow down if things get too fast! And be careful with those brakes; if they overheat, you'll explode! These vehicles definitely don't adhere to governmental safety regulations!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures include:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Two gravity-defying arenas!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Split-screen with up to four players!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Simple pick-up-and-play controls!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Bots to battle against if you don't have friends around!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Bots to battle against if you do have friends around but they're busy doing other stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Bots to battle against if you just don't have any friends!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- But the bots can't really do anything except play this game almost competently, so don't get too attached! They won't go to the movies with you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/34924d44ac02e574ac0ba03ca006b00f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MooCow Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MooCow Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
