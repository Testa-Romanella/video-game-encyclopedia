{"id": 11638, "slug": "bottle", "name": "Bottle", "name_original": "Bottle", "description": "Bottle is a very short game in which you play as an alcoholic man of solitude. It is about the mood of melancholy in winter nature. As you walk through the path, you see the visions of a woman and hear the poems she leaves to you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis mystical, atmospheric, and relaxing game takes only 15 minutes to finish, therefore there is no save system. And there are flamey-looking temporary speed boosts scattered around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBottle is the re-creation of the game called \"Bottle\" which was released back in 2016. Its content has been made from scratch except the charming music is the same.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInstead of action and/or interaction, this game is for those who mostly seek to slowly experience the mood: That's the combination of winter nature, melancholic poems, warm piano music, emotional voice acting... \"atmosphere\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T00:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37b/37b4b4e49ef05b67c5395857c34093d1.jpg", "website": "http://tongucbodur.myportfolio.com/bottle", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 112, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 424, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur", "Pixel Prime"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tongu\u00e7 Bodur", "Pixel Prime"], "esrb_rating": null}
