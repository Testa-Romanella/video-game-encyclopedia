Timing is key.<br/><br/>rr is the 5th installment in our focus series of apps we've been releasing of late. But this is a biggie - not 1 but 2 circles to deal with. All the fun of aa, uu, ff &amp; au, packed into 2 circles. Test your skills to the limit. You'll instantly know how to play and hav endless entertainment.<br/><br/>One of the endearing aspects of rr is that each level has theoretically infinite ways it can be solved. Every piece you add, then effects how the next piece is going to be added, it's entirely up to you how you go about solving each level.<br/><br/>You can also top the leaderboard and earn medals! (bronze, silver and gold). There's 150 levels to solve right now, intertwined with all sorts of tweaks and surprises. You can also go back and replay any level you've already passed, at any time (Choose Level). If you're stuck on a really tricky level, skip it! (Tap Skip on the Fail Screen) If you can't wait, unlock all 150 levels and replay at your own pace! (Choose Level &gt; Unlock All Levels)<br/><br/>Thanks for all your support, I hope you're enjoying the \"focus\" series thus far.<br/><br/>Handmade in Australia,<br/>General Adaptive", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T23:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/626655c61c846f28038d0b4a31141a43.jpg", "website": "https://generaladaptive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["General Adaptive Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["General Adaptive Apps"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
