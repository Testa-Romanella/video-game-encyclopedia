{"id": 95583, "slug": "portalkitpro-vr-demo-very-old", "name": "PortalKitPro VR Demo (very old)", "name_original": "PortalKitPro VR Demo (very old)", "description": "<p>A quick demo of Portal Kit Pro's tech for use in VR, desktop games, and on mobile. Controls are simple- triggers to place portals, trackpad to move, and the grip to grab objects.</p>\n<p>This demo is very similar to the popular game Portal, but the actual portal system is general-application and behaves as expected for almost anything including raycasting (shooting through portals), physics, through-portal interactions (such as reaching into a portal bag, grabbing a sword, and drawing it), and more. Additionally, the portals are extremely optimized, and run quickly on everything from VR apps to phone games.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is the first demo, so there may be bugs. If you get any, please report them to me. I would appreciate it. </p>\n<p>(If you do not have a VR headset but still wish to take a look, here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K_Lcf9g_C4)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d019fdf5eb780e281d13ebd7923fbed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phygon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
