To put that into perspective, Final Fantasy VIII has 110 cards, and Final Fantasy XIV has approximately 320.<br/><br/>Players choose from one of thirty selectable established Final Fantasy characters to be their avatar in a game world where a deity named Dionysos, a god of revelry, pierced through the multiverse to invite characters from all universes to come and play Triple Triad in his Palace of Revelry with the promise of a grand prize to anyone capable of winning all six elemental tournaments. There are no battles, no levels, just CARDS!<br/><br/>Players can enter card tournaments, practice in their team headquarters, interact with many NPCs (who will either play cards, offer side quests, or just chat), or engage in side activities such as an extensive Final Fantasy trivia game or search for Gilgamesh's weapons which have been scattered throughout the Palace of Revelry. Cards can be won in matches, purchased, or acquired through activities/quests. They can even be sold for gil in order to buy booster packs!<br/><br/>While this is primarily just a fun thing I wanted to do in my spare time, which I wasn't even originally going to post on any sites, it is also a game and I hope that it is one that my fellow Triple Triad junkies will appreciate!</p>\n\n<p>- Six card tournaments to enter.<br/>- Thirty characters to choose from.<br/>- Over one hundred opponents to play cards against.<br/>- One hundred and fifty trivia questions to answer.<br/>- Three hundred and sixty cards to collect.<br/>- Several secrets littered throughout the game world!<br/>- Countless hours of card gaming action!<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to join the game's hosted Discord server below to report any errors or freely discuss the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:50:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/489/489b2302410ff2a6433aa2a8d1b89160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UPRC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
