Cards cost energy, which\u00a0you gain over time. You control the left field,\u00a0your enemies control the right field. If you\u00a0have more towers standing than your foe when\u00a0time expires, you win!</p>\n<p>Development Progress</p>\n<p>Today, Jung is just a prototype. In the future, the goal is for Jung to become a run-based game (aka rogue-lite), where you will develop your deck of creatures and spells to grow more powerful, acquire artifacts that give you unique bonuses, and fight ever more powerful enemies on your quest. As Jung is just a passion side-project, this will probably take a long time to happen, if it ever happens :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08a7f39e3b5187447189cb6a0cb2e10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NastyManatee"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
