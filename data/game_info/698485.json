Fun fact: This was supposed to be one hour challenge, but I had main game idea finished in under 25 minutes and I didn't want to bother with graphics, so I kept it like that (actually, I can't draw so I woudn't make it anyway.). It isn't too much polished, though. I might update this game, adding graphics, more featurec, etc in future.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Movement</strong>: WASD</p><p><strong>Game restart after Game Over: </strong>[SPACE]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T07:48:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/792a2a913607d69287cc4f506535f526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lasermtv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
