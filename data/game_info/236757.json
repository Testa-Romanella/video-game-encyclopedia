A briefcase handcuffed to the wrist is a reliable source of trouble. And New Era Cyberchurch is zealously watching those who are overly superstitious\u2026<br/>\r\nWho are you? What\u2019s going on? And what\u2019s that bothersome noise in your head? A big hunt for a weird briefcase. And you are just an obstacle. Do you want to survive? Do you want to work it out? Action is what you need. Quick. Precise. Cool-headed.<br/>\r\nMechanical eyes are watching you from all sides. The iron brain is recording all your steps. Don\u2019t make a slip.<br/>\r\nIs your doom handcuffed to your arm a curse or an aid? It\u2019s up to you to decide.<br/>\r\nIt\u2019s hard to stay invisible with a briefcase in your hand, but the equipment fitted in your bracelet makes break-in considerably easier. Also, it is the most expensive shield in the history of humankind!<br/>\r\nWhat game style will you choose? Sneak up in silence or crush sculls. Hack cyberheads or make holes in them! Many ways, one goal.<br/>\r\nHow can you use implants knocked out of the enemies? Or force your way feeling no pain?

What\u2019s behind their smiles?<br/>\r\nRisk or rationale? The enemies are smart. Too smart to let you walk and get your memories easily. It will be a trip to remember.
