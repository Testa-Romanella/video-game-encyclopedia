Stylistically and story-wise, I wanted to reflect the spirit of fantasy/sci-fi movies and books that I was the recipient of in my youth.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame:<br/>\r\nWe control the eye of a magician who explores alternative dimensions. We jump on platforms, roll, collect magic potions, avoid traps and chasms. The main goal is to collect all \"Knowledge nodes\" in current dimension, which allows us to open a portal to the next one. In further stages we will have to confront the passage of time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T04:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb1ff632020f47bed02fb68d18f14745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["FM Simple Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FM Simple Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
