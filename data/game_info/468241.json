Of the 10 days we had, according to my timer this took me almost 9 of them!</p>\n<p>It's inspired a lot by Zelda 2 and Megaman, though I'm awful at both, hah!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>-Dustimancer</p>\n\n<p>Mech n' Parcel is a game about a world where even after the apocalypse, people still need to get their mail. Of course the outside world is dangerous, so the delivery drivers are mech pilots. What else would they do?</p>\n<p>You get given a life-changing job, but the route you'll have to take will be a lot more dangerous than your normal routes. Cut through Pyro's, Green Thumb's , and Flywheel's territory to get your package to the recipient!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd3fb39a9e6adc9609a4b3799daa013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoboDusty"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
