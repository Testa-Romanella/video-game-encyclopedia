Also to feed it.\u00a0<br/>Also nothing is free in this life. You will have to put your little baby pet to work so you can afford to give it all the love you really want to. Training it will help with working speed but working and training does take the shine off life a bit.\r\nPats are free though. Who doesnt love a good pat.\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\nAfter you hatch your pet you will need to manage hunger and happiness - these are key to a long life!\r\nYou can pat your pet - as a baby and when it is old it will appreciate this but in adulthood it will just make it grumpy!\r\nYou send your pet to work to get credits to buy interaction points including food, play, (more!) work and training. Training will increase your pets work speed (hidden) however it really doesn't like training!\r\n<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>\n\n<p><em>This game was made for Ludum Dare 46 Compo, a 48 hour solo Game Jam.</em><br/></p>\n<p>The game was developed from scratch in an empty Unity project.
