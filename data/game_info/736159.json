{"id": 736159, "slug": "chaos-heat", "name": "Chaos Heat", "name_original": "Chaos Heat", "description": "<p>Yet one more in the realm of m action/adventure is a game from Taito called Chaos Heat. This game is the first to utilize a new system entitled Taito G-NET. An SNK-inspired system, G-NET employs the use of a small card that plugs into a newTaito-standard harness. These cards hold the entire game and are easy to replace. Game memory has been increased, and expanded game features such as a level expansion or the addition of new characters are as simple to implement as plugging in the next card. There seems to be the possibility of upgrading via a network, so no one even has to open the cabinet.</p>\n<p>Chaos Heat plays a lot like Spikeout or Dynamite Deku. You can choose from one of three characters: Rickrider, Mitsuki and Vogt. All of the characters have attributes and abilities that make them special. They also have individual weapons: Vogt&#39;s flamethrower is powerful, but only able to be used at mid- to close range; Rickrider&#39;s energy weapon is powerful and has a better range; and the all-around best weapon is Mitsuki&#39;s machine guns, with sustaining firepower at decent range. All of the characters can pick up items throughout the game that will help you complete the adventure. The special weapons you can pick up are powerful, and some may even kill you if used in close quarters (such as the Pod and obviously the Launcher).</p>\n<p>An intriguing story line changes depending on what character you are, who you defeat and what paths you take. The levels of the game are set up in &quot;divisions,&quot; and your success is rated on how well you complete each of those divisions.</p>\n<p>Chaos Heat&#39;s graphic engine looks the same, if not better than Naomi&#39;s House of the Dead Side Story. This is impressive considering the significant power behind the Dreamcast derived hardware.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T15:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da908c18eda9874aa20d14b271605250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
