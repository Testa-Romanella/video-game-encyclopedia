You can insert the disk and you get a different game each time you play it. How you may ask? Who knows? All we know is what seems to be on the surface.</p>\n<p>This game is a sequel to \"CollinsNightmare.exe\" a game about a boy named Collin who nobody truly knows. This game goes more in-depth of who Collin is...or was. Maybe you can crack the code. It ain't easy after all.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Shift - Run</p>\n<p>Mouse - Point flashlight/Menu</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>SeventyFour Productions\u00a0- Programming / Graphics / Writing / Story</p>\n<p>GamingGreen\u00a0- Graphics / Writing / Story / Bug-testing / Voice-acting</p>\n<p>Bro.
