I\u2019m not really a fan of Superheroes\u2019 so I had a hard time coming up with a unique storyline that would match the plotline of a usual superhero story with the call-to-action and all of that. I came up with Flick by first drawing myself out. I imagined her with blonde hair and being my age because I thought that it would make it easier to write if I envisioned myself. I named her Flick because it\u2019s the name of my favorite Billabong surfer who lives in Hawaii, so she kind of helped me develop a character that wasn\u2019t completely me but someone who I would love to be. From there I started thinking about what kind of superhero I would be if I was one. Of course, all the usual superpowers that other heroes occupy such as strength, speed, teleportation came across my mind, but I struggled finding a plot that would cater one of those powers. I began to think what the problem would be if I ever had the calling to \u201csave the world\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t call myself a total \u201cEarth Conservationist\u201d, but I do value our planet and I would like to keep it beautiful, and I thought it would be an interesting way for a hero to act. With the whole conservation thing in my mind, I began to think about the problem that scientists say is inevitable, which is the sun burning out. That\u2019s how I created Flick\u2019s character, because like the Sun, she needs energy to survive. This differs from Flick\u2019s want because what she truly desires is to bring the Sun back to illuminate Earth.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The decision points in this game were tailored and created to whoever may be reading. I love to travel so I wanted the reader to be able to invision themselves as Flick and make choices for her that they would make themselves. This is shown in the game where the reader has to pick where Flick heads to find energy. The next choice in the game decides how Flick gets to the chosen destination by either boat or plane. I thought readers may like to have the choice because so many people love the thought of flying, while like myself, and Flick truly, are creatures of water and would prefer to sail. In the climax of the story, something goes wrong for Flick that sends her into panic and the reader gets to choose what happens. I thought this was an interesting choice because we all have fears and I thought giving choices would drive the reader to pick what they would be most scared of out of the three options. The final choice in the game is for the excited reader and the cautious reader. The choice is given to collect more energy or go straight to the highest point in Earth to transfer her energy to the sun. If the cautious reader chooses to collect more energy the next passage leads them to the highest point on Earth anyway, so it really is just for their peace of mind.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, I thought Flick was an interesting character to develop as a superhero because she\u2019s just a girl with a lot of energy like me. I hope anyone who plays this game takes advantages of the choices, but never the Sun.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7baff3b8eb8ee031a55c398730f0af3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gilliank2"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
