{"id": 239731, "slug": "whist-lite", "name": "Whist - Lite", "name_original": "Whist - Lite", "description": "The classic game of whist is a plain-trick game without bidding for 4 players in fixed partnerships. There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Partners sit facing each other. A standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: <br/>A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.<br/>The player to the dealer's left leads to the first trick. Any card may be led. The other players, in clockwise order, each play a card to the trick. Players must follow suit by playing a card of the same suit as the card led if they can; a player with no card of the suit led may play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump in it - or if it contains no trump, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.When all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick <br/>they won in excess of 6. The partnership which first reaches 7 points wins the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd1/bd10f8838eeaa53a179c22043975c3b7_EjultF4.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
