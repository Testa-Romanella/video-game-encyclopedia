With an <strong>unstable 3D board</strong> that <strong>can be pushed around</strong> and that <strong>bends from the paddles' weight</strong>, you will have to <strong>adapt</strong> as <strong>gravity and inertia influence the ball</strong>. Use them to your advantage to win against your opponent.<h3>Play against your Friends or AIs !</h3>Invite some friends to your house or through Steam's Remote Play Together to defy them in <strong>2-player Couch Versus</strong>. You can play either on a <strong>single keyboard</strong> or with <strong>gamepads</strong>.<br/>No friends available to play with you ? It's not an issue, as you can play <strong>alone</strong> and <strong>face the AI</strong> with <strong>multiple levels of difficulty</strong>.<br/>Don't feel like playing ? It's fine, you can even watch <strong>AI vs AI</strong> matches.<h3>Fully customize the matches to your needs !</h3><strong>Several game modes</strong> are available for <strong>variety of gameplay</strong>.<br/>Even better, a <strong>lot of options</strong> are available to play the way you want to. From simply changing your <strong>paddle's color</strong> to switching between <strong>2D and 3D perspective</strong>.<br/>You can go all the way <strong>from</strong> playing an <strong>extreme</strong> game <strong>to</strong> just doing a <strong>classic 2D</strong> Pong match.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T04:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e18baaa16e6234ffd4df6e83c668f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axel Born"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Axel Born"], "esrb_rating": null}
