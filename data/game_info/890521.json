His reign makes\u00a0the life of the subjects a living hell, taxing them and requiring people to work more and more. In addition, many children were taken from their homes and families to be trained in his army.<br/></p>\n<p>No one is able to face the evil emperor and his powerful minions... except for a young boy, named Legolas, who is willing to restore peace and order in the kingdom.\u00a0Along his path, our hero will face and defeat\u00a0powerful enemies in order to reach his goal.</p>\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>This version is just a prototype and includes only 5 levels (here called rooms), where Legolas will face several undeads created by the black magic of the Usurper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In each room, all the enemies must be defeated in order to unlock the 3 doors which allow the player to continue his adventure. Above each door, an icon gives an hint on which reward can be obtained in the room behind that door, so the player has to choose carefully. But remember: the reward will spawn only when all enemies are defeated!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Choose your melee or ranged weapons, upgrade your stats and use wisely the environment to\u00a0slay your enemies in Dark\u00a0Unknown.\u00a0At the end of the 5 rooms, a challenging fight against a boss awaits you!<br/></p>\n\r\nIf you want to help us improve our game:\r\n<p><strong>Feedback form</strong></p>\n\r\nDevelopment team:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Angelo Capponcelli</strong>: <em>programmer</em></li><li><strong>Francesco Scandale</strong>: <em>programmer</em></li><li><strong>Luca Fornasari</strong>: <em>programmer / improvised 2D \"artist\"</em></li><li><strong>Matteo Santi</strong>: <em>programmer / level designer</em></li><li><strong>Mattia Carini</strong>: <em>programmer / level designer</em></li></ul>\n\r\nDownload instructions:\r\n<ol><li>Download the zip</li><li>Unzip it</li><li>Play and have fun</li></ol>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The game is meant to be played with the keyboard, you can watch the short video on the top right corner of this page or follow this link.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Commands will be also present on the initial room of the run.</p>\n\n<p>Background music credits: PlayOnLoop.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd70ae52612c191cfe794a7efed53a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
