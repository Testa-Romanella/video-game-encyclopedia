The more bullets on the screen, the more score you get and the more risk it gets.</p>\n<p>It was made in a few days for the #Lowrezjam (2018). I found out the jam a bit late, so I haven't had enough time to polish the game, there was a lot of ideas I couldn't implement, and a lot of things to polish.</p>\n<p>But I'll continue developing it! I really liked the idea.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and for reading :)</p>\n<p>Twitter: @chocoboflo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba410a209729a4e5c29e48e1c80bc54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Suzuka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
