Stripped of your powers, your trident is your only hope of escape. Its lightning can turn objects into the cake you need to overcome challenges and return to your former glory (and weight class).</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>The in-game controls refer to an X button, an O button, and four arrow buttons. On a QWERTY keyboard, these are assigned by default to the X key, the Z key, and the arrow keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3d8c35a2a12662975a389a0214dc713.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kenneth Gagne"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
