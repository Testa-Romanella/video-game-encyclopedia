You're constantly losing your slime, so you have to gain it back by absorbing raindrops from the storm above. Be careful, though! Lightning will tear through your slimy body like butter. Compete to get a higher score and see where you ranked compared to others\u00a0(which is determined through \u00a0Lootlocker) after you die.</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>Programming and Art: FartFish</p>\n<p>Music and Sounds: Maxie</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>ASSETS CREATED BEFORE THE SCORESPACE JAM</p>\n<p>- The ground sprite is a modified ground tile I doodled a while ago.</p>\n<p>- The font was not created by me, but I have gotten commercial use for it.</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>If you are going to leave a review, please don't leave it blank!
