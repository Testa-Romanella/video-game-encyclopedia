Sometimes, a little warmth and comfort is really all one needs.</p>\n<p>Those simple words can't possible be true, can they?</p>\n<p>=========\u00a0</p>\n<p>Project Interlude is a story about a girl and her daily life, her ups and downs, perhaps even her romantic endeavors. Well, sometimes. It's really more about a robot who she meets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The play time is about ten minutes per \"choice\", with mild interactions with the story. Short and sweet.\u00a0Way more is planned and in store, so there's that to look forward to!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game's demo is free. It will likely stay free when it's finished. Money good for support though, but that's in the future when I can add stuff for you to enjoy.</p>\n<p>=========</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Story, Art, and Programming :\u00a0\u00a0teamdaisuke\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music :\u00a0VN Audio Pack -\u00a0Composer: Tim Reichert</p>\n<p>Memento - Myuu\u00a0Twitter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9ad26f6c0a4661593b8c9bde6d63ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daisukejosher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
