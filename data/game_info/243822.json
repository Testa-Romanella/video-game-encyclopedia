There is no other spinner game like it out there! You can play in three modes: free spin, fixed spin and timed spin. There are many spinners to unlock and you may choose from three different categories: movie parodies, sports parodies and mixed designs. You have to swipe left or right to rotate the spinner to collect coins as well as experience points for leveling up. Each fidget spinner has its own unique features such as damping level, gear oil power, swipe power and coin multiplying power. All painted artwork are parodies from famous films (i.e. Sci-Fi, Superheroes/Comics, Adventure), major sports (i.e. Events, Professional Athletes) and nature/abstract designs. Also, every time you turn the wheel you can challenge yourself to achieve a higher RPM and overall score. Now jump in the game, so you can twist and turn away! <br/>Set up a new record &amp; climb up the leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874cde4699f26f1ad2e1bef685f2847a.jpg", "website": "http://www.zoolax.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zoolax"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ZOOLAX"], "esrb_rating": null}
