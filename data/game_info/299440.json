Some have suggested playing in Windowed mode as a workaround. Still investigating, unable to reproduce myself.<br/></p>\n<p>In this survival\u00a0 horror game, you'll have to fend off the mutated victims of a deadly infection, while trying to search for a way out of the hospital.</p>\n<p>This is a very early demo of the game, so some bugs may exist. Please let me know of any you encounter with as much detail as possible as far as the conditions that led up to the bug, what room it happened in, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE -\u00a0</strong>Gamepads not yet supported<br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Loading a checkpoint sometimes has you facing the wrong way when you respawn</li><li>In a rare instance, reloading stopped working, and you have to switch away from your handgun and back again to fix it. I\u00a0haven't been able to reproduce this one, so help tracking it down would be great!</li><li>Some weirdness can occur if you stun an enemy on the same frame that they grab you. I think I got most of this cleared up, but it's tough to reproduce when it does happen.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd5cf1b659b06bf1c88f1ca22570fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasozz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
