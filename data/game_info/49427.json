Like all attempts to be immortalized, there was a curse attached: the three were caught in an endless cycle of rebirth and death. Only one of the three could be alive at a time so as soon as one of them died, the other sprang back to life.<br/><br/><br/>You play as the warrior: a melee-based fighter who only uses weapons such as swords, spears, and crossbows. Depending on the enchantment on his/her weapon, the warrior can charge at an enemy at a high speed, pulverize the ground, and summon swords back to their hand. <br/><br/><br/>Trailer Music: The Fat Rat Infinite Power<br/>Music used in game: The Fat Rat Xenogenesis", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20770be8ba8b57dce7a942c04c8c5447.jpg", "website": "https://jkobechang.wixsite.com/gloriousnoon", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 113, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jehan Kobe Chang"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["No Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
