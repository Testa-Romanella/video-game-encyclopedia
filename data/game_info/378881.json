{"id": 378881, "slug": "ghosthack", "name": "Ghosthack", "name_original": "Ghosthack", "description": "<p>Welcome to GhostHack! This is a very small, very simple Nethack-style monster hunting game. You are Leonard, a man dedicated to clearing the house of evil.\u00a0There is an unearthly orb located somewhere in the house that is summoning a myriad of monsters. Until you destroy it, the monsters will not\u00a0stop spawning at random intervals. Once the orb has been destroyed, you must then eradicate the remaining monsters to win the game. Good luck.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS<br/>--------<br/>Use the number pad to move in any direction. If you move in the direction of a monster that is beside you, you will attack it with whatever you have equipped.<br/>Hold down 5 and press a direction to look in that direction without moving.</p>\n<p>L = Toggle your flashlight. It's incredibly dark in the house, but once you know the layout, you may prefer having your light off, as monsters can spot you better if it's on.<br/>I = Toggle your nventory. The currently equipped item will be marked with an (E).<br/>E = Equip an item in your inventory. You will be prompted for the number of the item.<br/>O = Open a door. Once a door is open, it cannot be closed, nor chopped up for stakes.<br/>U = Use an item. You will be prompted for the direction to use the item in. Using an item in the direction of a monster is the same as attacking it.<br/>SHIFT = Toggle running. When you are running you will move twice for every monster movement. Useful for when you need to get away.</p>\n<p>MONSTERS<br/>--------<br/>There are a variety of different monsters that will spawn, with different attacks, health, and damage. Some are more dangerous than others.</p>\n<p>Ghosts: A staple of any haunting. They can be hard to spot though. If something's attacking you, and you can't see it, it's a ghost. Or your flashlight is off.<br/>Hags: All manner of witches. There must be a whole dimension full of them.<br/>Mummies: Pretty dusty, old has-beens. Watch out for the Pharoahs though.<br/>Slimes: Nasty goop that gets in all the wrong places.<br/>Lycanthropes: Everything from a werewolf to a wererat and even a weretiger (the rarest ones).<br/>Demons: Some are ugly, some are beautiful, all of them are deadly.<br/>Zombies: Slow-moving undead that you must be careful around. If they bite you, they can infect you, slowly draining your health until you die. There is no cure.<br/>Vampires: The worst of the worst. Vampires cannot be killed by conventional weapons. You MUST equip a stake to defeat one, and even then, you have to get it in the heart.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, stakes are easy to come by if you get an axe or a chainsaw. Just start chopping up the doors and furniture to make handy anti-vampire weaponry!<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0Even worse, Vampires can also infect you, making your vision red.</p>\n<p>WEAPONS<br/>-------<br/>Flashlight: When all else fails, use what you have with you. Also makes it easy to see where you're going. Batteries never run out. You're welcome.<br/>Stake: You can collect these in abundance. They're the second weakest weapon after your flashlight, but these suckers will kill a vampire with one hit...<br/> if you get it in the heart. Be careful though, once you've used one to kill a vampire, it's gone. They gotta stay put or the damned thing won't stay dead!<br/>Knife: Handy stabbing weapon. You can collect as many of these as you want. Knives everywhere!<br/>Axe: Good for chopping flesh and wood alike. The second-best weapon in the game.<br/>Chainsaw: Ohhh, you're going to love this bad boy. It not only chews through monsters with ease, it also has a better chance of making more stakes out of the furniture.</p>\n<p>I've probably forgotten some things that you're going to wonder about. The combat does not get displayed in text, only in actual strikes on the screen.<br/>You will gain health by leveling up, which you do by earning XP from killing monsters. Watch your health bar, and run away if you get surrounded. Use doorways to limit<br/>monsters to attacking you single-file. Any other tips you come up with as you play, send them my way and I'll include them here.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/015e155d5083e671d812735a73617054.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wdalphin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
