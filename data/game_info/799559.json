The government decided to isolate it immediately so as to not attract the attention of other nations. Large scientific complexes were set up around the structure for Soviet military and scientific research teams to study. They learned that the structure could be a major advantage in the development of weapons. </em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>In fact, the temporality within the structure is controllable, and its interior is also modular. As a result of these discoveries, the scientific teams were able to control the structure from the outside and develop test rooms inside it. </em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Unwilling to get involved, the Soviet government decided to select a part of the population on the base of criteria, without informing them, in order to send them directly into the structure to perform tests. These tests will allow the government scientists to perfect their knowledge of this structure and to develop weapons. </em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>You are one of the people selected and are part of the expedition groups about to be sent to the structure.<br/></strong></em></p>\n\r\n\"YOU WILL BE ALONE.\"\n\n<p>EK-0 is a puzzle game where you use time to resolve enigma.
