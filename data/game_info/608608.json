In it, a key, and a small note that read:<br/><br/>\"We look forward to your visit.\"<br/><br/>Two years prior, a co-worker of hers had received the same parcel and invitation. Only he never came back. Desperate to establish her reputation at the bureau, Lauren resolved to finding out the truth behind the origin of the parcel, as well as the fate of her friend. Her investigation leads her to a dilapidated, mysterious motel hidden behind a thick fog, said to have been abandoned decades ago... <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>E</strong>xplore a sprawling, twisted 3D motel that is occupied by eerie tenants who hold secrets that could be the key to freedom. In classic survival horror fashion, explore through cinematic, fixed-camera perspective, utilizing tank controls and managing inventory --- all the nostalgic utilities you'd come to expect. As a one-man band, there were limitations in what I could implement, but paying homage to the old style of horror was something I had to give considerable attention to; details could not be compromised as I pursued a genuine return to form that I'd felt was missing in the more action-oriented turn that survival horror has taken.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q</strong>uestion the evasive folks at the Motel who seemed to know more than they let on; get the truth, dig deep for the information that someone --- or something --- desperately wants to keep hidden. I took the liberty of diverting from the original formula to implement dialogue choices. Adding conversational branches, even if the choices aren't particularly plentiful, can add much more to the immersion. <br/><br/><br/><strong>F</strong>ight your way through the dark apparitions clawing at your back, desperate to drag your corpse into the deepest, inescapable tombs that hold all souls who dared to pass through the mist and lodge at the Moonlight Motel. There's a haunting dynamic found in playing someone vulnerable and frail, which adds to the anxiety of gameplay. I spent almost a year creating a video game that pays homage to that old school PS2 style survival horror. I wanted to return that feeling of dread, vulnerability, and mystery that has been lost for some time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T03:05:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7c840bd55433b3a40d619fce9822db7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tsunami"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Tsunami"], "esrb_rating": null}
