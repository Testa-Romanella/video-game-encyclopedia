Currently there are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. And i have tested this game im 99.9% sure its physially possible. However if you do think that this is impossible please do not hesitate to message me. But if you report it because of Level 10 or a similar issue than i cna guarantee it works it just extremely hard to balance the Player on a single Pixel.</p>\n<p>While Easy and Medium are not much except that easy has 1 extra heart. but other than that both reset the Scene when you have 0 hp.</p>\n<p>The differnce to Hard mode is that you only have one life and if you die, the game will close.</p>\n<p>A helpful trick is Pressing R to reset the Scene it works on any difficulty even Hard mode.\u00a0</p><p>Take note this game was only whiped up in under a week, so dont expect too much.</p><p>The first Person in each difficulty that finishes will get a email and a Code that you can send to my email, after that i will add your Name to the Highscore list with the difficulty that you cleared it with. The current ones are still available:</p><p>Easy - Medium - Hard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/833/833394a1d3703e3703cbf7344c4a0126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Zikki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
