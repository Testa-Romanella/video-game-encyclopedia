From the whimsical to the self-absorbed, the overtly colonial to the mysterious, the experiences we imagine on other planets are all a matter of our own (situated) knowledges. Imaginary Earths are mirrors that reflect back our own prejudices, fantasies, fears and epistemologies. With that in mind, choose your crew wisely (and vary it widely) if you want to spread to the stars in style! <br/></p>\n<p>As always, thanks to Matthew Slayton for the custom soundtrack. The remaining credits are in the text file labeled \"credits\". <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a25101ea0c80f4aabb80598bce57ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kartherine"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
