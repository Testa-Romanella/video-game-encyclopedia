Getting to do all the maintenance, defending, and keeping everything in the massive dungeon on track will surely put a spin on your 9 to 5 job! But do not worry! Your salary will not increase either! You were only supposed to be sword fodder as a lowly goblin, which doesn't change much, but you now have to worry about dying and not finishing your tasks. Better use that tiny cave brain to escape the adventurers! Don't worry if you fail, goblins are oh-so-replaceable.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Patricia Necula- concept, UI\u00a0&amp; character artist-\u00a0Artstation</p>\n<p>Rebecca Pearce-Davies- concept &amp; environment artist-\u00a0\u00a0Artstation</p><p>Matt Burke- 3D environment artist &amp; VFX artist- Artstation<br/></p>\n<p>Peter Convery- team leader, programmer &amp; designer-\u00a0Peterconvery.pc@googlemail.com</p>\n<p>Alexander Norris- lead programmer &amp; designer- Website</p><p>Keri Hughes- writer</p>\n<p>Charlie Ryan- outsourced team logo &amp; voice acting-\u00a0cjryan2803@gmail.com</p><p>Samuel Pearce-Davies- sound designer &amp; computer musician- Website<br/></p>\n\n<p>The build is a placeholder right now; a playtest build will be up shortly!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Expect the final game on May 20th!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T17:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa4ea4155df200fcf81d4abe723fafa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["windrunner555"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
