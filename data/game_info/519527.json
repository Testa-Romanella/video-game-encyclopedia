{"id": 519527, "slug": "ctrlz", "name": "CTRL+Z", "name_original": "CTRL+Z", "description": "<p>CTRL + Z is a single-player, top-down puzzle adventure game. The player controls a\u00a0time-traveling avatar whose objective is to escape a series of mazes. To escape each maze, the\u00a0player must solve puzzles, avoid obstacles and use quick hand-eye coordination. Players can run\u00a0in any direction, interact with objects and rewind time by undoing their previous interactions\u00a0with objects. Time rewinds, however, only affect the environment.\u00a0Once players clear a maze, they unlock the next maze. The mazes get more difficult\u00a0as the player progresses. The game ends when the player clears all mazes. The game appeals to\u00a0players looking for a challenging casual game to master.</p>\n<p>This game is a group effort, by 5 people who spent a duck load of time to get this to work. Shoutout to Desmond for the sick UI, Stacey for the top-notch level design and documentation of our project, Vicky for the solid QA Testing and improvement insights that improved our game, and Xin Yi for the dope sound effects and visuals! It was fun designing levels and stringing this game together with you all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a5400f51093d9e65a04c591f9228ae1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brokeasf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
