Players can play solo or form teams, add friends with other online players, and chat. Teams of up to 4 people can fight and clear levels simultaneously. In team mode, the battle process, round-trip missions, mid-way supplies, NPC trading, item sorting, equipment use, vehicle driving, etc., are all real-time online.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, this game has abolished the previous pay-to-win system and now uses K points obtained in the game. K points can be obtained through leveling up and settling accounts after clearing copies, with higher levels yielding more points, especially in later copies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEverything else remains the same recipe and taste, so if you like it, give it a thumbs up!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPrimer:<br/>\r\nThe world has been threatened by the end of the world, comets hit the earth, new infectious diseases, nuclear wars, zombie crises, world wars, alien invasions, etc...

The tsunami caused by the earthquake would not have killed almost all human beings, but the carbon emissions accumulated over hundreds of years, The resulting greenhouse effect led to global warming. The glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic finally melted, and human beings finally tasted the bitter fruit they brewed... The largest tsunami in history swept across all continents, and even the roof of the world, the Himalayas, was washed away by the tsunami...<br/>\r\nThat day we came to call Judgment Day.<br/>\r\nThe world has once again entered chaos.<br/>\r\nThe wheel of history continues...<br/>\r\n----------Basic operation<br/>\r\n--- button<br/>\r\nThis game requires keyboard and mouse.<br/>\r\nCharacter Control:<br/>\r\nThe key AD is to move left and right, and the key S is to squat.<br/>\r\nThe key W is the extreme speed mode, which consumes energy.<br/>\r\nThe space bar is to jump, and the space bar is pressed to skip during the dialogue.<br/>\r\nKey 1 is empty-handed mode, key 2 switches to cold weapon, key 3 switches to auxiliary weapon, key 4 switches to main weapon, and key ~ is for cycle switching.
