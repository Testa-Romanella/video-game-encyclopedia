{"id": 316812, "slug": "game-30", "name": "New Robinson", "name_original": "New Robinson", "description": "<p>The story of the game is based on Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe\u2019s Life and Amazing Adventures. The main character of the game, very remotely resembling a brave sailor from York, ends up on an island with almost nothing. The player will have to experience all the delights of being a city dweller on an uninhabited island - to solve the pressing problems of everyday life (finding fresh water and food, fishing and meeting with a crocodile, making fire and building a house), communicating with the natives and visiting an abandoned ship. And when it turns out that the island is not completely uninhabited, save the future friend and comrade-in-arms (Friday, who, by the way, has yet to learn Russian) and try to flee by building a balloon out of improvised means and outwitting the pirates. And the fate of the poor fellow Robinson depends on the acumen of the player. Unlike most of the existing adventure games, the main character can influence each of the selected items on any active object on the screen, which makes the passing of the game much more diverse. &quot;New Robinson&quot; also includes many ingenious plug-in games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T10:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/3198a0de612a2a2665d421dcc863fca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 385, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikita", "\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nikita", "\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
