Unfortunately, due to my conflicting work schedule, I was unable to polish aspects of the game such as the art style, game momentum, scoring, and audio quality. Despite some of the game's short comings, I hope that the key concepts of the game came across well. Please feel free to give honest criticism to help me improve in all future projects.</p><p>The game was made using GameMaker Studio</p><p>\u00a0All sounds were made using BeepBox 2.1.3</p><p>http://www.beepbox.co/#5s0kbl00e03t7m0a7g0fj7i0r1w1111f0000d1111c0000h0000v0000o...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/368/368f764c92fdb9855a4f7c9c3b1eeeec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Napoleon Dynaparte"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
