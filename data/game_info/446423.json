I made it with the videolab SDK, but it doesn't actually work in the op-z app. However, if you own an op-z and plug it into your computer, it'll work like a regular PC game and send MIDI messages back and forth. I'm assuming it should also work with other MIDI controllers, though I haven't tested it yet.\u00a0Pressing play activates the more traditional arcade shooter game mode, while pressing stop switches it to a sandbox mode where you can shoot at different objects to trigger sounds.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3129b2ee74020887c523224231eb09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["yuandan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
