If the ball hits the wall and there is no target, that part \n      of the wall begins to crack, and breaks after three hits. When a ball \n      flies outside of the screen, one ball is lost. When all balls are lost, \n      the game is over. Keep an eye out for items that will help you but also \n      avoid those that will give you penalties. Keep your reflexes sharp as \n      you run and strike!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94afd9c0eafea7d3eec2d5e86d2d199c.jpg", "website": "http://www.genterprise.jp/ggusa/sports/run.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Goodvision"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Goodvision"], "esrb_rating": null}
