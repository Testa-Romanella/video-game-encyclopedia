Important thing is that the game shows individual scenario for each character.<br/><br/>As a quest game it requires a player to collect a number of items and set them together to move forward, carry out some tasks and communicate to other characters. By the way, dialogues are pretty plain and legible for users.<br/><br/>The best for last: you should have noticed it's AO rated product (18+) and there're really some fruity moments. Young boys and girls in a lake hotel, miles from nowhere \u2013 all these already feels erotic. Guys don't mind getting a peep of girls in the shower or watch some sexy pictures of their girlfriends on the Internet.
