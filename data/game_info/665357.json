If nothing is done, the Smog will become so powerful, not even a Life Bubble can combat it. All will cease to exist. Only the Smog and Impurities shall remain.\r\nYou are a Giver. Your job, as the Givers before you, is to take plant life from one Haven to another, to help their Life Bubbles grow. A tiny final beacon of hope for saving the inhabitants of the world.</p>\n<p>You, however, were chased off your path and awaken not knowing where you are, or where the closest Haven is. But your mission is too dire to give up now. Every plant has the important task of helping the next settlement grow. The fate of an entire Haven is in the little seed you're holding.</p>\n<p>So, with its help, you press on.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game was developed by an international team of 6\u00a0during the week long Women in Games Jam (in collaboration with Into Games) as part of the Women in Games Global Festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> for movement\r\n<strong>[1] [2] [3]</strong> to select shield type\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Space Bar</strong> to active shield\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<strong>Programmer</strong><br/>\r\nAlina Q<br/>@galaxylinaa\r\n<strong>Programmer</strong><br/>\r\nSabrina W\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Game &amp; Level Designer</strong><br/>Aoife G<br/>@EggstraWaffles // Website\r\n<strong>Graphic Designer</strong><br/>Ami C<br/>@amiycai_ // Website\r\n\r\n<strong>Writer &amp; Producer</strong><br/>Ave K<br/>@calamitydev_ // Website\r\n<strong>Game Artist</strong>\n<br/>Erica L<br/>@EricaLeeArt // Website\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This game uses these sounds from Freesound.org licensed under CC BY 3.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cAmbient electronic loop 001\u201d by frankum</li>\n<li>\u201dwolf-growl.wav by newagesoup</li>\n<li>\u201dbrd_hawk.wav\u201d by tec_studio</li>\n<li>\u201dAlien Ghost 1.wav\u201d by FiveBrosStopMosYT</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d9c920ad96218d36c6db38f8aa43def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ami C", "Aliinaa", "Erica Lee", "ExtraWaffles", "Calamity", "frogglingTheGreen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
