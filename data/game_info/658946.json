My team and I chose to recreate pac-man as a ninja in a dungeon. The 'first level' is normal pac-man with the ghosts being skulls, pac-man being a ninja aka Mac-pan, and\u00a0the swords are the power pellets.\u00a0In the second level it turns dark and there are still swords, but a torch and speed boots are added to help the player. The player then has to find the key and return to the also hidden door to beat the level. It was also made in about 5 days... so relax!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5db/5db1bbb59eb8a1ea0f65b86de8735982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Bkush"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
