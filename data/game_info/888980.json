Pick up the cartridge on the table, insert it into the console, and turn the console on. Use the controller on the table to start playing.</p>\n<p>Important controls:</p>\n<p>Escape/Start: Hold to quit the game.</p>\n<p>Tab/Y: Open your inventory.</p>\n<p>Escape/Select: Let go of the game controller (when held.)</p>\n<p>You can use items on object by pressing A while your inventory is open with the item selected. Pressing A on an object without selecting another item in your inventory\u00a0will use the object.</p>\n<p>The idea of this game was to have haunted cartridge that would interact with stuff in the game AND (importantly) the house you were playing the game in. You can actually look around while playing the game, so\u00a0I'm sure you can image all the different spooks you can do with that... But alas, I ran out of time, I have a game I'm trying to release on Steam at the moment, and that took precedent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5eb/5ebd68dfbc13b1e6db7bf10f20ed888f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hunter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
