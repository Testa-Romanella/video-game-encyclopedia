Most importantly we believe what went right the most was the fact that we stayed true to our game idea. We cut some things out but we didn\u2019t make huge changes that would change the core of the game completely. It stayed true throughout.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong/what problems did you face? :\u00a0</strong>\u00a0During the development process, it was hard to communicate with the others at times. We all have different schedules, and whenever we would decide to meet we wouldn\u2019t because something would come up.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How did you overcome those problems? :\u00a0</strong>We didn\u2019t meet up much but we managed to overcome that by setting tasks for each other. We each played a role in one thing and helped each other when we needed it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What changes were made and why? :\u00a0</strong>There were a lot of changes made. We had a lot of ideas that we weren\u2019t able to implement due to time constraints. That game was originally planned to be an isometric top-down but we decided to go the first-person route because we were having trouble doing isometric and we knew it would be faster doing first person. The original idea for the town was scrapped. We had planned for it to be a location you can go back to when you need to buy potions but we didn\u2019t know how to make an inventory system and we would also have to add all the code needed to buy potions. The town was only going to be used for that so we thought we could scrap it as we had no other plans for other items that could be bought from there. Two weapons were scrapped as well due to time running out. Spells were renamed and defensive spells were scrapped because the stats weren\u2019t done soon enough for us to work on adding spells that would temporarily boost them. In terms of level design, we had planned how we wanted it to look but some didn\u2019t end up exactly as planned because we didn\u2019t have the assets. Even though a lot was scrapped we all worked together to make sure the changes didn\u2019t affect the gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>What did you learn?</strong>\u00a0:</p>\n<ul><li>Plastic\r\n</li><li>technical skills<ul><li>level system\r\n</li><li>maintaining a player through scenes\r\n</li><li>Implementing Combat\r\n</li><li>Making different types of AIs\r\n</li><li>Scriptable Objects\r\n</li></ul></li><li>unity editor skills\u00a0\r\n</li><li>level testing importance\r\n</li><li>making floors, walls, decor, etc. faster\r\n</li><li>use of light sources and particle effects</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589f2c0a79d96f5b17b67523f24fee41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GCort2"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
