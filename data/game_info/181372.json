{"id": 181372, "slug": "red-shirt-engineer", "name": "Red-Shirt Engineer", "name_original": "Red-Shirt Engineer", "description": "<p>Shortly after a scientific expedition arrived at an interesting spatial anomaly, hostile ships start warping in. Without any communication whatsoever, they open fire, and target your ship\u2019s systems, and many crew members are injured. You, the enigmatic engineer wearing a red shirt, must repair the damage done to each system, and pilot the ship to safety.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get any time to write a tutorial really, just some tooltips. So here\u2019s one.</p>\n<p>W = Move forward</p>\n<p>A = Turn left</p>\n<p>D = Turn right</p>\n<p>Left Arrow = Fire left railgun</p>\n<p>Up Arrow = Fire forward railgun</p>\n<p>Right Arrow = Fire right railgun</p>\n<p>The button on the top-left of your screen will take you to see the panel that\u2019s been damaged.\r\nOnce viewing the engineering panel, everything is fairly self-explanatory. At the top, you have a selection of logic gates you can place, a tool to connect them, and a button to return to the original ship view.</p>\n<p>Each logic gate has 2 input terminals(except the NOT gate, that has 1), and an output terminal. The blue circles are inputs, the red circle is the output, and the cross above the output is to delete the logic gate. The same colour scheme applies to the panels\u2019 inputs and outputs (left and right terminals respectively).</p>\n<p>Once you click a terminal, you will start dragging a wire. You can right-click to drop it. Each input can only be connected to one output, and each output can only be connected to one input (though the panel terminals on the left can be connected to multiple terminals). Note: I have seen some bugs with this, if you connect an input to multiple outputs or vice versa it probably won\u2019t work\u2026 you might have to restart the game even ;)</p>\n<p>Remember - some circuits are connected to machines that generate a lot of heat. If these are allowed to get too hot, your circuit could get damaged!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9ce95de232ba3a775d9af0e24778c655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Noxbuds"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
