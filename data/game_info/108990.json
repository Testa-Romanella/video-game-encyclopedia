{"id": 108990, "slug": "desert-express", "name": "Desert Express", "name_original": "Desert Express", "description": "<p>In <strong>Desert Express</strong> your job is to protect your train from bandits, attempting to steal your cargo.</p>\n<p>Every train run starts with a random number of crates loaded onto your train. The more cargo there is, the more cars your train consists of and the slower it travels, requiring you to spend more time on the run and making those crates an easy target for pursuers.</p>\n<p>In addition to slower movement, having a large number of crates on board makes your train a more attractive target for bandits. You'll find that there will be more pursuers when your train is full, but as the number of crates you carry dwindles, so will the interest of the bandits: less and less of them will be inclined to join the chase.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to shoot at the bandits. Only the first enemy on the way of your shot will be killed (the shots don't pass through enemies).</p>\n<p>Your aim is to successfully protect your cargo so that by the time the train reaches its destination there are as many crates remaining as possible. Can you finish a run with a full train without losing a single crate?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Art:</strong> Kyrylo Cherkashyn (Lobstercorner)</li><li><strong>Programming, music: </strong>Taras Denysenko (terrapass)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools and resources used</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aseprite (pixel art &amp; animation editor)</li><li>Tiled (tilemap editor)</li><li>Early version of a nameless custom engine, using SDL2 library with SDL_image, SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer extension libraries</li><li>bfxr (shot sound effect)</li></ul>\r\nPostjam updates\r\n<p><strong>postjam-xmas</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The player now throws snowballs at the pursuers, instead of shooting at them with a nondescript hit-scan weapon.
