Thank you for playing and please leave any feedback you have.</p>\n\n<p>Oct. 4, 2017: Game development continues and I will have the start to a great adventure complete by this Halloween. (Follow me for updates)\u00a0 As I continue to work, it is becoming more and more obvious that <strong>I NEED AN ARTIST</strong>! I made the art in the original game , playable above, but with scope growing and my own art clearly lacking, I hope to find someone to work with.</p>\n<p>The new screenshots show something closer to what I hope to turn the game into. They are created by the wonderful\u00a0Kenney and they are great! I will continue working with them for now with hopes of finding someone to create assets specifically themed for Halloween. To give an idea of scope, my current thoughts are to have 6 towns and 5 animated characters exploring them. Seems doable but I'm open to change if need be.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you or someone you know might be a good fit. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Phil\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Originally made for #clickclickclick jam!
