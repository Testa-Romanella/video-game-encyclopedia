Try to consume every bit of land leaving nothing untouched! Advance through a series of levels of increasing difficulty. Keep your Blob alive as long as you can by consuming the planet in an orderly fashion. <br/></p>\n<p>The music of this game features a soothing acoustic guitar ambience that draws the player into the game keeping you clicking for hours as you lose track of time.
