Both modes allow simultaneous cooperative play for 2 players.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to change all the cubes to the target color while avoiding an onslaught of enemies coming after you. Keep your eyes peeled, as foes, cube coloring patterns and stage shapes get more devious each level! Look out for the rainbow discs, the most valuable asset you get, and use them to lure Coily to his demise, making the stage a safer place... for just a moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227c49c5889ddf82ba4bff3e69a9dc33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jaklub"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
