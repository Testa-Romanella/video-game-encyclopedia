The virus must be destroyed.\r\nLuckily you have oversized rolls of toilet paper, which you pinched\r\n(or perhaps borrowed) from your local bogs, as the supermarkets and\r\nmedicine stores had completely run out of stock. </p>\n<p>Your task is to drop\r\nthe toilet paper on to the cabinet, and stack each roll accurately in\r\norder to force more weight at the top. Once 7 rolls have been\r\nstacked, the weight of the cabinet will be too weak to hold the\r\nrolls, the glass will break, and the virus gets destroyed. </p>\n<p>For every successful\r\ntoilet roll stacked, you will get 300 points. If you kill the virus,\r\nby stacking up 7 toilet rolls you will get a BIG BONUS added to your\r\nscore.</p>\n<p>You have five minutes\r\nto rake in as many points as you possibly can, unless of course you\r\ndrop a roll on to the ground, which results in losing a chance. Once\r\nall chances are lost, or the time runs out the game is over. You will\r\nnot get any extra chances during play.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Programming, graphics and music by\u00a0<br/><strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong><br/>Tape turbo loader system by<br/><strong>Martin Piper </strong>and <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/><br/>(C)2020 The New Dimension<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Tape version mastered with<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/2082cfe294e3519d5ac3ca58dbf98d6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
