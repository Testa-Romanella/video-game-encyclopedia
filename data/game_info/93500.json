They face off once and for all in square to square combat, choppin' each other's bods mercilessly. They spin through the air, in an endless struggle. </p>\n<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>\n<p>CHOPSQUARES is a small two-player versus game, where each player is a square, a square with a sword on its head. Time slows the closer both squares get. If the sword touches the other square's body they are dead. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Multiplayer</li><li>Two-Player</li><li>Fighting</li><li>Chopping</li><li>Squares</li></ul><p><strong>Thank you for support!</strong></p>\n<p>The money for this game goes into helping me be alive and make more games!
