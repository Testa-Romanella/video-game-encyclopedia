Dark<br />\nMatter is after a distant land&#39;s powerful crystal, but a young fairy<br />\nnamed Ribbon attempts to save it by escaping with the gem to Dream Land.<br />\nNow the crystal has been broken, and it&#39;s scattered around the world.<br />\nTake control of Kirby and help him journey across six worlds, battling a<br />\nwide variety of enemies and challenging bosses, as he tries to collect<br />\nall 100 pieces of the shattered crystal. Along the way, you&#39;ll use<br />\nKirby&#39;s trademark copying ability to use enemies&#39; strengths against<br />\nthem. Not only that, but try combining any two abilities to create a<br />\nbrand-new one that is usually stronger than the original. Throw in three<br />\nexciting multiplayer minigames, and you&#39;ve got a package of which even<br />\nKing Dedede would be proud. Fans of Kirby and action games with bright,<br />\ncolorful graphics should vacuum this one up.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
