Grab a group of friends and have a Typing Party!\r\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: In order to play this game with friends, you will need two keyboards attached to your computer. If you're on a desktop, any two standard USB keyboards should work. If you're on a laptop, you can use the laptop keyboard + 1 USB keyboard, or alternatively use two USB keyboards.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a multiplayer game at heart and is designed to be\u00a0played with friends - however, you can practice the game single-player by competing against Mark 22, a computer controlled opponent! <em>(You do not need two keyboards when playing against Mark 22.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Face off with NINE amazing minigames!</li><li>Supports up to four players!</li><li>Configure your party: Choose which minigames you want to play, and how many points the game lasts!</li><li>Practice against the computer in single-player mode!</li><li>Two versions of the game are included: the standard version, plus the \"ARCADE VERSION\" - a simpler, shorter version that doesn't require a mouse and can be set up as an installation.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is kinda old! It was originally\u00a0built in Flash, and was only recently revitalized and packaged. Therefore there are a few technical quirks.</p>\n<ul><li>Framerate seems to be bad in windowed mode. This is likely an effect of using the Adobe AIR runtime. We highly recommend <strong>fullscreen </strong>for all users.</li><li>Letterboxing will appear on screens that are not 16:9.</li><li>Pressing ESCAPE exits fullscreen mode and can mess up inputs. Use the upper-right menu to toggle fullscreen on and then off to fix.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d842f3efc6022e082271f52127354be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holy Wow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
