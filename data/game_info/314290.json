Guide towering, tumbling fishtanks toward matching exit tiles in an increasingly frantic fever-dream of puss-based-puzzling.</p>\n<p>Sqvishy is a fast-paced action/puzzle game of visualization, forward-planning and sharp reflexes. Giant fishtanks spawn at the edges of a randomly generated grid and begin to roll... By switching the directions of the grid tiles your puzzled-puss can guide these colorful cages to matching exit tiles. For every fishtank freed you score a point, but for each one lost - either through collision with another fishtank or by rolling onto an edge - a point is deducted. You must reach a certain number of points to clear a level. There are six levels - newly generated each time you play - with exits, fishtank colors and spawns randomized. Find a level of difficulty that suits you and get puzzling!</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>Six Levels of Difficulty </li><li>Customizable Colors </li><li>Full Controller Support </li><li>Customizable Controls </li><li>Cosmic Rainbows! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f4/5f456048f9b29cb2fbb1132189626375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jamesmakesgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
