Yet, the <em>fujoshi </em>inside her awakes as she discovers his homosexuality: instead of complaining about the impossible blooming of her feelings, she decides to set him up with another boy.

It contains the following:<br/>- slight cussing (although I tried to avoid it being heavy)<br/>- mention of some teenagers' fantaisies<br/>Some more and more spoilery trigger warnings can be found here. Please, note that this only spoils the\u00a0<strong>demo content</strong> and that the main game will have many more trigger warnings; but, once again, it will always remain PG-13.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Writing, scripting, GUI: Yacine Aggoune<br/>Character Art: YuHeS<br/>Background art: good old\u00a0UncleMugen, House of Imagi Studio, Clip Studio Assets assembled and edited by yours truly<br/>Music: Dova Syndrome<br/>Sound effects: VideoPlasty, Zapsplat</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES ABOUT THE WEB VERSION:</strong> This game is meant to be\u00a0<em>donwloaded</em> and played on a computer. Playing the browser version might be laggy, and it is therefore something you should do if and only if you cannot download the executable files. Also note that the web version might not work\u00a0: a change of browser usually solves the issue (I suggest\u00a0Mozilla Firefox). Please, also note that the web version only features the demo: the full-game version, when it is released, will have to be downloaded.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T19:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec1/ec19f436b2492f051b346618fd9d09d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["chimeriquement"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
