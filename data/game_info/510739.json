Sounds easy? Yeah, but the trick is that your every movement leaves a trail behind you. If you touch it you lose. You have to jump, dash and control your speed to find a perfect path that will let you finish the level. But one mistake and you'll start from the beginning. Think, analyze and be quick then you'll succeed.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Unique gameplay</li><li>25 levels with brain blowing puzzles</li><li>Fancy graphics with neon style</li><li>Nice sfx and energetic music</li><li>Keep track of your game stats</li><li>Regular updates with new levels</li></ul>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this game is rather an experiment than a typical game. I am still working on it and would appreciate your feedback and support. It contains only 25 levels for now and some gameplay mechanics aren't added yet. But it's already fully playable and I guarantee you'll get a lot of fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:05:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bb1beea5c41efce97f837863b944e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PaulArt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
