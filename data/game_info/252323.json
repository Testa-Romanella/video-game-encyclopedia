{"id": 252323, "slug": "ghost-mystery", "name": "Ghost Mystery", "name_original": "Ghost Mystery", "description": "is scary hidden object game is divided into four levels. In each of those levels there are eight items hidden and your task is to find them all. At the bottom of the picture there is a list of the items, and as you detect them, they will disappear from the list. When you are finished, it is time for the next level, until you finish all of them and finish the game in total. You dont have a time limitation for playing the game; you could play it as long as you need but be aware that is recommendable to be faster because that way you will be able to earn more points and more bonuses. The game is challenging most because of the dark colors that are included so the items are hidden very well, melting with their background. Also you will be surprised by their position; nothing stands on a predictable place, so you should explore every corner and every place of the pictures. However good thing is that the game includes option for using a hint, so you could rely on that in case that you cant see any solution. The game has exactly four levels, so we hope that you will get to the end, without letting those sights to get you scared.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d858e7f70ea838dc8719c3864a4745c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["BHUMEET BHATT"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["BHUMEET BHATT"], "esrb_rating": null}
