The box, that is opened previously, closes if it differs from the current one. They disappear when there is a necessary amount of the boxes opened simultaneously.</p><p>There are four locations in this game. Each location has five levels. Depending on the location the number of playing facilities types increases. The necessary amount of the simultaneously opened boxes of the same type increases due to the level , while the permissible amount of attempts of correct combination reduces. Time limitation is added to the last location only. It increases due to the level as well.</p><p>The first level of every new location is always easier than the last level of the previous location. However the last level of the new location will be more difficult than all prior.</p>System Requirements<ul>\r\n\tLinux\r\n\t<li>OS: GNU Linux X64 with 3.xx Linux kernel, or later</li>\n<li>Processor:x64 (64-bit) CPU</li>\n<li>Memory: 512 MB RAM</li>\n<li>Graphics: GPU supporting OpenGL</li>\n<li>Storage: 100 MB available space</li>\n</ul><ul>\r\n\tWindows\r\n\t<li>OS: Windows Vista SP2, or later</li>\n<li>Processor: x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) CPU</li>\n<li>Memory: 512 MB RAM</li>\n<li>Graphics: GPU supporting OpenGL</li>\n<li>Storage: 100 MB available space</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tDOWNLOAD\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tPS:\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is my first game.
