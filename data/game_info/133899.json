{"id": 133899, "slug": "bomb-stoppers", "name": "Bomb Stoppers", "name_original": "Bomb Stoppers", "description": "<p>This is a game that I began developing in my final year (2015-2016) of the Game Development and Entrepreneurship program at UOIT. I am the sole developer of the game, including the creation of its art assets with an exception being the text font used in the game, which I purchased a license for.</p><p>The vision behind the game was to not only provide the player with a challenging experience, but to also provide a way to bring people together locally. The game has a co-operative mode that allows for 2-4 players to play on a single device in order to achieve a higher score together. Another way I like to describe this vision is that - if everyone is going to be stuck on their phones, we might as well have them all stuck on one phone.</p><p>The game still has work to be done. The multi-touch support isn't entirely fluent which ends up being detrimental to the effectiveness of the co-operative game mode, but I'm confident I can fix that up rather easily. I have to develop the art assets for effects such as bomb explosions, and also need to either develop more sounds or acquire licenses to existing pieces. I also intend to implement a competitive game mode to allow for 2v2 or 4v4 matches.</p><p>Presently, the game is only playable on Android devices. I hope to build the game for other mobile platforms in the future.</p><p>Now, please give my game a try! If you are not downloading the .apk file directly from your mobile device, then follow the installation guidelines provided in the download below in order to transfer the game from you computer to your mobile device.</p><p>Feel free to comment and provide critique, as your feedback is greatly appreciated. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf6552b78eb89537b49c0efe8fadbb17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GameDevBriden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
