Kill enemies quickly to get more power ups or they will become too powerful for even you to handle. Every 5 minutes enemies will exponentially get more powerful so prepare for the worst and get powerful quickly.</p><p>The assets in this game are primarily taken from OpenGameArt.org and are licensed under CC0.
