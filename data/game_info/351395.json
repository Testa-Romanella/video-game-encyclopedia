The rats are eating the grain, the rabbits are destroying the vegetable patches and the pigs are eating everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will earn currency for killing the vermin but be careful, do not kill any of the farmers live stock, because you will loose currency for killing the wrong animals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHunt and earn currency. <br/>\r\nYou will 'later' be able to use this currency to spend on bait to lure the vermin, or better weapons and upgrades to get that kill easier. <br/>\r\nSo be patient in the beginning, while you hunt with just your air rifle, and make sure you save up as much currency as you can to get those much needed upgrades.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76dc7a6f1e12c0148badfb4b9505f2a3.jpg", "website": "http://www.verminhunter.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inturn Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inturn Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
