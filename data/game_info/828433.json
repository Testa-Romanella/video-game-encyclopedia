I tried to cut corners where I could, like only having one fully animated character, and only making outlines of the platforms to save on time.</p>\n<p>I had an idea for the color theme even before the limitation was revealed this time. Luckily the limitation fit pretty well with my original idea. I still had to work all night on the final day to finish on time. All graphics, game logic, and sound effects where made during the jam period.</p>\n<p>I became pretty happy with the results this time. I managed to add a lot more polish than my previous Unity game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/152192aa092b4e494ac379c5127b1f64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kerneliron"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
