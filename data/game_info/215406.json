Characters are unlocked by walking over their icon and then equiped by walking over them\u00a0at the start of the map. All characters have different abilities.</p>\n<p>Moving with WASD or arrow keys, Aiming with mouse</p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This was my second game jam (First from GMTK). My art is still very rusty, can't make something good looking yet in a small amount of time. I needed to rush this game because of time limitation and thus I couldn't make more enemies or spawner variation, might take that more into account for next game jam. Also I tried as much as I could to test this game before sending it, but I am not yet sure if all the major bugs are out because I couldn't go through the entire game, did every part of the map in parts. Please let me know if you find anything, or have any critiques, would love to know how to better my games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/512/512d051d7f570890a2c738d50f22494e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMoore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
