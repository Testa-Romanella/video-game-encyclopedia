Shelly has been kidnapped by the treacherous Vulgaris. Escar will jump, stick, roll, go fast and slow, in order to rescue his beloved.<h3>The Controls</h3>Being a runner style game, your character is always moving forward. But you are given the ability to control how fast that movement is. Along with this core mechanic are other staple snail abilities. Abilities such as jumping, jumping after you've already jumped, rolling in your shell, and sticking to slimy surfaces. Who knew snails could posses such skills.<h3>The World</h3>Venture through 4 worlds, 40 levels, and 4 boss fights with Escar in his pursuit of Vulgaris. Each world introduces new obstacles for the player to overcome. Boss levels at the end of every world offer a unique experience and put your skill to the test.<h3>The Challenge</h3>Mastering your control over Escar will be necessary to overcome the most difficult of challenges in the game. Precision, aggression, and patience are needed in order to beat this game, let alone 100% it.
