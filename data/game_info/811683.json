He has to accompany king's daughter to a nearby neighbouring kingdom where she is planned to be married with her spouse. Unfortunately things go wrong and during the journey our protagonist loses the princess and has to find her and rescue her.</p>\n<p>The game contains only 5 levels from planned 20 and its development is currently on hold.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the game still contains around 20 minutes of content and I would\u00a0appreciate anyone playing my game and giving me feedback :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to play the game, you need to dowload both the game file and the game engine file. Then you open the game file and click a green play button on the top left of the screen.</p>\n<p>Also most of the sprites from this game are not mine, thus I am not charging any money for playing my game. I made everything else from coding to game/level design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f40cdaec9b161fd18a472709d456de7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bluemage Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
