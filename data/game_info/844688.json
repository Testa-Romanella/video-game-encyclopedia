I personally made none of the art/sounds/3D models as they were either made by my team members or downloaded from third-party sources. One slight exception is on Hospital Simulator in which the voice lines were recorded by myself and a friend and processed by myself.\u00a0In team projects, I served as the lead or sole programmer for the group. My work included the systems design, UI, AI, player functionality, etc.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T08:06:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c8cf8852018cd17dfcbf7472dd5ecc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jbeck98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
