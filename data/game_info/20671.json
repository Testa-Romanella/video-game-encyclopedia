You will use these and the resources of the planet itself to create your own light, heat, water, air and food. <br/><br/>\u2022The second phase is exploration of the planet itself: where are the other ships? Who shot you down in the first place? You will do so in a beautiful and realistically rendered 3D environment complete with dynamic interactions of light, heat, day/night cycles, and Martian geology and volcanology. <br/><br/>\u2022Third and most challenging, you need to transform the lifeless, desolate and frozen wasteland into a new home for Mankind. You will do this from scratch, using constructed tools, machinery, and Earth born bacteria and plant life carefully nurtured and strategically placed. You will create a complete atmosphere, hydrosphere, and a complex biosphere - step by agonizing step - as you fight to stave off the cold, the hunger, and the loneliness of a world that will kill you without a thought, with no one to hear you scream.<strong>Save Earth, terraform Mars.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1c/e1c99acf2d333a81412ba80b6e2efff5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vermont Software Studios,LLC"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vermont Software Studios,LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
