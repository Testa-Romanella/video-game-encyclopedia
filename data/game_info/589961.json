You check orders of each house to see which fruit they\u00a0need, collect money from treasure chests, buy the\u00a0fruits needed for each house from uncle Joe's fruit store, and deliver orders to houses. Watch out there are mean machomen-looking bandits that will steal all of any\u00a0fruits you have. But to defeat the machomen bandits, you have to buy the protection potion to knock them down. If you mess up any orders, you can go to theee Pawn shop and sell your fruits, and even your potion to make extra money. There are 3 Levels in this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>- Matt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:32:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6a42f3e69c0acd283f65b32ccdca5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew M."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
