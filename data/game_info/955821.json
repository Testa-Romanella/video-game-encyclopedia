However, because of a failed experiment by his\u00a0 distant father,\u00a0Aesop is going to grow up living those fables!<strong> Follow along to this tale for a thrilling\u00a0adventure RPG only for the Gameboy Color!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(Above is some concept art when I was brainstorming the idea.)</strong></p>\n<p>Aesop has 3 main forms in the game that you as the player must transform between to successfully finish your quest and save your little village. At times you must be a fool hardy kid with messy hair- yet once you have gotten yourself into a blunder too big transform into your Tortoise form to tank the hits. If all else fails transform into Rabbit form and swiftly carve a path for your journey to carry on.</p>\n\n<p>The inspiration for this game mock up is I tried to imagine what kind of game my childhood friends and I would want to play on our gameboys\u00a0after chess club.</p>\n<p>If you could make a game what would it be like? I'd love to hear :D</p>\n\n\n<p>I refuse for anyone to create derivative work from this concept since I may make this game one day... Thank you for understanding.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T08:54:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afec788fcf6976cc031756508e80d20d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["howdy riceball"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
