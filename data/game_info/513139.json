See for yourself.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Mostly original content, including soundtrack, characters models and animations, etc. Didn't manage to make the last two scenes in time. But 85% of the game by the play time is there. Also, a lot of resources like cat's house are in a draft state. Though, they should still work :)</p>\n<p>And I'm willing to finish this game.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T02:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fa3b755b3868875122981be949ae605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shine_111"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
