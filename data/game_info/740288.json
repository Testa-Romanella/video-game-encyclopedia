A portal had opened in the nearby area where they were and it sucked them in! When they awoke, they saw a strange entity they haven't seen before. A living fire named Firey. I'm sure we all know what happens next.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a full week mod that I spent a good handful of days making and editing together, from making custom character poses to charting every single song for all 3 difficulties, so I hope you all enjoy playing this!\r\n</p>\n<p>Firey and BFDI is made and owned by Jacknjellify on YouTube. This is a fan creation that I have had as an idea for a long while now, and thanks to Psych Engine's easy to understand creation tools, this mod was possible!\r\n</p>\n<p>---\r\n</p>\n<p>Links\r\n</p>\n<p>Source Code: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AMoR11r3F3931GNofSnFR1s-AV4FG1w-?usp=sharing\r\n</p>\n<p>Alt Download: https://gamebanana.com/mods/353427\r\n</p>\n<p>Drive Download (Outdated): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FQb2HQyJb9BFNSZoL3hO4DJjpnpNsHo/view?usp=sharing\r\n</p>\n<p>---\r\n</p>\n<p>TAGS AND REWARDS\r\n</p>\n<p>This Game is tagged  #fnf and #bfdi\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f83babd8f3a4b34a1dddf8aff2ebad48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sackboy62320 Creations"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
