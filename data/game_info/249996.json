Build with the goal of merging real-time strategy and first-person role-play experience. Easy to pick up but hard to master, with the death mechanics which leave you without your equipment each time you perish. Because of that, we allow players to construct their own companions which will help you to build bases, gather resources, protect you and your settlement.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/><br/>No aspect of the game is truly prioritized, to allow players to become experts in a specific element of the game. At the end of the Early Access stage when co-op will be added to the project, players will be able to create a true team, where they will focus on their strongest abilities, to play Penkura in their own way/style/experience.<br/><br/>If the need comes, you can take control of your own bot to travel to a hazardous environment. So you will be able to scout the area or repair your base without the risk of exposing yourself to unnecessary danger.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/><br/>Almost every item, building, machine or companion can be constructed by the player. Most of it will be made in \"MMC\" (Molecular Matter Converter) or \"CCC\" (Command Control Communication), which will provide top-down camera similar to the classic RTS games.<br/>Entire crafting and base construction systems are already made with co-op in mind. This will allow players to cooperate in creating much more complex and bigger sets of items/stations, that normally would require hours of work. <br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/><br/>Under Antarctic ice, Polish research team discovers an ancient Temple which appears to be a gateway to a new better world. <br/>The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was like a blessing for already overpopulated and devastated Earth.<br/><br/>Project \"Gemini\" was responsible for colonizing the new world, sending people through \"singularity\" for 41 years until the day when for unknown reason contact with the other side was severed. <br/>To learn what happened on the other side, a group of mercenaries was tasked with traveling through the unstable gateway.<br/><br/>You are one of those mercenaries, survive and seek answers.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a275147732e60edc6c903d8ae5cc164.jpg", "website": "http://penkura.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 437, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lionsart"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lionsart"], "esrb_rating": null}
