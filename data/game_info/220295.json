Get even more tech with recent updates which now include Late Flips, Reverts, Ghetto Birds, Impossibles, Dolphin Flips, Dragon Flips and Gazelles. Chain everything together with manuals, nose manuals and every kind of grind and slide.<br/><br/>Share And Discover Runs<br/><br/>Skater allows you to save your favourite trick runs and share them with the world.
