What this game is about, are you, as a theif, stealing stuff from houses, and avoiding detection from the house owners. You can at any time choose to take the escape vehicle whenever you stole something of value, if you haven't stolen any goods, dont bother returning, the driver wont drive. The more you steal, the slower you walk, hence, the higher risk of getting caught, and not be able to outrun the house owner.</p>\n<p>Main Menu:</p>\n\n<p>Start of the game:</p>\n\n<p>Gif as a teaser:</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>E - Interact with objects<br/>F - Toggle Flashlight ON/OFF</p>\n<p><strong>Features currently in the game:</strong></p>\n<p>- Lockpicking</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>First Door in every house, has to be lockpicked, you have to click E and wait, until the lockpicking sound has gone.</p>\n<p>- Interaction<br/>- Flashlight Ablility<br/>- Value/Weight system<br/>- AI<br/>- Doors</p>\n<p><strong>Made Using:</strong></p>\n<p>- Unity 2017 2.0f (Coded in C#)<br/>- Photoshop CS6<br/>- MAGIX Music Maker 2015</p>\n<p><strong>Play the game directly from HTML5 (WEB)</strong>: http://www.wolftek.tk/ldjam40</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6fde2c04a87a21d358be932c6287f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aske1gt", "madz2600", "Nzollner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
