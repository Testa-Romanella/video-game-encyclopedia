{"id": 22448, "slug": "final-doom", "name": "Final DOOM", "name_original": "Final DOOM", "description": "<p>Final DOOM is a first-person shooter, a stand-alone expansion for the 1994 game DOOM II: Hell on Earth.  </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Final DOOM is identical to previous games in the series. It consists of 32 levels (in PC version).<br />\nIn each one, your goal is to find an exit from the level. It usually intends finding keys from multi-colored doors and fighting hordes on the demon. The player has access to different weapons such as a chainsaw, pistol, shotgun, and rocket launcher. There are many types of enemies in the game that vary in size, attacks, speed, amount of health from zombies and imps to huge cyberdemons and skeletons with rocket launchers on their shoulders. Aside from weapons, the player can use different weapons scattered throughout the map. Some of them replenish your health, ammo, and armor, and the other gives you temporary bonuses like increased damage, short-time invincibility acid resistance or invisibility. The levels are filled with secret rooms. Finding them is entirely optional but can significantly help by giving you new weapons early or providing with items and ammunition.  </p>\n<h3>Final DOOM differences</h3>\n<p>Final DOOM is essentially a collection of new maps divided into two packs: TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment. Different level designers outside ID Software created each pack. The game is noticeable for its hard difficulty that surpasses the level of two previous games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T21:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6ccd31115c74d58edb41d0855567d00f.jpg", "website": "https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en", "rating": 4.15, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 83, "owned": 1534, "beaten": 102, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 45, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 144, "suggestions_count": 513, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 144, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC", "Classic Macintosh"], "developers": ["id Software", "Williams Entertainment", "TeamTNT", "Casali brothers"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["id Software", "GT Interactive Software", "GT Interactive", "SoftBank", "Williams Entertainment", "GT Interactive Software Europe"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
