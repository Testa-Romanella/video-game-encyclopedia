Avocado toast is amazing.</p><p>Context</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/301c18b16e7429670402e35161d42558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquma"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
