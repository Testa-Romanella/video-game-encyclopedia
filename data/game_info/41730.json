Building on the characters and world from Valve&#39;s Portal 2, Sixense created Portal 2 In Motion to provide the most intuitive motion control experience ever seen. Players use the PlayStation\u00aeMove motion controller to reach, rotate and scale objects in order to solve increasingly challenging puzzles that require creative use of motion. Portal 2 In Motion also adds new depth and possibilities to the familiar tools from Portal 2, requiring the player to fire portals at precise angles and to throw Weighted Storage Cubes with measured force. The light on the PlayStation\u00aeMove motion controller changes automatically to correspond to the color of the last portal created (either blue or orange), just like your Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:47:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f17cb77e658fe3058414c45b0097bacc.jpg", "website": "http://sixense.com/portal2inmotion", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sixense Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Valve"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
