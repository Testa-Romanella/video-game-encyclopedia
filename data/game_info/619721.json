The dark mage will see these crystals as solid blocks, helping in an ice-sliding puzzle. The opposite is true for the dark orb of the dark mage.</p>\r\nSETTINGS\r\n\"Double Dealing Illusionists\", as the name implies, is a game where you control two different characters (a light mage and a dark prophet) to descend the dungeon together. The magic the mage casts and be seen as a barrier to the prophet, and vice versa. This creates an illusional path for them to move through the dungeon safely. However, since they two share the same fate\u00a0(i.e one dies if another does), you have to help them maneuver their path so that they can avoid dead-ends.\r\n<p>DDI is a simple ice-sliding puzzle topdown game, in which you \"slide\" instead of moving. This is the biggest motivation for you to use the complementary power of these two characters to illuminate a path.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD or Arrow keys:</strong> Slide</li><li><strong>Space:</strong> Switch character</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong>: Interact with GUI</li></ul>\n<p>Puzzle-solving has never been my flair, but in this case, I took risks creating puzzles that are both intuitive and challenging (hopefully not too frustrating).
