To prevent that you are able to use giant space paddles to bounce them back into outter space. The problem is that black holes have a huge gratational pull and so the balls will always come back...</p>\n<p>Once you've bounced back the first ball enough times you can use giant canons to fire a second one, each time the balls hit a bumper you gain score points. If you manage to hit a ball with the smaller paddle you gain more of the energy used to create a new ball.</p>\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<p>Spacebar: Launch a ball\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Q/D OR A/D OR \u2190/\u2192 : Rotate the paddles<br/>Enter : Restart the game</p>\n<p>A game made in a week by CHEDAL Dorian, LAJMI Mohamed, FLEGO Lucas, ZAZOUA Yanis\u00a0and DUBOIS-VERGIAT Iris during their second year at Institut de Cr\u00e9ation et d'Animation\u00a0Num\u00e9rique(ICAN) in Paris.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c7fde78bda40f8258d0d0207d5ab2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iris Dubois-Vergiat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
