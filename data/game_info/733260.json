THE HEADPHONE SMASH SIMULATOR!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although this game is suitable available for everyone, you would enjoy more if you are a F1 fan. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Don't you just hate it when you disagree with a opinion and get told \"It's a motor race\"? Yes, everyone hates it. Even the team principals for huge teams. But the only difference is, they are not broke like you. They have the MONEY to smash headphones on their desk and get rid of their frustration, while, you, are just sitting in your home full of stress, anxiety and anger. How do you release the anger? Do you smash a headphone? YES! ABSOLUTELY! Then you realise you are not rich enough to smash those expensive pair of headphones you own. But no worries! Here is the Headphone Smash Simulator! Smash as much as headphones you want, whenever you want, however you want!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Smashing headphones is fun. Everyone agrees on that. If you don't, I will come running to your house and threaten you until you agree. Whenever you feel like smashing something, start smashing some headphones! The game also comes with a fancy little headphone counter which will help to keep a track of the plastic waste you generated by smashing headphones.</p>\n\n<p>Although, one can smash headphones for hours and hours, but it can become boring after a while. Don't get me wrong, it is fun, but it can be repetitive. To solve that very problem, you are provided with a motivation button at your office. Just give it a press and you'll be filled with determination to smash another 100 or so headphones.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this till here, and downloading the game.

I like to suffer :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7b03fd74c1e88c645e4586e3cf7a88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevBoiAgru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
