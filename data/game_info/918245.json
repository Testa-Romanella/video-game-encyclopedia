You remember everything after, too</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Have seen it flicker along the edges of your home, catch fire to everything you've ever known. Have felt it gnaw its way into your bones, watching as the last safety ship glinted starlight in the sky.</em> <em>Losing a home you had never known did not hurt as bad as losing the home you have</em> only<em> ever known. This distinction had been made very clear to you in the end.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Fear is every step you take, it is every beating heart, every conspired whisper. It exists within the hollows of your cells, in every ill-intended look cast your way. </em><em>You are fear. And they make you believe it.</em>\u00a0<em>\" </em>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You are the lone first-generation, three-star pilot of the <em><strong>United Forces of the Red Remembrance. </strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>And you will be the last. \r\n</p>\n<p>You are the only pilot capable enough to helm the UFRR's greatest mystery and secret shame; <em><strong>Acheilus</strong></em><em>, </em>an antiquated shark mecha left over from before <em><strong>The End</strong></em>. He is your only friend in the abyss of the ocean. \r\n</p>\n<p>It is a time of peace. The bitterness from the<strong> </strong><strong><strong><em>Coalition of The Last Frontier's</em></strong> </strong>abandonment has long since diluted away in favor of lucrative trade deals from space - goods that could only benefit the UFRR's longevity underseas. It is a good deal, kind, even. Generous.\r\n</p>\n<p>But you cannot help but taste the tang of deceit between your teeth. The sickly stick of rot amplifies after you spot another shark mecha circling the edges of UFRR's water space. Sleek black and glinting metal - a convincing imitation of the Remembrance's mechanics. The problem with this: you captain the only shark in the entire ocean.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"Humanity took to the stars and left us for dead.\"</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>From This Mouth That Bleeds</em></strong> is a retro-mecha cyberpunk created with Twine that focuses primarily on choice, the never-ending landscape of loss, and something about the monsters you keep. \r\n</p>\n\n<p>- A fully customizable MC including gender, appearance, and sexuality.   - Mechas, time travel, and a war that never ends.</p>\n<p>- a setting both placed underwater and in space\r\n</p>\n<p>- the end of the world \r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Ophelia - </em></strong>The only daughter of the <em><strong>Coalition of The Last Frontier</strong></em>. She is largely a question mark, her name whispered around like a demon of old \u2014<em>Void Jumper</em>\u2014 but other than that, you don't know anything about her, nor do you care to. \r\n</p>\n<p>So why do you keep seeing her in your dreams? \r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Jonah </em></strong>- The lead doctor of <em><strong>Base Alpha</strong></em> and only other first-gen similar in age to you. He's got kind eyes and gentle hands, always looking to be your friend, despite your stark opposition. \r\n</p>\n<p>You've known him your whole life. And it's this familiarity that allows you to say that underneath that smile of his lies a darkness\u2014one you cannot begin to understand.</p>\n<p><em>Dev Blog| Playlist</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T08:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd199abefc6cbe7c228dd59f5b1c7aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blood-teeth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
