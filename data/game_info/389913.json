In this 2D vertical platformer, you play as Gobbo the baby bat, escaping from the witch's belfry. Your magically powered echolocation scream blasted the bell out of the belfry and knocked out the witch, and her tower has started collapsing around you. Free your friends from her overgrown tower by sonic-blasting their cages open. Your score will increase the more monsters you free, but be careful: the more you sonic-blast, the more the tower will break!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:26:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da0010ac01b014364c33d8350b8bfff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GingerPixels"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
