It's like Game Of Life but physically accurate gas from cells/particles.</p>\n<p>Use different tools to interact with the simulation. Increase speed or size of the field, but it will use more resources, mainly GPU.</p>\n<p>Gasomaton uses WebGL 2.0, so only Google Chrome or Firefox.</p>\n<p>Github project: https://github.com/radulov/LatticeGasWeb\u00a0feel free to contribute.
