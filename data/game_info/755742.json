I made this game in a week to compare my knowledge from my past game project: Backgrounder. This was just to spur me to complete a project.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to find a predetermined and random code that has been selected. You input a guess by selecting tokens and submitting them. If you get a black token in response to the guess, on the upper right side of the screen, you got 1 token (not corresponding to the position of the token in code) in the right spot. If you get a white token you got a correct token, but not in the right position. You get only a set amount of guesses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f4826f738900e231f65d0c6a16290529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AboveAverageProgrammer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
