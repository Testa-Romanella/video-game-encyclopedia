As the couple packs his things, the mother provides a map. What does the map hold? Only she knows.<br/><br/>During his time at the foster home, the boy would sing to help reduce his sadness. It helped that his mother left him with written lyrics for several songs to keep him busy. However, it just wasn't enough...<br/><br/>A week later, the boy escaped the facility. He spent years aimlessly wandering and traveling to all kinds of places. but was unsure as to whether or not he has been following the map correctly.<br/><br/>Exhausted and in deep despair, the now-teenage boy rests in a cave for the night. At this point, all he could think to do was close his eyes...<br/><br/>After getting to open them again, he finds himself in a labyrinth filled with puzzles and obstacles standing in his way.<br/><br/>The story of Mystery of Melody Memorial has officially begun...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mystery of Melody Memorial is a video game for Windows (from XP all the way to 10!) computers and Android devices. <br/><br/>The game is an original title inspired by the likes of Paper Mario (particularly Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door) and PaRappa the Rapper, with elements of other titles such as Undertale and Mario &amp; Luigi possibly in the mix. <br/><br/>This is an adventure title with an imaginative world and an emphasis on storytelling and world-building. However, whereas RPG games would feature turn-based battles, Mystery of Melody Memorial will instead have \"song battles\". The adventure will be three to four hours long, but elements of replayability grant players the opportunity to discover more than the mainline path could offer. Side-quests allow for more to accomplish, which in turn unlock secrets that would otherwise remain unseen. There will also be an Arcade mode unlockable after beating the main game; the mode will consist entirely of all the major \"song battles\" from throughout the adventure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The story and character interactions will feature a blend of genuine emotion and genuine humor. The world contains a diverse cast of characters with unique personalities. From eroding in a swamp filled with shady activity to playing at a driving range with a sensei, the journey can be fairly unpredictable. After all, even with music playing a significant role in this lifetime populated by elaborate characters, it's still a dangerous world out there...especially if you don't know where to turn...", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abce705f0c24577785dc9e47fa7c936c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Silberman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ryan Silberman"], "esrb_rating": null}
