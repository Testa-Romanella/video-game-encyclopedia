I'm Saruh and I'm currently working on a new Visual Novel, I`m not a native English speaker so please forgive any my poor grammar...<br/><br/><strong>Angelica's Temptation: From the beginning:<br/></strong><br/><strong>The story and plot:</strong><br/>This VN will tell Angelica's story, she's a housewife married for ten years with Henry.<br/><br/>But their relationship is no longer the same, Henry is working too much and they haven't had sex for a long time, but the main issue in this is there's a side of Angelica that she never revealed to her husband, she has a\u00a0psychiatric disorder named Nymphomania with which she has been struggling since her she was a teenager, which caused her to experience many things before she was married, things which she never told Henry about, and one of those things is that although she still has herself under control, some people have the ability trigger her disorder, especially Aria and Mark.<br/><br/>Aria is Angelica's best friend and one of the few people who know about her disorder and also the person who witnessed the \"real\"\u00a0 Angelica,<br/><br/>as for Mark, he's Henry's best friend which is divorcing and \"need\" a place to \"lay low\" for a while but the main problem is that Mark also knows about Angelica's nymphomania and that is the point where the game start, will Angelica's succumb to the temptation that both Aria and Mark represent? Or will she succumb to her disorder? Her destiny lies in your hand (Yes, the one you won't be using to fap, unless you use both...LOL)<br/><br/><br/><strong>What changed and what not?</strong><br/>The main diference on this VN to the previous on is the story, the story changed while the main plot remains the same, I added new characteristics to all the main characters, this version also brings many new characters like family members, people from Angelica and Henry's past, and many other things, but I don't want to give any more spoilers than that, this new project brings the same 3D model for Angelica which received a high approval on the last project, but all the other 3 protagonists of this version have new models, I'll still be working with Ren'py and Daz3D, and the VN will still follow the same format where your choices always make diference and with many paths which will be there for you to choose from, I like to give every player the most control over Angelica's choice as possible but since the time between updates and the content amount are variables that count, not just to the patrons but to me as the developer as well, this time there will be many paths that might lead to a premature game over or closing \"romantic\" paths with other characters, but this is something you will see once you play the game after the introduction.<br/><br/><strong>What will this VN bring in terms of Adult-Content?</strong><br/>The main fetish in this VN will be NTR, Cheating, Cuckolding, Interracial, Lesbian, Threesome and Group-sex, but not every path will lead Angelica to cheat on her husband, there will also be path where you can lead her to try and save her marriage without making Henry into a wimpy cuckold, one of the fetishes I'll be including this time is the possibility of making Angelica into a cuckquean in order of not losing her husband, but also the possibility of cheating in secret or maintaining a \"romantic\" relationship with two or more character in the story.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a Free edition of the game if you're interested there are other editions with much more content on my patreon page\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86e/86e865f7a1318f0bffd7cd3f755bef49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Saruh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
