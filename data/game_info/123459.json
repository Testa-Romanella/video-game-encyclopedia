I found it a bit fun to play, so I uploaded it here.</p>\n<p>You play as a mortar. You shoot tanks. Tanks explode when you shoot them. If a tank makes it up to the left side of the screen, you lose.\u00a0Each day there are more tanks to come, try to keep 'em away as long as possible.</p>\n<p>There are two powerups which you may find useful: blue ones cut reload time by a half, and red ones instantly explode all the tanks on map. The game is endless, possible bugs are everywhere.</p>\n<p>Controls are simple:</p>\n<p>Left/Right to change shooting angle.</p>\n<p>Up/Down to change shooting speed.</p>\n<p>Space to shoot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b30acb45ab845f15c6bca46b1ab9ea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["silent_lesch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
