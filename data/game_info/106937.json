Up to 6 players can play. Players will sort themselves into two teams and as one team tries to grab fish to take home, the other team tries to hurl snowballs at them to freeze them. If all of the penguins freeze before they can bring a fish home, the teams switch roles. First team to bring fish home 5 times wins the game!

We are very proud to have our game chosen by our peers, teachers, and program coordinator as the best game for this semester's Sprint Week.

For this Sprint Week, we had 5 days to create a physical version of Ice Ball and a digital version. We decided that half of our team would design each version but we all met up every day to discuss design, playtest, and help each other.
