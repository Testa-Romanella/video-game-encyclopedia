Everything you see is out of a \"giant perspective\". <br/>\r\nYou can explore the city by walking or using the controller and pull yourself through. You are also able to slide the map up and down and adjust the volume.     <br/>\r\nIn the city itself there is lot for you to discover. Besides there are 12 hidden Scenes (+1) and one that can be explored and will tell you one explicit story.<br/>\r\nAttached above the controller there is a \"Timeline\" that shows you what scene in the chronological line you have already found. <br/>\r\nAs soon as you are in front of one particular scene the controller should \"vibrate\" and fill out the timeline.<br/>\r\nWhen you have found all 12 Scenes a new one will reveal. Find it again and the story of Evia is solved! Or has it just began?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T03:20:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c49d02e323ae0437dfeccbc70942a8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raumkapsel Animation"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Raumkapsel Animation"], "esrb_rating": null}
