The island will constantly shift by rising out of or falling into the water,\u00a0 and there's a\u00a0risk of fires! Your job is to place the resources used by the inhabitants, they go away fast though so stay on your toes!</p><p><strong>If you have issues with scaling on the Mac or Windows version, please download the version for Mac or\u00a0Windows.

An abundance of both will grow houses\u00a0that in turn increase\u00a0the\u00a0population.
