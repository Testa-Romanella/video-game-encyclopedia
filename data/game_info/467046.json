You will have to avoid\u00a0projectiles spawing around you or destroy them by pointing your gun at them . However, you willregulary lose one of your control, like the possibility to go up, down, left or right. These controls will go away and you will have to move to it if you want to recover them. If you want to\u00a0go in a direction where you no longer have the control, you will have to take \"FlipController\" located\u00a0around the map, to inverse your controls. Be careful, these objets will inverse ALL your controls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make the highest score, good luck !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c6/4c65f9466633cffb6ef346e84451cf9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bubbsy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
