It's pretty early at the moment but people seem to enjoy it so we thought we'd throw it up on here. </p><p>Currently you can play seven sports with all the rules you love from the real games. Yup. Total simulation. Honest<br/><br/>Some of the sports in there aren't very good. Some are alright. Sorry about that.</p><p>We're working on adding more sports and some other fun things. We think we're on to something special and we hope you do too.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>---</p><p>WebGL is just Keyboard controls currently. The game isn't really meant for Keyboard, but it appears to work so go for it. Remember to fullscreen though.</p><p>PC Build was tested with DualShock 4 and 360 controllers.</p><p>---</p><p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/></p><p>Action: Bumper - S/K/5/Down</p><p>Power: Trigger - W/I/8/Up</p><p>Special: Stick-in - no keyboard support<br/></p><p>Restart: R on keyboard - PS button on DualShock 4</p><p>Accept: X on DualShock 4 - B on 360</p><p>View Variants: Triangle on DualShock4 - X on 360, 2 on keyboard</p><p>Menu - M, PS button</p><p>BONUS - press '1' or '3' on the menu.
