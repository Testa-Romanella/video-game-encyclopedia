During the game, they will ask you questions and the player will have to choose an answer from a small selection of different answers. Depending on you answer them, their reaction will change and this will lead to different endings. For example, if you answer them respectfully then the denier will be more likely convinced by your arguments. However, if you insult them then they will get annoyed because you are insulting them and are less likely to be convinced by your arguments. As a group, we thought this was a really interesting way of approaching the game jam. It was much better than our original idea because it turned out a lot of people had the same idea.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse to click on answers</p>\n<p>Esc key to go back to main menu</p>\n<p>Game Created by Rubber Ducks on Fire</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Adam Tedder - Lead Programmer and Team Leader</p>\n<p>Arthur Kass - Lead 3D Modeller</p>\n<p>Sohail Sarwar - Level Designer and Programmer</p>\n<p>Lewis Rean - Modeller and Level Designer</p>\n<p>Benjamin\u00a0Simon - Narrative Designer and Programmer</p>\n<p>Nathan Li - Programmer and Level Designer\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7b/b7bb4eac8f33fd2e3f0481299445cdbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RubberDucksOnIce"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
