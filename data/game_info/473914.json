All credit for the game goes to it's original creators, Nago Mie, Aster, and Vienne. Without these 3, I would not have made this in the first place.\u00a0This demo takes place in the 36th episode of the series. This is also still a work in progress, as there's still much left to translate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0de/0defb53118455301b4afe68db3a66907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oersted of Lucretia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
