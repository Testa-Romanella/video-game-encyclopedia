{"id": 90875, "slug": "date-or-die-prologue", "name": "Date or Die: Prologue", "name_original": "Date or Die: Prologue", "description": "<p>A brand-new, completely reworked demo for <em>Date or Die</em>, first shown at PAX East 2017.</p><p>In this demo, you'll see the opening moments of the game, where you'll be introduced to the cast of characters, find your match, and get an overview of the stakes involved. In addition to containing a completely different script from the original demo, this prologue also features new sprites and artwork for all characters, introduces one or two faces you might not have seen before, and gives you a clearer idea of what to expect when you first open the full game!</p><p>Please note that this opening section will have some differences in the final product: namely, on a first playthrough, it is normally impossible to match with The Host, and some lines of dialogue have been changed to make this section stand alone more clearly. Our save/load screen also isn't implemented yet, and fonts aren't final. It's still a work in progress, but we hope you'll find something to love anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/3299217d3941a273ed076fddd00e025a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
