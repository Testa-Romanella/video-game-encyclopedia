Short and fun, should be a small experience with some action and challenges. If you played the game, please leave a comment detailing what you liked and didn't, any feedback appreciated!</p>\n<p>The game is currently quite short - if there is a positive reception I can extend it with new mechanics and guns and levels.</p>\n<p>Update: pistol and SMG now have spread, prevents pistol from being OP and makes the SMG feel more like an\u00a0SMG. SMG ammo size has been increased to compensate.</p>\n<p>If you want to follow my development progress make sure to hit follow @ali3ndev on twitter ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T16:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54ea8775213e41036c104fff2bf59caf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ali3n"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
