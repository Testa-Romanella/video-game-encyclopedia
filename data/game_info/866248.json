In Pinball VERSUS you can play against your friend in VERSUS mode or with your friend in CO-OP mode. Game does not have AI or multiplayer via internet so you need to actually have some real friends! Or be skillful enough to play CO-OP mode alone! I hope you will enjoy my little game!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Some tips:</strong></p>\n<p>Controls are displayed before the match! But if you really want to know:</p>\n<ul><li>- Player 1 controls flippers with <em>A</em> and <em>D</em> and skills with<em> left control</em>, <em>left shift</em>, and <em>caps lock</em>.</li><li>- Player 2 controls flippers with <em>left</em> and <em>right arrow</em> and skills with <em>right control</em>, <em>right shift</em> and <em>enter</em>.</li><li>- plunger is being controlled by <em>space</em>.</li></ul>\n<p>Multiplier in the middle gives you 1 point more after scoring a goal for every 1000 points!</p>\n<p>Every player has 3 skills to use! They can help you score a goal, defend yourself or just make more chaos!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T14:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dffdfb83122111e75c3600a48d4b29e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["qbco"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
