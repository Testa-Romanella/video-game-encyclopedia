If you&#39;re a novice, switch on the improved driver and racing aids to race for fun - or turn them off for a full length GRAND PRIX experience if you&#39;re a FORMULA ONE professional. FORMULA ONE 06 features the ability to Network Play between PlayStation 2 and PSP. This means players can now compete online across platforms to see who the fastest FORMULA ONE 06 racer is. In other words, if you own the PlayStation 2 version of the game and your friend owns the PSP version, you can still compete on the same circuit!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-05T12:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/770/7703e3f79c9e9a339cb4bc6dc988b13d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PSP", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Sony Studio Liverpool"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["SCEE"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
