This is an 'XL' version of my popular mobile game 'Bing Bong'. I have added/changed a variety of things to make it more suitable for the Steam platform and improved a lot of code and features based on knowledge gained since I originally made it. I have been learning to make games by making games and love creating small-yet-solid arcade games with simple mechanics. <strong>Please expect 'Bing Bong XL' to be a small, re-playable, arcade score-chaser game where the only basic goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlock a handful of cosmetic skins for the character.</strong> I greatly appreciate feedback and will do my best to ensure support for my games. Please contact me through Twitter, My Website, or the forums if you encounter something wrong with the game, something misleading on the store page, or you just want to say hello. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read this; I really hope you enjoy playing my game.<br/>Adam Nickerson - Nickervision Studios", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e565eebd3b022399a98c0fef2bf7167.jpg", "website": "http://www.nickervisionstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 67, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nickervision Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nickervision Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
