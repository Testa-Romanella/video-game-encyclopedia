One player can use the keyboard, which has the following keybinds:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Left stick</li><li>Arrow keys - Right stick</li><li>Q/E - L2/R2</li><li>Space - A</li><li>Shift - B</li><li>Left Control - X</li></ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> -\u00a0project is very much a <strong>work in progress</strong>; previous (non-public) versions of this game took a <em>rather liberal</em> approach to copyright and very little thought to accessibility, resulting in this having around 70% of the minigames and 20% of the music variety of the \"full\" version. There has also been very little testing on screen resolutions other than 1920x1080 and 1600x900, so some minigames may display weirdly on significantly different resolutions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T03:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee9d0c76590941b52e8d8a85e71f829.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoNotCar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
