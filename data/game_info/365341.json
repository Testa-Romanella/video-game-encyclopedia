A computer voice talks to you and gives you instructions. She tells you that you were found in a coma. The simulation is designed to revive you.\u00a0<br/>Who are you? How did you get here? Can you survive the simulation? What is this machine that is trying to revive you? Why is it trying to revive you?\u00a0<br/>All you know is that you have to place the blocks on the correct pad to get to the next simulation.\u00a0<br/><br/>What is this game?<br/>This game is based on the forced perspective mechanic popularized by another game that is yet to release. This game is made by a single person over several months of prototyping.\u00a0<br/><br/>Developer's Note:<br/>Forced Perspective is when objects maintain their size in your field of view. Depending on the obstacles behind the object, you can resize it by moving forward or backward. This is a puzzle game. It is my attempt to implement Jonathan Blow's Mechanic-Rule-Consequence-Puzzle method of puzzle design. You decide if I have succeeded at it. I've tried my best to make the mechanic as puzzling as possible. Playtesters took around an hour and a half to play through the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a18762f9a9072687135a245a49fc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["omeys"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
