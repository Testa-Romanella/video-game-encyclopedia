I have finally got a working leaderboard and began trying to think of ways to improve upon this idea and make it unique, fun to play, and a great way to pass some time. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated, both good and bad. I am an engineer during the day and an indie game developer at night.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T07:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0e908ccb207561f0bc0e75d22c00ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Razormate"], "genres": ["Sports", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
