Each level of Tartarus is a massive puzzle, and at the end of each level is a message regarding humans that will become very important at the end of the game....<br/><br/>Is how the full game would go, in this level(The only level) it's just a portion of the tutorial and immediately after the tutorial the puzzle difficulty increases. It's a short design to see if moving room pieces would make a feasible game puzzle game where the entire level has switches that are connected together.<br/><br/>Goodluck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cdb0344694adc0db97fced57ee94522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["awkcarange"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
