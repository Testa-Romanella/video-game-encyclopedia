My game for Ludum Dare 45.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Description from the Ludum Dare page:</p>\n\n\n<p>OKAY, so it's 2 minutes before deadline. It's been quite some time I haven't worked so hard on something (still did a few LoL games during the week-end).</p>\n<p>## What's this game<br/>It's a card game. Fight creatures, gather resources, craft cards. Yup, as simple as that.</p>\n<p>## Big Takeways<br/>It was hard. Like, very hard. It's very, very much a system game, with a lot of intricate elements. It's absolutely what I wanted to do though, because I usually do more narrative games, or simple puzzle games, so I underestimated the difficulty. As a result, there's a lot I couldn't do, since I just got to the point of a kinda playable state 30mn before the deadline.</p>\n<p># Content<br/>The content is... poor. It's very frustrating, because building the system was obviously the hardest part, by far, and now that it's built, adding content is a lot easier. (Not adding bugs in the process would probably be a bit more challenging, but I hope the system is overall pretty safe.) In a card crafting game, you'd expect to... be able to craft a lot of things, right? Well, too bad, there are only 3 different bonuses available. Would I have had two more hours, I may have been able to add maybe 1 or 2, and just that would have exponentially raised the amount of possibilities. But well, it's 48h, no more, that's the fun /o/<br/>I still managed to multiply the variety of enemies by 9 during the last half-hour. (Ok, there are only 9 enemies, and 3 different sprites in total. DON'T BE MEAN.)</p>\n<p># Polish<br/>It's... dry. I love polishing, doing small feedback and FX everywhere. I couldn't. I hope there still is some fun in there.</p>\n<p># Sound<br/>Uh, that one hurts a lot as well. I love composing music, and doing small sounds. There is... no sound in the game x_x</p>\n<p># Visuals<br/>It's exceptionally poor as well, but at least there's nothing surprising about that for me. I'm a programmer. It's programmer art.</p>\n<p># UI<br/>Damn, thinking the UI for such a game was quite a challenge. I lost a lot of time just trying to figure out how to present the elements in a readable way that could be understood. I think the result is ok-ish?</p>\n<p>(Btw it's now 10 minutes after the deadline, am I an outlaw for writing that now? Oops 11 minutes! Well I don't have anything more to say right now anyway, so I guess I'll try to take a screenshot or two, and... go to bed x_x)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:03:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/5613e72caf117f5239e29b9c33707e4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grhyll"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
