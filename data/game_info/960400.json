The protagonist was just a regular young man from Tallinn, but after dozing off on a train commute he wakes up a completely different person in far-off Japan.<br/><br/>The main character's name is Maksim Laas. He is a simple guy from Tallinn, leading the most ordinary life with its own ups and downs. Though, admittedly, the latter have lately been somewhat more prevalent for him.<br/><br/>After breaking up with his ex, the world has lost its usual colors for Maksim, and his life quickly grew into gray, dreary, and inescapable routine. At least that was what he thought...<br/><br/>Because something unbelievable happened without warning: the moment Maksim dozed off for a second during a commute, he suddenly woke up in another country... in someone else's body!<br/><br/>From this moment onward, the hero will have to live several unforgettable days as Akira Kojima (no relation to THAT Kojima) and make acquaintance with some very charming girls. Perhaps this little summer adventure will alter the protagonist's fate? Or is there more than just his future that is at stake here?<br/><br/><h3>Key Features:</h3><br/><strong>A love story where your choice affects the characters' destiny!</strong><br/>A narrative full of humor and drama where your decisions influence the rest of the story.
