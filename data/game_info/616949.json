{"id": 616949, "slug": "a-pearl-in-abyss", "name": "A Pearl in Abyss", "name_original": "A Pearl in Abyss", "description": "<p>A pearl in Abyss is an RTS tower defense game with puzzle aspects involved. It's kind of like the game of Plants vs Zombies, but unlike PvZ in this game, we can not place any item randomly on any cell. Item placement has to follow a systematic arrangement as dictated by the jigsaw puzzle.</p>\n<p>Use your ability to mold the Jellyfishes that spawn in proper order, and\u00a0arrange them to prevent Fish Bandits to get into our territory and take away our precious Pearls.</p>\n<p>On the bottom slots, you will find the jellyfishes being spawned for you. You will be able to identify them with a unique Jigsaw piece. Then try to drag it out of the slot and place them in the grid. This is how you form your defense line.</p>\n<p>Jellyfishes that connect to one another can form a cluster. The bigger the cluster, the greater the defense value; but at the same time, it becomes\u00a0a bigger target\u00a0and thus, very vulnerable.\u00a0If two jellyfishes connect to one another, the resulting cluster will be treated as one individual entity.\u00a0Thus, destroying one jellyfish in the cluster will destroy the entire cluster and all its pieces.</p>\n<p>So while playing the game you'll realize that not just connecting each jigsaw piece to one another and making one big cluster is the optimum approach, but sometimes keeping the individual pieces separate will lead to victory.\r\n</p>\n<p>And with that, have fun using\u00a0all kinds of strategies and slap em Fish Bandits one wave\u00a0after another.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:34:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21d/21df72878c0631fb7ec6968e6221d8a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["StrivenStudio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
