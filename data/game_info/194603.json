Thank you guys. </p><p>Gameplay:</p><p>Your goal is to survive the duel with your counter-part (you in red). <br/>The only way you can defeat him, and he can defeat you, is to touch the button, which will cause a tile to explode, hopefully its the tile your enemy is standing on. </p><p>What's unconventional about this one-hit-one-kill weapon? You don't get to choose the tile to blow up, in fact it could be the tile you're standing on. </p><p>Click on tiles to move to them (only 1 tile distance) <br/>Click the 'touch' button to blow up 1 tile. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8bc1086e4e9559a147bb6459004d958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["parityb1t"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
