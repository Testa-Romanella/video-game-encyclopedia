{"id": 81916, "slug": "mahjong-7", "name": "Mahjong!", "name_original": "Mahjong!", "description": "This is a traditional Mahjong game in which you play against 3 players. You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game. <br/><br/>Each player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized. <br/><br/>If the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player's claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.<br/><br/>Refer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game. <br/><br/>As few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it.
