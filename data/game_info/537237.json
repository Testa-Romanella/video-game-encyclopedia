This armour has varying weapons, stemming from an energy sword to energy cannons. Your job is to defend your command ship from the overwhelming wave of space pirate ships that are inbound to eliminate you and your vessel. How long can you survive the wave?<br/><br/>This is also a stand alone game from the main game which is also in development called PATROLLIN'. Also because it is in development things will change over time.<br/><br/>Because this game is in some way tied to the main game the controls will be very similar. There are four controls on the right control being shield, energy sword, Grab/hold and projectile weapons which change depending on the power up you grab. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381504fd3ea89e51fe87199f72677c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["neochilds"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
