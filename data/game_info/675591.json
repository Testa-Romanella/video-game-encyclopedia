Oh no, it is in a crappy unstable state.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you brave enough to get to the bottom of the mine?!</strong></p>\n<p>BEWARE: Mine is extremely unstable. Build <strong>supports</strong>\u00a0regularly. Watch out for the sand worms. Did you know that you can kill them? Restore old <strong>pumps </strong>to drain water out of the mine. Protect pipes from pumps to the tank if you don't like drowning yourself.\u00a0You can also\u00a0<strong>reinforce</strong> your supports. Reinforced supports are great against the sand worms and other dangers you will meet down below. Use them. Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong> Arrow keys for movement and digging.
