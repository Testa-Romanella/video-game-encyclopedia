They must traverse the forest and find the exit while avoiding waking up evil Tree Ents that will \u201ckill\u201d the player if they get too close to the player. The player will have to recover for a time if they are hit by a Tree Ent. Players that are \u201ckilled\u201d by the Tree Ents just faint and respawn at the beginning of the last checkpoint they passed over. \\<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Robbie Carrington Jr. - Project Manager/Programmer</p>\n<p>Dane Byrd - Game Designer, Technical Art</p>\n<p>Jesse James Lord - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Gabe Ortiz - Lead Programmer (Part-Time)/ Programmer</p>\n<p>Kota Matsuo - Programmer</p>\n<p>Tyson Cazier - Music</p>\n<p>Sam Polanco - Sound Design</p>\n<p>Madeleine Lee - Level Design/Programmer</p>\n<p>Raphael Kahn - 3D artist</p>\n<p>Nikita - 2D Artwork</p>\n<p>Jared Farney - Supporter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b169c3330269bfec3b84b28c4000587c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["akarficus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
