But the rats are fast and clever, so you have to be fully awake to be able to catch them.</p>\n<p>If life was just a rat play, it would be a little too easy, don\u2019t you think? That is why the dog was created. And the dog does everything to stop the cat from getting its juicy meal.</p>\n<p>When you make progress in the game the cat will meet other enemies too: ghosts, the giant mushroom, the bat dropping bombs and the awful chain monster. The cat has to solve some tricky problems to find its way through the obstacles and to catch the rats.</p>\n<p>The story goes through the mountains and grasslands to the caves of darkness and back to the light. If the cat is fast, strong and clever enough it will find the treasure.</p>\n<p>+ Play, earn coins and open extra features (faster cats, extra lives)<br/>+ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>\"Cat Rat Dog Race \u2013 The best game app on Google Play\"<br/>http://www.intellectuapp.com/2016/03/cat-rat-dog-race-best-game-app-on.html#.VwU...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:05:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf9a5807ccae873ab0dfb9f1ee86c8c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["mustanaami0"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
