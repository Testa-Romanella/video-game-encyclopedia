You must quickly repair each reactor before the whole plane explodes. The engine I used to make it was Game Maker Studio and I focus on the mechanic of movement.\u00a0If any reactors are damaged for more then 10 seconds then you lose. To repair them you must move around with WASD and hold SPACE until they are fixed. You get a point for each reactor you fix. Have fun and thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/865f612b0ad2c66620056d23ccb3a744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["72Milk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
