In order to save her mother, Maeve should use her powers and collect \"ancient nails\", located in the spheres, which give powers to the ancient god, demon \"Vachi\" .</p>\n<p>This is a very special project for me. I've been working on it since March. Game contains psychological atmosphere, car mechanics, gameplay mechanics, such as note collecting, shooting and note reading. If you are interested in lore, read notes carefully and watch your back, because great \"Vachi\" is watching over the village.\u00a0<br/>Enjoy the short, creepy adventure of Maeve.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T16:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/308793f6e51d3ef0b75a98283bb83d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
