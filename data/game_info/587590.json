Well, it is really easy, I don't know anyone who hasn't reached it. I bet you can climb it in a couple of minuts too. You just have to use LEFT\u00a0and RIGHT ARROWS to move and press or hold SPACE to jump. You see, easy controls. It could be a little bit dark at the beginning, but this shouldn't be a problem for someone like you.
