Features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic JezzBall-style gameplay</strong> ---\u00a0balls bounce off each other and move only diagonally, just like classic JezzBall.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Three different speed settings</strong> to customise difficulty.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Tiny, unobtrusive graphics</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Micro Mode</strong>\u00a0- The game only occupies a fraction of your\u00a0screen real estate, and can even be displayed in half size on high DPI displays, making it perfect for discreetly playing at work or while watching something on your computer.</li></ul>\n<p>Currently I only release mac binaries, as that's the only platform I play these games on. There is no reason why they should not work on other platforms however. They are written in Rust and have a dependency on C libraries SDL2 and SDL_gfx. I don't think there would be any issues compiling for Linux or Windows, but I can't support those platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T04:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22d/22db7aba3de5393c4bb62cef7bb413e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Liam O'Connor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
