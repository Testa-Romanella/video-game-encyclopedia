Badly emulated UNIX prompts? Terrible voice acting? <br/>If any of the above catch your fancy, you might like \"The GOSH signal\", the latest techno-noir thriller game from the author of such previous classics as \"Dinosaurs must Die!!!\" and \"Cancel Christmas!\" <br/>Please note, when you get to the Lab area, the signal analysis is not a joke. To progress you really will have to bust out a calculator (or a computer program) and get solving. If anyone does this I will be astonished! <br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours as my entry into  Ludum Dare 27.
