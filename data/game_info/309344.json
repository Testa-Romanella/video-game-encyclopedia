To dismantle a panel, you\u00a0will have to take out bolts, screws and wires with the left button of the mouse. Actions will include spinning valves, pulling levers and cutting wires. </p>\n<p>The robot will defend itself by sending homing missiles !\u00a0Your hitbox is your mouse pointer,\u00a0so try to dodge them while working your way to the robot's brain.</p>\n<p>The game is very short ! It's only 20 seconds. We made it for a school\u00a0project where the goal was to make a bunch of these in groups of two and combine them all together.</p>\n<p>Made by :</p>\n<p>Art :\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/guacamool/</p>\n<p>Code :\u00a0https://twitter.com/Pandanym</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b4/6b4c0feedca3b6813cd4b59626163d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pandanym"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
