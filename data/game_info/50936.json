If you prefer you can join a private table with additional rules like \u201cKnocking\u201d, \u201cNo Jokers\u201d, \u201cCyclic Laying\u201d or any combination of the available custom rules. Play Rummy the way you like it.<br/><br/></li><li>SOLITAIRESolitaire is the world famous casual puzzle game. But what seems to be a quite lonesome activity on other platforms is a multiplayer experience you shouldn't miss out. Every player will receive the same set of cards and the one to solve it in the most efficient way wins the game. Take some time and consider your move. In the end, this move can separate the losers from the winners. And if the standard game is not your taste, try some custom rules, for example \u201cTurn Three\u201d, \u201cRelaxed\u201d (all cards revealed) or \u201cJokers\u201d. Or give a try to \u201cEasthaven\u201d, the hardest Solitaire variant we could find.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>MAU-MAU (CRAZY EIGHTS)Who doesn\u2019t know it, the game with which you bring your friends to the boiling point? Your opponent places a Seven? Bad for him, you also have one \u2013 draw 4 cards from the stack, my friend. Mau-Mau (Crazy Eights) has always put your friendships to a test but also bound them even more. At the Palace of Cards, you will meet new and old friends as alike. Don't like our default rule set? Play with \u201cJack on Jack\u201d, \u201cIdiot Mau-Mau\u201d, \"Nines Switch Direction\u201d, \u201cExtra turn on Ace\u201d and many more. We don\u2019t really care, as long you have fun. We promise you will.<br/><br/></li><li>SKATThe pub classic is famous, especially in Germany. This game has received the highest score for any card game on boardgamegeek.com and there is a reason why. Strategy and tactical thinking are required if you want to take on the ladder in the Palace. The standard tables follow the international Skat tournament ruleset but you also can try our custom rules like \u201cContra and Re\u201d, \u201cRamsch\u201d and many other famous variants. Join a club to discuss and learn with advanced players or analyze your games in our replay feature. You can always improve your skills by keeping track with your statistics or talk to other players to get the best tips and tricks. So, take your cards and join a table!<br/><br/></li><li>SHEEPSHEADIf you love Bavaria this game is for you. As the ancestor of Skat, Sheepshead is the favorite card game of Bavarians and Franconians and is perceived as cultural heritage. It is regularly played with the Bavarian or Franconian card deck, which look very different to regular card decks. This tradition adds a unique flair to the game. Thus it fits perfectly that Sheepshead features a whole lot of mostly funny pearls of wisdom like: \u201cSchene Leit ham scho oiwei schiache Kartn\u201d. Well, you could try to translate this (and fail) but you also could join the game and ask a real Bavarian. Take your cards to the hand and play up!<br/><br/></li><li>DOPPELKOPFDoppelkopf is a trick-taking card game with a twist. Four players compete against each other in teams of two, but the teams are unknown at the beginning of every round. Every card exists twice and the players with the queens of clubs are playing together. Only when the first queen of clubs has been played, the second player knows his partner and can start to give him hints with his cards. Can you identify your partner fast enough before the game is lost? But don't let your opponents deceive you...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ade/ade1cecaf0169b937a001387f8978396.jpg", "website": "https://www.spiele-palast.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 129, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spiele-Palast"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Spiele-Palast"], "esrb_rating": null}
