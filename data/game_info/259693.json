Apart from that, and with some editing for brevity,\u00a0<strong>every word in this game is real</strong>, and was taken from the messages I\u00a0genuinely did receive. For the first few days following the attack my phone was almost unusable, and this game quickly ramps up in speed to reflect that. The messages within the game are a very small sample of the thousands of messages I\u00a0received.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is named after this genuine message that was slid under my front door within hours of finding out he was missing:</p>\n\n<p><em>Sorry To Bother You </em>is part of an ongoing series of works dealing with my experiences, and was preceded by c ya laterrrr and The Loss Levels, both of which are playable online.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CREDITS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Produced &amp; programmed by\u00a0Dan Hett</p>\n<p>Design:\u00a0Ewan Brock</p>\n<p>Audio:\u00a0Ciaran McAuley</p>\n<p>Written by:\u00a0ten of thousands of\u00a0people, unwittingly</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>SOURCE:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was built quickly using the amazing\u00a0PhaserJS.\u00a0 The compiled game build can be downloaded on the links below, the full source is available on Github here.
