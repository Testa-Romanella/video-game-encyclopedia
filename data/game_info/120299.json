Created in less than 48 hours at Exile Game Jam 2015, this 2D rendered neo-noir adventure game is set in the green fields of Sj\u00e6lland, Denmark. <br/><br/>Shockingly, despite its overall cheekiness, the title doesn't just rejuvenate the game jam games genre, but instead becomes its metaphysical equivalent. Mette Game is a quest that puts you in the role of Rune Drewsen, a game jam host with a special taste for mystery, marooned in a mysterious boarding school, where Exile Game Jam takes place twice a year. </p><p>Mette Game is unique for encapsulating the Exile spirit into a game that made all of it's creators happy and none of it's players sad. Haunted by curiosity and suspicion, Rune investigates local game jammers in a noir setup, trying to find the prodigal rottenness in Denmark.</p><p>It's a special experience and a joy to look at for everyone that ever attended a game jam. </p><p>Featuring a gripping story and memorable characters based on real persons attending the jam, the Mette Game will have you second guessing your humanity, leaving you haunted and disturbed by the choices you made.</p><p>The player interacts with the game environment and objects using an on-screen cursor.</p><p>Credits:<br/>Jeppe M\u00f8lg\u00e5rd (voice)<br/>Martin Mathiesen Kvale (sound)<br/>Michael G.
