The hunter is unable to fight alone as he needs his familiar to boost his strength and speed. Be careful though as the darkness gains speed along with you and your familiar.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a05th official Brackeys Game Jam. Please remember to leave a comment on if I should expand on this idea and where you believe I may improve it as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cdc4d08c3c7b5c1651b332a012b3f76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DarkAngelZxZ"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
