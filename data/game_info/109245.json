Made partially to distract myself, I wanted to create something that could act as stress relief while also providing some hope.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThroughout this election we have heard a lot of hateful and harmful things;  many people have been told they are worthless, useless and hated.

Unfortunately, we can't change this result, but we can come together and support our community to make sure everyone is doing OK.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI choose these quotes because they are, in some sense, reassuring and hopeful. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIf you have a nice quote, tweet it to me and I will add it in :)  \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t@erikaverkaaik\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t \u2764 <br/></p>\n<p>\"Cartoon Pop\" by unfa (\r\n\thttps://www.freesound.org/)<br/>\r\n\t Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\thttp://creativecommons.org/lic...</p>\n<p>\u2764<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb3e0f5b44898e92952a34cdd1b92b85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erika Verkaaik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
