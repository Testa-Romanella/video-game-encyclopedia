It uses the Bitsy engine. The game is about my spring break trip to Florida my junior year of college. The game is an interactive story.</p><p>For those of you who live under a rock, spring break is defined as, \u201ca week\u2019s vacation for students in the spring, typically at Easter.\u201d Spring break is a time where students can get away from their school-work and responsibilities before the end of the year. For most students, it\u2019s a time to relax on the Florida beaches or ski in the Colorado mountains. Some students get a little wilder and head down to Mexico for some fun in the sun. This story takes you to the sunny shores of Panama City Beach, Florida. We spent 6 days on the beach; smoking cigars, drinking cheap beer, and having a good time.</p>\n<p>Spring Break is more than just an escape from adulthood. It\u2019s a time where close friends become even closer. After spending 12 hours driving down, 144 hours within twenty feet of one-another, and then another 12 hours driving home; you learn a lot about each other. For better or worse, it\u2019s an experience that almost every college student will experience at least once in their life. This is my story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/361/361de9ff0d71dd586ce50cdb4a2d2890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Breton Ballas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
