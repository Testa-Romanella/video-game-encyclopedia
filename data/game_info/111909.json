Well they leave a right mess.  But if you know what you're looking for and can avoid the active defence systems, killer droids, crazy alien troopers and deadly toxic substances and radiation then you can make a lot of money. Thankfully due to galactic law all battles or giant conflicts with class 1 or higher weapons have to take place in the Dead Zone. That's right the one ringed by black holes. But hey kid have another beer on me and go back to your immersion booth, you'll live longer!\"</p><p>SalvageRL_PC04 is an improved version with more derelict derelicts and pipes and drones, have fun!</p><p>The webplayer and SalvageRL_PC03 is my entry build to the IndieDevMixTape jam on http://reddit/r/indiedev</p><p>Manged to add in missiles and a basic ship upgrade system.</p><p>SalvageRL_PC02 is an updated versions of the game with bug fixes/minor updates.<br/></p><p>SlavageRL_PC01.zip is my entry in the 7DRL competition, using Unity.</p><p>Keys: wasd, Mouse Look, LMB/RMB, i, space, ctrl, qe, rf.</p><p>Note: I am still working on this game for the #IndieDevMixTape see reddit/indiedev for details.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b4d3f31509744ea27cfe93e07d3154.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arowx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
