There seems to be problems with the location that not even our technician; Luce, can diagnose. Hopefully we can sort these problems out...\"</em><br/><br/>It's July 2016. Bob had just decided to take his close friend up on his offer to bring him back to the diner he helped him to create, as no one else really wanted to take the night shift. What Bob didn't know is that someone else may know the secrets that led him to stray away from the location in the first place. Deep secrets that originate from his very past, leading to that very moment. Bob intends on finishing what he started at this diner, even if that other person has intentions to stop him. Even Bob knows that whatever happens over the course of this week, there won't be a chance to go back to how things were before...<em><strong><br/><br/>-This is a Five Nights at Freddy's fangame i've been working on since very early 2018. This is a project that's went through MANY changes since it's inception, and I hope that it can finally put the original first Horde game to rest, once and for all. This is for the people that stuck with me since the very first Those Nights at Yortusin's, and this game will pay close homage to all of my projects before this in some way. This is the final version of The Horde 1 that I ever intend on making, so i'm really taking my time to make sure this game is what I want to finish this concept with.-</strong></em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T14:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6efc28198fcedcec25a03c0aa1fd651c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YORTUSIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
