Also wanted to have the key you need to press change with the corresponding note.\u00a0 Oh well maybe next time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made all the art and music assets. except font\u00a0https://www.1001freefonts.com/</p>\n<p>Tools</p>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<p>Aseprite</p>\n<p>Waveform Free</p>\n<p>3 min timelapse of the dev:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:53:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["VortexB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
