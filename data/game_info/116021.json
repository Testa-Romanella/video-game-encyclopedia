The theme was \"reborn\".</p>\n<p>You play as a wicked man in the last 24 hours of his life, trying desperately to turn things around before he kicks the bucket. With each card that's drawn, another hour passes, so the game only takes a few minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>Each card offers you two choices, which will effect your three stats (time, money, and karma). The objective is to maximize your karma before your time reaches zero. At the end of the game, you will be told which animal you were reborn as, depending on your final karma score.</p>\n<p>Updates:</p>\n<p>v1.1 - Replaced animal images with higher resolution ones, fixed a couple of spelling errors and small bugs, and added cheeky ending messages. First release for Mac OS, Linux, and Android.</p>\n<p>v1.0 - Initial release for game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaa9634f34b041d33973f8419ae241a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["TimboFimbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
