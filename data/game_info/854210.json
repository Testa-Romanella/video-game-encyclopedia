You have to charge each jump with more or less force to beat the game without dying ; the less jumps used in a level, the better gets your rank.</p>\n<p><strong>You only need a mouse to play</strong>, or a touchpad. To jump, press left click, and aim with the mouse !</p>\n<p><strong>This game has been made as a submission to the Godot Wild Jam #49.</strong> The given theme was\u00a0<em>Unstable</em>, and I tried to validate the\u00a0<em>A Blast From the\u00a0Pastel\u00a0</em>wild card. I tried to design a game centered around unstable platforms, but I couldn't develop one of the core mechanics I had in mind, so I do realize the theme isnt as central as it was gonna be, but I decided to keep working with what I had, as I found the game to be fun.<br/></p>\n<p>GWJ#49 has been extended for a week, but I don't know if I'll be able to work on the game during this extension ; so even though the game is online, it may be updated before the end of the jam.</p>\n<p>Jumping Slime is the first game I fully made from scratch all by myself ! I am a designer more than a developer, and I'm not an artist, but I hope you still will be able to enjoy this. Everything present in this game is original resources I personnally made this week, <strong>except for the font, which is the Light Pixel-7, by Style-7.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Design / Development / Audio\u00a0/ Graphics :</strong> Eric LAMAISON</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce70112f2d0116ef27e883de8c092d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kikopu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
