Built together in about 4 weeks with our team learning how to use Unity. This game is currently a prototype but functionally works. We hope you enjoy this project, it was fun to make \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>Taking place in the far future, San Francisco was leveled in a major catastrophe! The city got rebuilt to be bigger, better, and more modern making use of new technology, The city got renamed to Neo SF.</p>\n<p>Neo SF was a perfect lax\u00a0technological paradise! Utilizing the future of technology to build a futuristic city only one could dream of. In one fell swoop by a mysterious group, the city got leveled again and left in ruins.\u00a0The local government felt it was too much hard work to clean up and rebuild Neo SF, so they decided to just leave it as it. They built a giant plate above the ruins and left the ruins to crumble. They built a new city above called Neo SF-2. Similarly designed as before, but more security was around the city to keep an eye on who could do wrong.</p>\n<p>Neo SF-2 was attacked by the same mysterious group and left in ruins again. Neo SF-3 was built above the ruins of the two cities who are left to crumble. Neo SF-3 is a perfect safe paradise. Security personnel and cameras on every street corner. The most advanced technology for the police to stop any illegal activity. The populous was safe as they lived in a perfect paradise with no worries.</p>\n<p>2 best friends, Laura and Cyril\u00a0were just minding their own business when they got singled out and thrown down to the bottom level left to die for not conforming to society built in Neo SF-3. They now have to fight their way up back up through the ruins of Neo SF and Neo SF-2 to make it back home to Neo SF-3.</p>\n\n<p>Controls\u00a0(The game has keyboard and Xbox controller bindings, I HIGHLY recommend playing with a controller):</p>\n<p>Action - P1 KB/P2 KB/Xbox (both player 1 or player 2</p>\n<p>Move player - WASD,\u00a0Arrow Keys,\u00a0Left Stick</p>\n<p>Attack - C, Comma, X</p>\n<p>Sprint - V, Period, RT</p>\n\n<p>Source Code:<br/>https://github.com/Sindiewen/Project-Neo-SF-3</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><p>Me and my teammates who helped make this project a thing:</p>\n<li> Rachel Vancleave - Director, Lead Game Design, Writer, Lead Engineer </li>\n<li> Milo Cespedes - Music and Sound design </li>\n<li> Justin Ino - Game Design </li>\n<li> Steve Han - Art/Animation, Gameplay Engineer </li>\n<li> Todd Elkins  - Art/Animation, Gameplay Engineer </li>\n<li> KiraSergeyevna Ugai - Design </li>\n<li> Anna Bolkhovitina - Design </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:50:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2489853d1e9ecc45bd22349e0018c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rachel Vancleave @Sindiewen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
