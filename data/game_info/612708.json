You have wandered into a dilapidated spider infested castle with only a slow firing musket to defend yourself with (bring a bayonet next time!) Can you survive the relentless hordes of foes? Or will you capitulate to your fate like all the others before you.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 20 hours for the 4mb game jam! A alternative Godot web build will hopefully be available in a couple of days. I'm really trying to run with this whole indie game dev thing so if you have a spare moment please leave some feedback!
