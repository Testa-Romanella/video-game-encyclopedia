Eventually the Evil Masters were repelled, but, as seen in <strong>QUOD INIT EXIT IIo</strong>, during their retreat, Huenison and his companions happened to pass by planet <strong>Suinio</strong> and decided to cause trouble there as well. Having witnessed the Evil Masters' cruelty, the <strong>Pemkians</strong> decided develop the defense training program that <strong>SkillGrid</strong> is part of. In <strong>MAH</strong>, years later, the danger came from the <strong>Apocalypser</strong>, the weapon that had been developed against the Evil Masters and that the <strong>Purifiers</strong> activated to destroy the Earth. Finally, <strong>KOG</strong> assigns a new task to the hero who turned the Apocalypser off.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T12:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5e4d6a02a483592c2f0719b439d943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
