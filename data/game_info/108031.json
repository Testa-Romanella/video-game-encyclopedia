Duplicate or detonate your units in order to achieve victory!\r\n\r\n<strong>This game is still under Development! </strong>There are bugs, placeholder graphics and all of that good stuff. You should still be able to play and (hopefully) enjoy yourself with this unique and challenging real-time-strategy game, though.\r\n<p>What you need to know:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Use the left mouse button to turn your creatures into eggs. Eggs split into two creatures after a while.\u00a0</li><li>Use the right mouse button to detonate your creatures. That deals damage to enemies.\u00a0</li><li>Your creatures are not vulnerable to enemies, but your eggs are.\u00a0</li><li>Kill all enemies in order to win.\u00a0</li><li>Press Space to pause the game. You can still detonate and duplicate your units while the game is paused.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Advanced stuff:</p>\n<ul><li>The Alt Key can be used to speed the game up.</li><li>At the top you can see a bar that fills up over time. When it's full you can select an upgrade. It fills up three times as fast if you don't have any eggs on the screen.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Here are some additional Buttons you can use in this build:</p>\n<ul><li>Esc = End Game</li><li>R = Restart Level</li><li>N = Next Level (Cheat)</li></ul>\n\n<p>I document the entire creation process of this game on YouTube. Here is how the game looked when I\u00a0got started:</p>\n\n<p>In order to find an art style, I\u00a0created 4 completely different looks. After that my little YT community and me simply picked the best one:</p>\n\n<p>In case you're interested in either my game or game development in general, I recommend you check my Channel out. ;D</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_p_9arduPuxM8DHTGIuSOg</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/JonasTyroller</p>\n<p>Now have fun playing and leave a ton of feedback!
