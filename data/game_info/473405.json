It's Angel vs. Devil themed, hence the idea of \"Conscience\". In this short gameplay experience, players must attempt to tag each other to win.\u00a0A player wins by filling up their tag meter first. The meter only starts to fill when a player is not tagged, and pauses once tagged.</p>\n<p>This game was produced in a two day Game Jam by a group of five students\u00a0at the Sydney AIE Campus. Our theme was \"Playing both sides\". We took this quite literally with the Co-op feature, but also played with the idea of going back and forth between good and bad conscience decisions (this steams back to the Angel vs. Devil theme, and the tagging mechanic).</p>\n<p>The team:</p>\n<p>[Designer] Hannah Aird<br/></p>\n<p>[Programmer] Michaela Taweel<br/></p>\n<p>[Artist] Mika Tokutake - www.artstation.com/mikatokutake<br/></p>\n<p>[Artist] Xavier Manieri - www.artstation.com/xaves<br/></p>\n<p>[Artist] Scys Sang - www.artstation.com/scys-sang<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T06:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed4583f5656eac3eab66622b05c1a38a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hannahkateaird", "XAVESAU", "Mika Tokutake", "khaela"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
