Both DLCs expand on the base game\u2019s locations, characters, combat, and systems, further expanding on the Rangers\u2019 mission while in Colorado.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Expansion Pass contains:DLC 1 - The Battle of Steeltown \u2013 Available June 3, 2021\nThe towering factory complex of Steeltown manufactures all the tech that keeps Colorado running and the Patriarch in power\u2014trucks, armor, weapons, and robots. But deliveries from Steeltown have stopped cold, and all the Patriarch is getting from Abigail Markham\u2014Steeltown's leader\u2014are excuses. When he sends the Rangers to investigate, they find the place is a powder keg with the fuse already lit. The workers are striking, bandits raid with impunity, and nobody is allowed through the gates, not even on the business of the Patriarch. Without help, Steeltown could crash and burn for good, and take Markham with it\u2014but maybe that's just what it needs. The Rangers will have to decide that for themselves.\n\nDLC 2 \u2013 Coming Summer 2021\nThe second expansion for Wasteland 3 will also include a new location, characters, challenging combat, and Wasteland\u2019s signature focus on player choice and consequence.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T03:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95d0d7ad4743948094deda3bbcc9ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InXile Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["inXile Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
