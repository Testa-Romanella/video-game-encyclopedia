{"id": 750357, "slug": "azusa-999", "name": "Azusa 999", "name_original": "Azusa 999", "description": "<p>Azusa 999 is an RPG Maker adventure game (\u00e0 la Corpse Party or To the Moon) developed in 1997 for the classic Japanese PC-98 personal computer. It&#39;s a heavy emotional story about suicide and an otherworldly train\u2026 among other things. It&#39;s quite unlike anything else \u2013 a flawed diamond, forgotten by time \u2013 which is why I decided to translate it to English over two decades after its original release!</p>\n<p>For ease of use, the game comes bundled with a pre-configured PC-98 emulator \u2013 just run the program, and you&#39;re off! If you&#39;re on Mac or Linux, or if you want the full 1997 experience, you can set up a PC-98 emulator (like Neko Project II) and plug in one of the disk images offered.</p>\n<p>The game has an immensely interesting backstory \u2013 it was created in a particular niche of Japanese indie game history, which has barely if at all been covered in English. To learn about it, read the translation&#39;s foreword, written by yours truly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T23:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7cafa7607f7451a0ab468dbfb4d9f925.jpg", "website": "https://obskyr.io/azusa999/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
