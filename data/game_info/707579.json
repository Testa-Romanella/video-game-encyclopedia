For each Horizontal row and Vertical column you have the information of how many consecutive cells are painted black; for example, a clue \"H: 5 3\" means that in the current row, at some point there are exactly 5 contiguous black cells, then after one or more white cells on the same row there are 3 other consecutive black cells.<br/></p>\n<p>The inputs (in terms of the NES controller) are:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li><strong>D-Pad</strong>: move the cursor; can be held to move faster</li><li><strong>A button</strong>: toggles a cell between painted and clear (can be held for broader painting)</li><li><strong>B button</strong>: toggles between crossed, temporarily marked, clean (idem)</li></ul><p>On the emulator embedded on this page, use the <strong>F key</strong> for the A button and the <strong>D key</strong> for the B button; controllers can (probably) be used as well.<br/></p>\n<p>If a row/column is correctly filled, the clue will have a small check mark.<br/></p>\n<p>If you manage to solve the puzzle, I recommend scanning the picture with your phone, then the title will make sense \ud83d\ude01<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:52:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/787/787c5d18f7ea68da90ddaf461cb152d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wendel Scardua"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
