Why don't you come join us?\r\n<p>Our teams' entry into this round of Ludum Dare's game jam is called **Dumb Ways To Dive**. We've tried to make a more humorous approach to the competition this time, especially since we had trouble coping with the theme. Your goal is to rescue your friend with a peculiar name, who has dived to the bottom of a lake with no chance of getting back up. However, be aware of what is lurking in the depths!</p>\n\n<p>We've tried to add as many details and gimmicks to graphics, dialogue, characters and sound as we could possibly fit in - resulting in the last few hours being extremely stressful because we were still encountering game-breaking bugs, especially with our WebGL version.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game as much as we enjoyed making it - even though we may not have picked the most original idea for the given theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>@der-finski (Coding) \u00a0</p>\n<p>@jonas-michael (Coding) \u00a0</p>\n<p>@hanna-knop (Art and Animations) \u00a0</p>\n<p>@odyze (Coding, Art and Animations) \u00a0</p>\n<p>@c42 (Music, Sound and UI) \u00a0</p>\n<p>@MelonFace (Coding, Dialogue and Art)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:07:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UOT Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
