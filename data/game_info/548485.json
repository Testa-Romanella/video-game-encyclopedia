You can only see the spike in the radiation of the moonlight. The less live you have more distance you can see.</p>\n<p>All the game art and code are made by myself during this game jam.</p>\n<p>I spent more time in-game art than programming so there might some bugs and I make this game simple. Your score and live will be automatically reset if you die.</p>\n<p>This is the first time participating game jam. This is the first time I developed a game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Press any key to start</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Space double-time to double jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T05:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287072a436299f020f31eef2af30ae12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NexTech"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
