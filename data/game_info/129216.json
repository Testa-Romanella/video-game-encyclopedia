Down in Somerset I've heard people are going around\u00a0pretending to be archaeologists once they hear of things like this,\u00a0digging them all up, and selling them on the black market.\u00a0They\u00a0should be in the county museum, for everybody to see.\" Jack\u00a0certainly wanted the coins somewhere for everybody to see, but had also\u00a0heard that along with the fake archaeologists wrecking his fields, the\u00a0real ones would also appear, with camera crews in tow and turnip loving\u00a0presenters, and be digging trenches all over his farm searching for\u00a0buildings and the like - and he didn't want that either! \"You\u00a0should get 'em all up out of the ground yourself as soon as\u00a0said\u00a0Jon, \"then the museum can get them, and nobody will need to dig-up your\u00a0land\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye I'll get\u00a0right to it said Jack...</p>\n\n<p>This\u00a0is Jack's last outing in the world of single-screen maze games, this\u00a0time based on Pac-Man with a little influence from\u00a0Lock'n'Chase.\u00a0It began life from the question that all such games involve collecting\u00a0objects and dodging the monsters, but what if the monsters collected\u00a0the objects to? And what if that undid all the good work\u00a0you'd\u00a0done trying to build up your score?</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong>\u00a0- \"<em>Everyone's favourite 8-bit farmer is back in his latest (and last)\u00a0single-screen affair, completing Bob Smith's trilogy of games quite\u00a0handsomely.
