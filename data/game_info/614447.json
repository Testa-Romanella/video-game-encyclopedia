It is powered by both ursina (game engine panda3d backend) and pygame (SDL2 backend) written in Cython (Python &amp; C/C++) . This game is a personal vendetta. Take it how you will. Don't care. I don't like Biden, nor that woman, who took pride in locking up black men for no reason. So this is my anger manifesting itself into my craft. My game engine is called black dawn, as it should fit my anger and need for vengeance, and my engine should reflect how powerful it is. Though it's not really a game, it's a tech demo. But to move you use the standard W,S,A,D and to turn you either use the mouse, or left and right arrow keys, and to shoot is either the mouse button or either of the control buttons (LCTRL &amp; RCTRL), you press the escape or the ALT+F4 buttons to close it out. It demonstrates random map generation, skybox (also random), items don't pick up, you don't die, you have to shoot the doors open, you don't lose ammo, and overall, don't treat it like a game. it is a tech demo (a 2d one at that) so here is where we are at. Special thanks to stand alone coder, for the raycasting tutorials, and assets are I assume from the original doom plus some of my custom work (LOL). Note* you can find the stand alone coder on youtube, raycasting, python etc. But the instructor is Russian, so he's speaking his native language, so turn on closed captions, and pay close attention to the source code. This is a tech demo so not a full game, just mostly for portfolio and to test my export features from the black dawn game engine. Feel the RAGE!!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2ff5994b672a65042986baff30cbe40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anutech Technical Resources"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
