I am very slow with game development as I do all the roles - coding, art and music. This was definitely an improvement from my last gamejam try. I don't think I was very efficient with the coding as I had 99% coded everything from the ground up - not sure if this is the case for others. I wanted to push myself harder in this jam with more ambitious art quality in this amount of time, trying to have a more unique concept and decent controls that don't feel too stiff. You can finish this game in a minute or two by the way. I used GameMaker: Studio to code, Pyxel Edit for art and FL Studio to make music.</p>\n<p>All in all, really worth playing once, unless there is a speedrunning community behind this game. A nice one time play for the experience, \u00a0and perhaps one more play to admire a world created in 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Perhaps if I had a team this could've been something really good. I kind of enjoyed the game for what it was and I was left hungry for more. Hmm... If it were even more\u00a0complex and if there were more levels would be the thing that would have me surpass many/even more entries in overall quality. \u00a0Well that's all for now. Good luck, all.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art, music, coding and testing: Bing Soy</p>\n<p><strong>Third party credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Basic platformer code which I heavily modified for my own use - Source: Shaun Spaulding</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Array script that allows for easy 1D array declaration - Source: GMLscripts.com</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Free 8 bit Sound generator - Source: bfxr.net</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>And as always, thanks for playing.
