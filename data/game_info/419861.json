We only had just over one week to work on it so it was fairly rushed. This game is a high score game where the goal is to defeat as many enemies as you can before the player is defeated. The player defeats enemies by jumping on them, however if enemies jump on your head you will be defeated and loose points. Each time you defeat a wave of enemies more will spawn in there place, with each wave summoning a greater amount of adversaries.</p>\n<p>The mobile version is still buggy we will try to fix that as soon as we can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T04:09:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PyrotechnicCake"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
