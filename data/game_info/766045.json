Earth is toast, and you\u2019re the Exploration Lieutenant for the very last Mission to Planet Kepler-22b.\r\n</p>\n<p>Can you find the resources you need to keep the base from breaking down? Or at least\u2026 delay it?\r\n</p>\n<p>Can you discover what happened to colonies 1-12?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\nGather Resources to Keep Your Base Alive!\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nTraverse the Alien Planet in Your Car!!\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nExplore 3 Different Biomes!\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDiscover All 12 (Other) Colonies!\r\nAvoid Alien Monsters!\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nRead Tons of Story!\r\nHang With a Big Cast of Characters!\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Randomly Generated Worlds - Non-Zero Replayability Value!\r\n</p>\r\nMeta\r\n<p>Although this is a jam game, all code, assets, and music were created from scratch (compo rules):\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Code:</em>\u00a0bkelly\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Art:</em>\u00a0kristinamay (in Pixaki)\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Music:</em>\u00a0kristinamay (in Medley)\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Writing:</em>\u00a0kristinamay + Fletcher (thanks for the help!)\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks a bundle for giving our game a try - we worked so hard on it and are excited to see what you all discover on Kepple-B!\r\n</p>\r\nWhoops!\r\n<p>There might be a few things we didn\u2019t get a chance to finish or polish as much as we\u2019d like. If you get a message on-screen that doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>totally</em>\u00a0make sense, that\u2019s why. It\u2019s definitely playable to the end (there are several different endings!), but any \u201cTODO\u201ds you see (hopefully you won\u2019t!) are an artifact of our being quite ambitious with this game.\r\n</p>\r\nWHERE\u00a0TO PLAY\r\n<p><strong>You can\u00a0play the game here!
