If any of your Popular Support, Noble Support, or Military Support start the day at -20, you lose! Similarly, if your Suspicion ever reaches 100 you lose as the king's Inquisitor manages to catch you!</p>\n<p>Each day and each night\u00a0you can select an action to take from around the areas of the city using your mouse, which will raise one resource and lower some others. Some actions require you to spend either\u00a0Gold\u00a0or\u00a0Energy, and you can only take those actions if you have enough of those resources.</p><p>Finally, at the start of each day you'll receive a random event.
