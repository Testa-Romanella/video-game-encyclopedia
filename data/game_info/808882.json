Household items like boxes and chairs want to bring you down by pummeling your dust bunny home into dust. You choose to use the healing power of nature to combat their onslaughts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Point and click your mouse to move around the map. To use the items you collect along the way, use the buttons that appear on the left side of your screen. Buttons will only appear when you have an item available in your inventory.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>BUTTONS TURN BRIGHTLY COLORED WHEN ACTIVE. THEY ARE A LITTLE BUGGY.</em></p>\n<p>When a button is active, click on the map to plant/heal.\u00a0 Click a button a second time to cancel placement. If it doesn't work, keep clicking! Hover over plants to see how much health they have remaining.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAME PHASES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Each game phase ends automatically when the timer in the upper left corner of the screen expires.</p>\n<p><em>MORNING</em></p>\n<p>Gather seeds and plant them around your house for protection!

Attacks come from all directions, so be prepared. If your house gets hit, it will knock the attacker back, but it won't do any damage.
