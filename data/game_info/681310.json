Processors will execute the tasks they are assigned to, but each time they execute an instruction, their heat meter goes up!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pay attention to each processor's heat meter and prevent them from overheating. You can lower the processor's heat levels by giving them time to cool off or treat them to refreshments. You can see for yourself what happens if you let any of them overheat, leaving ControlU with less processors to work with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you keep these processors at work?\r\n</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n<p>Meet the characters in the game~ (May or may not be accurate to real life references)</p>\n<strong>ControlU\u00a0</strong>- The office manager, based on the Control Unit. They will assign tasks for processors to execute or give boosts and refreshments when the processors need them.<strong>Intan\u00a0</strong>(Intel Pentium Gold) - She's the default processor with default processing power and default cooldown rate.<strong>Ainun\u00a0</strong>(Intel Core i9) - She can do the huge tasks at slightly faster rate.\r\n\r\n<strong>Raden\u00a0</strong>(AMD Ryzen) - He does the huge tasks slower, but his heat level goes up slower.<strong>Anthony\u00a0</strong>(AMD Athlon) - He cools down faster, but does the small task slightly slower.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversifier\r\n<p><strong>Queen's Gambit: Implement mechanics that requires player to play with strategy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay requires assigning tasks at the right time to the right processor. If not, the processor may overheat and ControlU will have less processors to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offer: Implement an in-game currency</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each time a processor finishes executing a single task, the office gains <em>bits</em> as petty cash. ControlU can spend them on refreshments bought from the shop. Items available are food -- good for lowering a processor's heat level -- and coffee -- good for giving the processor a boost to do tasks faster.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Simping: Implement an item-giving mechanincs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Other than giving tasks for processors to execute, ControlU can also give food or coffee.  \r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD and arrow keys:</strong> Move<br/><strong>Space:</strong> Interact &amp; grab items<br/><strong>Esc</strong>: Close shop menu<br/><strong>Enter:</strong> Start game</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Grab a task from the table (space) and assign them to one of the processors\r\n</li><li>Wait for them to finish the task\r\n</li><li>Pay attention to the processors' heat level and prevent them from overheating\r\n</li><li>Food can bring down heat level, while coffee can give a speed boost for working on tasks.

The game will now reset after player win/lose the game, as well as when the player clicks menu button in the middle of a level.</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All sprites and character arts made by myself \r\n</p>\n<p>Local Forecast \u2013 Elevator by Kevin MacLeod | https://incompetech.com/ Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/ Creative Commons Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42bd49bc69a1744caef22d55b64c2e8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["caramel-lyth"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
