Some of these enemies include exploding pufferfish, charging dinosaurs, bouncing frogs and more. This chaotic platformer has a lot to offer as randomly generated levels help keep the game fresh and replayable and the unique twist of being able to control enemies to sabotage a player leads to a lot of fun interactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To play simply download the zip file, extract it and run the game, have fun :)</p><p>Created by:\u00a0Peter Cheshire, Paul Haynes, Kacper Nowak and Michal Majkowski</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T08:01:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e5499a0b8fae15f3a1f64875b2bd73cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Torterrad"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
