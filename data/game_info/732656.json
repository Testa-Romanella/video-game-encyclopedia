The Unreal 4.25 project is an automatic game of Tamagotchi for a module called Games Programming in the first Semester of Level 5. The game is called Open Tamagotchi.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In the future, I would like to implement a feature whereby the player could control the Tamagotchi with the keyboard or plug in a controller. The Tamagotchi will have toys and food to interact with.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I made the game on Unreal 4.25 on a Windows 10 64bit computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz\u00a0 and 16 GB of RAM. If you have similar specifications, you can run the game without any difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: You might notice the widgets\u2019 size can alter depending on the size of your computer display or monitor. I used 1920x1080.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T03:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1bf10601bf01cb814abc4bc7f7d0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Roberts Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
