Progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games. Personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game becomes difficult quickly and has a high skill bar if you want to make it past the first few rounds. Dojo is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the higher waves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4fa74408f8155b23a2529fad7effc9.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/TOY-JETS-102080608549197", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["abigfluffyyak"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["abigfluffyyak"], "esrb_rating": null}
