Uncover cards by moving them between 10 cascading stacks and 4 free cells so they fly up and complete the suit stacks. A standard deck is dealt in 10 cascading stacks. You can move the top card of a cascading stack to either an empty free cell or to the top of another cascading stack with top card same suit and one higher value. For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a stack with top card 4 of clubs. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell. Only Kings can be moved to an empty cascading stack. <br/><br/>NOTES: Not all games are winnable. You can reject a newly-dealt hand that looks unwinnable by clicking New Game again. If you click New Game before moving any cards, the game is not counted as a loss. Click Undo to undo one move at a time, or Start Over to undo all moves in the current game. <br/><br/>Seahaven Towers is a trademark of Art Cabral, used with permission.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bfa39e0933ff89cb46a3b96a111ce5f.jpg", "website": "http://fishdog.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["fishdog.net"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["fishdog.net"], "esrb_rating": null}
