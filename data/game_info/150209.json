By releasing it, I hope to start building a community of players who are interested in the game's potential (much like myself).

If you believe you may be one of these people, please sign up on our forums and consider helping us make the game the best it can be! If you find any bugs or have any ideas, just post them in the \"God Particle\" category on the forums and I'll answer you back right away.
