Touching the ground, or hitting into the school itself, will result in a game over. Clouds, trampolines and bouncy castles will propel Bobo back into the air, while the birds will knock him down. Grabbing a present will award extra points, if you manage to guide him to the end and land on a balcony (higher balconies will also award more points).</p>\n<p>Created with:</p>\n<p>C#<br/>Unity<br/></p>\n<p>Programming and design by Jack Hutchines.<br/>Art and design by Elenore Linsell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3de/3dea21b34e645b3bef97dbe851caf6b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nullific"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
