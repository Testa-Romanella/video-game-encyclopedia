That is, a video game in which the only interaction is moving around, where you have nothing to beat or achieve, and that takes place in a non-euclidean space.</p>\n<p>Spheres is another attempt at orchestrating multiple worlds together. Here, each world encapsulates the next one and is encapsulated in the previous one, like russian dolls. The only difference being that there is no biggest or smallest one : they are all nested into each other, looping infinitely.\r\nThe viewer has to find secret doors to navigate from one world to another, diving into an ever-ending zooming loop.<br/></p>\n<p>Visit\u00a0http://glkitty.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce660e6df9de9322e697580f72ff359c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["glkt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
