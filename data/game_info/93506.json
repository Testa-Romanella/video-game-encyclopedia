The story is about three very selfish people having to escape their besieged home city. During their journey they have to learn to understand the value of life in different ways.<br/><br/>The art style is inspired by some old japanese PC games, I saw screenshots of in twitter. Their names were \"Possessioner\" and \"Virgin Angel\" (googling will be NSFW-ish) I have been fascinated by pixel art for some time and decided to redraw all the art in the vn an this is the result. Putting limitations on the art style and the color palette helped me to make my art more cohesive since I have no personal style of my own.</p>\n<p><strong>---STORY---</strong><br/><br/>The royal city of Flayes has been under siege for months. The food is running out everywhere but the royal court. High society lives like there's no tomorrow, and for a reason. One night the walls protecting the city break down and Vassan, Eugenie and Memnon are forced to accept reality, their homeland is no more. High society has raised these people extremely selfish, but as they flee Flayes they are forced to change their ways. But is it possible to value kindness and life in a world where individual lives have little value?<br/><br/><strong>---CHARACTERS---</strong><br/><br/><br/>\"No, I`m not having fun. Then again, when you`re at war and everyone around you is pretending it`s New Year`s Eve, are you supposed to? I feel its my fate to be alone in party crowds, and in good company only when I`m alone with a book. Or my quill.\"<br/><br/><br/>\"It`s not about the money, it`s about being free. And that`s a lot easier when you have money. Or are a man.\"<br/><br/><br/>\"Yes, life isn`t much more than the lies we tell ourselves. The trick is pick a fun lie and tell it well.\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>--MUSIC--</strong></p>\n<p>\"Harp\" --- Jordy Hake</p>\n<p>\"Snowfall\" --- Joseph Gilbert / Kistol</p>\n<p>\"Seashore Peace Ambiance\" --- Philippe Groarke</p>\n<p>\"The Desert of Dreams\" --- TheMysticBard</p>\n<p>\"Spelunker`s Anthem\" --- TheMysticBard</p>\n<p>\"Terror/Thriller Improvisation\" --- Marcelo Fernandez</p>\n<p>\"RPG - The Graveyard\" --- HitCtrl</p>\n<p>\"Blackmoor Tides\" --- Matthew Pablo</p>\n<p><strong>--NOTE--</strong></p>\n<p>Please, note us if there's anything wrong in the game.
