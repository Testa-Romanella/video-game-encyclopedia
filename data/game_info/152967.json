At first i wanted to do a laughing game, then i found out i can not laugh for sound effect, then i did the song and still had no idea what the game will be about so i said i will make a cooking game where you mix a dish to poison your lover. Well that did not work out neither because i am a lousy cook let alone the artist to draw spaghetti, so i was stuck with tons of spoons and utensils for cooking.</p><p>Then i decided i should make a music game, uf ... but for proper music game i should do some sound analysis, and for this there was no time. so i decided that a cook and his associates should dance  to music and use the cooking tools to defend the evil bunny that i found in colouring book, i took it out, used scissors and coloured it then i took the picture of it and made used it as an icon and since i kind a like things flying against the player this is what it came out. I hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b5582f696132d08852a146ccafcb9e3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MediaAtlas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
