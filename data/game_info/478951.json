The theme was Rewind.</p>\n<p>In Unwind you play as a wind-up toy robot. Every action you perform spins down your wind-up crank. Special places in the world \u00a0allow \u00a0you to re-wind your crank and continue on your \u00a0way.</p>\n<p>The game is very incomplete as I ended up getting sick about halfway through the week and lost a couple days of development time. All in all I'm pretty satisfied with the way the game plays and I'm just very excited to make my first game jam submission!</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for stopping by!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Move - Arrow Keys, WASD or Gamepad Left Joystick</p><p>Jump - Z, Spacebar or Gamepad A</p><p>Dash - X, Left Control or Gamepad X</p><p>Pause - Escape or Gamepad Menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/017598799053886cc456159b98c28cc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Mattison"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
