It was built in 6 weeks, and is designed to be a vertical slice of a full game. It has two scenarios available(heist and Arena) and is specifically intended to be played with 4 players.<br/><br/>in the Heist, you work both against each other and with ech other to try and complete the level.\u00a0You have to work through successively difficult platforming areas while collecting as many pieces of tech as you can. Overall your goal is to collect a large meteor and escape. The player with the Meteor earns an additional 800 points.<br/><br/>In the Arena, you fight each other for points. Each kill is five points.</p>\n\n<p>The premise of the game is that you each are contractors for different large companies working to complete different kinds of jobs.\u00a0You use a mix of combat and platforming to gain the most points in a round and overcome your fellow players. Sometimes you will have to work together to solve problems.\u00a0You can choose not to, but it will make your life harder.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designers: David McCann, Thomas Kerr</p>\n<p>Programmers: Tyler Marcelis, Erick Watson</p>\n<p>Artists: Tamara Lynch, Hudson Liebelt, Christopher Sandor</p>\n\n<p>Music supplied by IlLusion, available from\u00a0</p>\n<p>www.soundcloud.com/rev-ills<br/></p>\n\n<p>\"Corporation Icons sourced from https://www.flaticon.com/ All credit goes to the original artists.\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/89328ce453a83307d92e20371e26d50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David McCann"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
