When the cage gets too damaged, it will break off the hoist cable and fall into the abyss, ending the game.</p>\n<p>The hoist moves downwards at a constant speed, but you may halve or double its speed by pushing the joystick up or down. Note that the cage will take more damage if it hits an obstacle while moving at double speed.</p>\n<p>Beware: Some of the deeper mining levels contain old and unstable dynamite, which might explode and severely damage the hoist cage!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use a joystick in port two:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpHalve the hoist speed temporarily\r\n\r\n\r\nDownDouble the hoist speed temporarily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When the game has ended, press the fire button to return to the title screen.</p>\r\nPAL/NTSC compatibility\r\n<p>The game has been developed for and tested on PAL machines.
