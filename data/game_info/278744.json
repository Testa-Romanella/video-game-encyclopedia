This unfinished game was made for the Extra Credits Holiday Game Jam, 2018. Our interpretation of the theme (\"Present\") were: the current moment in time and the presence of something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game, you play as a man with a mustache, who for some reason is stuck somewhere with invisible and glitching ghosts. The ghosts will deal damage if they get too close to him. And because of plot, the mustache man is continuously getting his health drained anyway. You can deal with the ghosts by luring them into one of the bonfires. When they burn, they drop magic orbs which will heal you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mustache man is gifted with a special ability, which lets him slow down the current moment in time for an instant. This also allows him to scan out the locations of the flickering ghosts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A bonfire can kill 3 ghosts before it extinguishes. You cannot kill the ghosts in any other way.</p>\n\n<p>Or at least that's what it was supposed to be. We scoped a little too big and came up far too short. But it was hella fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The members of the team are Premjit Salam (who designed the level and mechanics), Ningtam Wahengbam (who did all the art) and Krishnashish Gogoi (who wrote the buggy code and shader effects).</p>\n<p>We didn't get time to do any UI or even put some basic stuff in. So for anyone playing this, we apologize in advance. Use Alt + F4 to quit. Use Alt + F4 if you die anyway. There's no replay button or quit button. We're really sorry.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>Use the WASD keys and mouse for movement. Left shift to sprint, and 'E' to use your slow-time ability. Your 'E' also allows you to scan out where the enemies as well as bonfires nearby are. You cannot kill the presences directly, you have to lure them into the fires.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And uh, Alt+F4 to quit. Also, please don't jump into the river. Or off the cliffs.\u00a0We forgot to put triggers there. So yeah, really unfinished game, but if you played it, thank you for giving it your time. &lt;3</p>\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<p>The entire game.</p>\n<p>There's a health drain on the player, which we forgot to turn off when the game just starts. So if you're reading instructions at the start, your HP continues to drain. It's a one-line fix but we thought it's too minor to bother the jam organizers to send a late update to the game.</p>\n<p>There's no triggers to handle you falling into the river or off the cliff. Use Alt + F4 if you fell off or get stuck.</p>\n<p>No Quit button or replay button. Alt + F4. Should really just rename game to Alt + F4 at this point.</p>\n\n\r\nSound credits:\r\n<p>anomalous_underdog -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/anomalous_underdog/sounds/123437/</p>\n<p>ztitchez - https://freesound.org/people/ztitchez/sounds/370754/</p>\n<p>dekker462 - https://freesound.org/people/dekker462/sounds/436510/</p>\n<p>hpnguyen52 - https://freesound.org/people/hpnguyen52/sounds/166258/</p>\n\r\nOther credits:\r\n<p>Low poly water asset by Ebru Dogan -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/lowpoly-water-1075...</p>\n<p>'Sky_3' skybox material from ColorSkies by NightSoundGames -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/colorskies-91541</p>\n<p>I got the glitch effect on the Hologram shader, from a Hologram Shader here -\u00a0https://github.com/andydbc/HologramShader</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c39c8a1bf3134d9678fd84261b5619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krishnashish Gogoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
