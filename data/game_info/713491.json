{"id": 713491, "slug": "ifyood", "name": "iFyood", "name_original": "iFyood", "description": "<p>iFyood is the next generation of visual novel video games. You play the role of an average teenage\u00a0 girl making her way through life. She has a best friend, a crush, and a lot of choices to make on the way. The game involves choices in romance, friendship, and even career. So far it's a very well made Visual Novel, and should be on everyone's radar. This game has a lot of potential to shine, with good voice acting and soundtracks. The story is unique, and the characters are interesting enough to be remembered. The art style is one of a kind, and it fits the story perfectly. If you like Visual Novels and are looking for something different, this is definitely something you should try. I recommend this game to any VN lover who can't get enough of them.</p><p>ALSO AVAILABLE IN FULL VERSION , YOUMAY REQUEST A KEY IN COMMENTS OF FULL VERSION AND POSSIBLY MAYGETS ONE IF THE TRICKLER DECIDES</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c2/4c28457a35a3655c4b0c35048b13c5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Q-BONE SUPER DEV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
