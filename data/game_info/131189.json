Unfortunately, the game has quite a bit of extra assets attached to the texture sheets which pads the game's overall file size. I can't be bothered to make it more lean.\u00a0<br/><br/>Anyway, check it out with your XBox Controller! Hold R to restart.</p><p>The main reason development has ceased is because the art assets make the file sizes much too large, \u00a0and development was getting tedious and buggy (bad compiles) I've since moved on to smaller games using Game Maker Studio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/301/301b6179b7a0745be6d1d4e92d56f1ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["@ColtonPhillips"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
