As in all dice games, players must roll the dice, but this game has its own identity. Players know the number that they need to roll using 2 dice to advance on the board. Players could win by being first to get to space number 6 or by others being eliminated.  On each space (1-6) there are 6 possible combinations that a player could roll to advance and 5 that could set them back.  Many other combinations will leave the player standing still.   In this case, a player may have an opportunity to be safe and wait for their next turn or chance and risk a setback. It\u2019s all in the roll!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9ab04ad36a30a0956de5cc806a7a5572.jpg", "website": "http://www.domesticactivities.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Domestic Activities"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Domestic Activities"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
