It can also be used to provide heat, or used as a method of keeping time.</p><p>A candle manufacturer is traditionally known as a chandler. Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop candle holders to elaborate chandeliers.</p><p>For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and vaporizes a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant flame. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via capillary action; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.</p>For the people who asked in their head \"It's an Horror Game?\", the answer is \"Yes\".<p> This game will be divided in four parts, and the next parts will be here very, very, very soon, so don't be sad for waiting the same time above PIX-T and I.U.S.H. becose we're making very fast the 2, 3, and 4.</p><p> I don't want to make the walktrough of this game because I wand to keep this game in the title of \"Surprise\", so you have to play it to view what it looks like.
