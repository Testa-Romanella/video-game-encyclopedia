It's \"complete\" as far as you can reach an end but is still missing features I had planned to add as well as polish beyond that.\u00a0</p>\r\nBugs\r\n<p>I'm sure there are bugs in the game but I tried to clean up anything I found that was game-breaking. If you do find any specific bugs definitely let me know and I'll do my best to fix them for the future.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhy?\r\n<p>I haven't worked on this project for a while so I figured it made sense to make it available. There is always the possibility more will be added but I'd like to look at that in the future with a fresh perspective on the games story and themes.\u00a0Hopefully anyone who plays it can find some fun in it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T13:29:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/789/789b94e3714475e7cd7c9e77aae7d496.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Syviery"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
