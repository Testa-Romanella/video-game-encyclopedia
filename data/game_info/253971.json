Instead, Squally teaches hacking through fun engaging puzzles where learning is a by-product.<br/><br/>This is <strong>not</strong> crappy education software masquerading as a game. Entertainment and education are equally important, and this game won't disappoint.<br/><br/>A 12 year old should be able to complete the main storyline in this game. For the more hardcore players, there will be more challenging side content. Topics such as data types, data structures, bin/dec/hex, and x86 assembly are gradually introduced through puzzles and gameplay.<br/><br/>In other words: this game teaches you the hardest parts of computer science in the coolest way possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-29T10:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e6442c7481857f32163f498adf909eb3.jpg", "website": "https://squallygame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zcanann", "Zachary Canann", "Matt Bucci"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Squalr"], "esrb_rating": null}
