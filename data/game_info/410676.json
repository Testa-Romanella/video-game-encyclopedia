But what do you find when you get there? Damage, holes, leaks oh but wait it is also the season the dreaded and mortal enemy's of the beavers, THE MOOSE, are migrating near the area at this time and are surely to attack!<br/></p>\n<p>Do you have what it takes to fix the dam and withstand the nightly onslaught of the dreaded Moose? It is only a week. It can't be that hard right? A simple forage for resources in the daytime while your base gets attacked at night but with a twist...\u00a0</p>\n<p>You do 2 rolls at the start of each day. One will determine which paths are available to you in the local forest where there may be an abundance of resources. The other is the strength and formation of the Moose attacks. Which will attack on the 7th Day! Oh and also, weather is random and affects both the outcomes of which resources are available! Have fun!!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Please note that the night cycle is not implemented\u00a0as yet. This will be done over the next couple of weeks. If you find any bugs please list them below.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3ca32e41df3037dd09f9da7cca4b76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DesignSting"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
