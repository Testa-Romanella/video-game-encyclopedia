The cosmos themselves are raining down. Defend it with everything you've got.\"</em>\n\n<p>Defend your planet from incoming space debris. Blast asteroids, avoid collisions, use power-ups - and get a high score! This game plays like a twin-stick-shooter with a <em>twist. </em>All movement is \"orbital.\" Your ship moves in an orbit around your planet, as do the enemies. It's a pretty neat spin on the classic space-shooter genre.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><em>Although Centroid is compatible with a mouse &amp; keyboard, we believe the PS4 Dualshock or Xbox One controllers to be superior input methods for this game.<br/></em></p>\r\nPS4 Dualshock (Preferred)  \r\n<p>Left stick to move<br/>Right stick to shoot<br/>\u25a1 to execute powerup<br/>\u2a2f to submit/select<br/></p>\r\nMouse &amp; Keyboard\r\n<p>WASD to move<br/>Mouse to aim<br/>Left Click to shoot<br/>Space to execute powerup<br/>Left Click to submit/select<br/></p>\r\nXbox One Controller (In-Development)\r\n<p>Left stick to move<br/>Right stick to shoot<br/>(A) to execute powerup<br/>(A) to submit/select</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game Design / UI Design / Programming - Walker Perkins<br/>3D Art / Animation / Game Design - Al Howell<br/>Programming / Testing - Bob Hibbs<br/>Music by Bensound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47ee96af7f4c9a073dc14db1b98e08c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bravado Game Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
