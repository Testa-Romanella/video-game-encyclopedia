Hassled by an annoying adventuring archaeologist, you set out for revenge! But beware - though your curses are powerful, you are also cursed with the curse of the Cursed Mummy! </p><p>But grab a friend because YOU are also the archaeologist and a bunch of supporting characters! This idiotic adventure is for two players so long as you are capable of sharing a computer chair and following rudimentary directions!</p><p><strong>The Curse of the Cursed Mummy </strong>is a short visual novel/choose your own adventure from Two-Fisted Fantasy. Extremely stupid. Plays best with two players (hotseat) but you can play it alone if you're hard up for friends. A playthough will probably only take a few minutes but it might take a little while to get to all the endings. I'll probably get round to making a nicer version of this at some point.</p><p>Made in 24 hours to support a Let's Play of a (currently) non-existent game, \"The Wizard of Warlock Tower\". Games from the Two-Fisted Fantasy series that currently exist: Star Bastards (check it out if you're interested). More of this sort of thing will be coming out sooner or later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a332ffbc40e115bfe4905bdbc0c4569c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hermit Skull"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
