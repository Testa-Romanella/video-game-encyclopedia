In oxBin figures is not just a set of pixels, but real physical bodies with its velocity and momentum. Objects don't just fall down, you can grab and move them by fingers. Don't like the way figures lay - shake the phone, and build a small earthquake on the field. Can you be a champion and set a record that nobody in the world will be able to beat? You'll never know if you don't try.<br/><br/>It's an\u200b addictive computer game. A small Canadian study has found that playing with tetrominoes\u200b may be a more effective way to treat lazy eye than existing practices, as it trains both eyes to work together.<br/><br/>By embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos, the oxBin game provides an intellectual sport that combines continuous fun with mental stimulation.
