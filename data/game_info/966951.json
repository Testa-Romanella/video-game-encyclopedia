Or team up with up to five friends as the World Leaders, Industry, Media, Scientists and Public, and try to survive. Impossible dilemmas and branching narratives create countless paths in this strategic party game!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As Planet Earth, your goal is to destroy humanity to ensure your own survival. You can trigger disasters and all kinds of events to damage the Ecosystems &amp; Pollution and turn the planet into an unliveable hell! Earth\u2019s arsenal is based on real-life threats, ranging from virus outbreaks, to solar flares, and even asteroid impacts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As the World Leaders, you create the laws and regulations the others need to abide by. If a virus breaks out, will you instigate global lockdowns, partial lockdowns, or none at all? Will you forcefully evacuate the Public ahead of the asteroid impact and risk revolt to save their lives, or will you value their free will? <br/><br/>The Industry manages all corporations and the economy. Will you force your staff to work remotely to limit virus spread, force them to come into the office to limit productivity loss, or allow them to choose for themselves? Will you hire the Scientists to research ways to lower your emissions, or prioritize profits?<br/><br/>Scientists need to spend resources to successfully complete scientific research and discover solutions to humanity's struggles. The more you spend, the bigger the chance of success, but at the cost of lowering your influence. Will you prioritize the greater good? Or will self-interest prevail?<br/><br/>The Media needs to report the news and inform the other players. Will you do your duty and keep it truthful, or will you sensationalize events for more clicks? Will your praise the Industry's decision to force employees to work from home, criticize them for harming the little guy, or ignore it altogether and focus on something more click-worthy?<br/><br/>The last role is the Public, representing the everyday citizen. Will you follow virus safety guidelines or do you want to keep living life as usual? Will you enter the asteroid impact zone to save your fellow humans, or leave it up to rescue workers? And what does it take before you rise up in full revolt?<br/><br/><br/>With a wide variety of branching narratives, each decision you make leads humanity down a different path. So carefully consider the consequences of your actions. Will you prioritize the greater good? Or will self-interest prevail?<br/><br/><br/>Be sure to join the Project Planet Discord server to keep up with the latest updates, and find people to play with!<h3>Key features:</h3><br/>- 1 vs 5 party gameplay<br/>- Destroy Humanity as Planet Earth<br/>- Survive a wide range of disasters as Humanity<br/>- Play as one of 5 Humanity roles, each with unique gameplay<br/>- Answer impossible dilemmas with real-life parallels<br/>- Work together, but also pursue your own interests.
