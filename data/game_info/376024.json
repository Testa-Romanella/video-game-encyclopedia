If you send me enough, I will list you as a tester.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/><br/>Brad, a jock, trips one day (at a party, we can only assume), accidentally plunging himself into the hallucinatory world of\u00a0<strong>The Cerebral Symphony</strong>\u00a0where he meets a guy called\u00a0<strong>Ivan</strong>, who you might wonder is a human metaphor for repressed teenage angst.</p>\n<p>Join the schizophrenic, multiple-personality-disorder afflicted Ivan, whose destiny (and personalities) you can steer through his individual choices as he bumbles his way through his life as a renegade thief into a big war between the underground cyborg\u00a0<strong>Mafia</strong>, the omnipresent, all-seeing\u00a0<strong>Corporation</strong>\u00a0and the corrupt, power-crazed\u00a0<strong>Government</strong>\u00a0over the six elemental stones that, when gathered together, bestow\u00a0<strong>ULTIMATE POWER</strong>\u00a0on their holder. Mwahahaha!</p>\n<p>On the way you will meet\u00a0<strong>Liz</strong>\u00a0the ADHD werewolf,\u00a0<strong>Jean</strong>\u00a0the insomniac minstrel,\u00a0<strong>Catherine</strong>\u00a0the telepath with a firey temper,\u00a0<strong>Carys</strong>\u00a0the delusional young stage actress,\u00a0<strong>Robert</strong>\u00a0the narcoleptic doctor,\u00a0<strong>Zak</strong>\u00a0the homeostatically-imbalanced fighter-pilot, and\u00a0<strong>Bain</strong>\u00a0the accident prone Gladiator. You will decide whether in the final estimation it is Ivan's more \"upbeat\" or his \"darker\" pesonality that will win control of his mind as they battle with his more balanced, \"pensive\" side.</p>\n<p>Story-driven and choice-based, The Cerebral Symphony is a distopian 2d RPG game with an emphasis on character development and fun, non-random, side-view, Final Fantasy VI style battles, made up of 5 chapters.</p>\n<p>Featuring the Fully Completed\u00a0<strong>MULTIPLE PERSONALITY SYSTEM</strong>(TM), where Ivan's in-game choices will affect dialogue and plot, alter the screen tint and interface colours and change his battle class and music. You only gain skills in the personality in which you fight! Your choices will affect the story!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T07:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8343bfaccddd3c031bdc1463b99673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Faenon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
