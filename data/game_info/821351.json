Unfortunately, due to a family emergency I was unable to complete the game to the standard I would have liked. However, since I had at least completed the main gameplay loop I decided to upload anyway and hopefully someone might find some fun in what I have created.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to eliminate all other players and be the last player standing. Every player has an attack bumper on the front, coloured red, and defence bumpers at the back and sides, coloured blue. If your attack bumper hits another players defence bumper they will take damage equal to the value of both players dice. This will disable the other car for a few seconds, turn all their bumpers red and reroll their dice.\u00a0 The number above the dice is your hit points, when this is reduced to zero you are eliminated. Having a high roll will mean you do more damage, but you can potentially take more damage too, so be careful! Falling out of the arena will not cause any harm and will just return you after falling for a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Colliding your attack bumper with another players attack bumper is supposed to just knock both players back. However, at high speeds one or both players might take damage instead. This is not intended.</li><li>Falling through the map at the start *shrugs*</li><li>Sometimes players just get stuck on the ground</li><li>AI have a tendency to fling themselves out of the arena. Don't worry, this does not harm the AI.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Extra features:</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to implement everything I wanted within the timeframe. If I had more time this is what I'd add:</p>\n<ul><li>Sound!</li><li>More cars to choose from</li><li>More arenas with obstacles</li><li>Player abilities: A boost ability, a shield, and the ability to re-roll your dice</li><li>Pickups: When eliminating a player they would drop a health pack to replenish health</li><li>A main menu</li><li>Polish....LOTS of polish!</li></ul>\n<p>Thank You!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:57:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c1bab5e9eb2a5f40c2d9ae6eb057538.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NineOhGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
