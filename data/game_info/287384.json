The controls are simple and can be learned within seconds, but mastering the intricacies of flight will require much more practice.<br/>\r\nAccompanied by a neon-lit, geometric art style and a lush, musical soundscape, Top Torch is centered around superbly satisfying physics-based combat mechanics which contain tactical depth within their mechanical simplicity.
