Again, the mechanism is simple. The ground is inscribed with a poem describing the meaning of \u201cNetzach\u201d; the player must read and interpret this inscription. Furthermore, mechanical angels stalk the player and build the City of Netzach (the city of machines) around the player while the player leaps through the space. There\u2019s no specific goal. The player can explore the warrens of the machine city. The player could try to orchestrate the machines into some kind of configuration. Or, the player can try to climb the machine city (often a worthy pursuit, and goal). All of these different pathways further reveal the meaning of this machine world. At the five minute mark, the title screen will rise, and the player will be overwhelmed by the angels (and their sounds).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bdb5667c40d2d26a7306112c431d0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saitogroup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
