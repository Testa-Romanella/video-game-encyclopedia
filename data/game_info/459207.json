To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. The game is controlled via a point and click interface, and features a HUD navigated primarily through &quot;windows&quot; modeled on Windows 95.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-27T21:03:48", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Blue Byte"], "esrb_rating": null}
