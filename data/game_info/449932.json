The original goal was experimenting with sidescrolling, shooting and movement feel \u2014 screen shakes, dashes and all that fun stuff (and a few special tricks for good measures, but no spoilers). It's the first of three sequences I have planned for the full version.</p>\n<p>Not sure when that's gonna happen: since the game is from when I was a complete novice at coding, it's got so much spaghetti it could successfully apply for Italian citizenship. I realized it would take a while to turn it into something decent first and then add content later, so I'm gonna let it sit until I feel up to the task. Thanks, past me.<br/></p>\n<p>Right now I'm gonna focus on Salagander (short term) and Demi Dash (long term), then I might go back to this one. Any feedback is welcome! If you play it and have thoughts about it leave a comment!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fceb1724a5bd02934ff1597c8db4d0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrMandolino"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
