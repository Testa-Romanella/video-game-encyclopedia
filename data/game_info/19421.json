Combined with our original bluesy soundtrack, you will soon find yourself immersed in Full Bore's mines, temples, scrapyards, lava tubes, inexplicable lakes and/or mysterious laboratories.<br/><br/>With over 150 areas, no single intended path and secrets everywhere, Full Bore gives you a world in which you can always find something new (until you find everything)New on SteamFull Bore is digging its way to Steam for the first time in May, featuring both Part 1: The First Dig, and the never-before-played Part 2: Into Hard Earth.
