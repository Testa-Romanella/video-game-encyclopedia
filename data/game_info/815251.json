They were then tasked with creating their own level or  sub-game featuring these.</p>\n<p>Game Jam hosted and originally published by Owen Ryan.</p>\n<p>My part was 'The Rhythm Part', a bullet hell rhythm game where you have to dodge things and shoot things with the beat.</p>\n<p>While there's an overall tutorial for all the available mechanics (not all necessarily used!), my part doesn't have much of a tutorial due to time constraints!</p><p>So here's a quick rundown for The Rhythm Part:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Anything pink will hurt. Anything with a heart can be shot. You can only shoot on the (heart)beat.</li><li>You can also dodge through things, and cancel the dodge early by pressing any other movement direction. The dodge can be a bit janky and takes some getting used to.</li><li>My level is quite hard, you might die a lot! There's a secret health booster if you walk to the arrow ammo UI in the top left and press the interact button (E on keyboard).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T04:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61ca17523918110077dac61f6147acaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philip Waldron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
