You probably know the rest by heart.</p>\n<p>There is however a minor difference. Because the current global population</p>\n<p>has exceeded eight billion individuals, there is no longer enough time for</p>\n<p>personal house calls. Instead Santa lands on your roof top, crams your</p>\n<p>presents down your chimney and is off to the next house. A delivery system</p>\n<p>not unlike Amazon's.</p>\n<p>In this game you experience what it is like to work in this fashion. You</p>\n<p>are Old Saint Nick and some off-screen elf is throwing presents down</p>\n<p>towards you while saying for whom they are intended, using initials for</p>\n<p>privacy reasons of course. Jab each present with the right amount of force</p>\n<p>to make it go down the correct chimney.</p>\n<p>Out of excitement over every successful delivery you become somewhat</p>\n<p>elevated, making it harder to deliver the next present. If you make a</p>\n<p>mistake, the game is over. But when you have successfully delivered 16</p>\n<p>presents, you win!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Press 1-4 to jab, where the number indicates the amount of force with</p>\n<p>which this is done.</p>\n<p>--- Code Explanation ---</p>\n<p>Line 0: Read the following text strings from elsewhere in the code:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Santa's hand and candy cane</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Victory text</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Present being pushed</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Game Over text</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Santa himself</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a loop, construct Santa's arm and vertical orientation string.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set background to black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set Santa's initial height.</p>\n<p>Line 1: Clear the screen and display the rows of chimneys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the present's initial horizontal co-ordinate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set a variable with the screen position to the right of the</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 extended candy cane.</p>\n<p>Line 2: Randomly create an ASCII value from 'A' to 'D'.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Display for whom the current present is intended and Santa.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set Santa's initial arm length.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Set the present's initial vertical co-ordinate.</p>\n<p>Line 3: Display Santa's arm and candy cane and the falling present.</p>\n<p>Line 4: If Santa's arm is extended and there is a present at the end, then</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 display, in a loop, the present being pushed to the position with</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the specified horizontal co-ordinate.</p>\n<p>Line 5: Read the keyboard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Retract Santa's arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Determine the numeric value of the key pressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If this value is between 1 and 4, then extend Santa's arm and</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 specify the horizontal co-ordinate.</p>\n<p>Line 6: Set the vertical co-ordinate of the falling present 1 position</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As long as the present hasn't reached the bottom, jump to line 3.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains data for text strings.</p>\n<p>Line 7: If the present's horizontal co-ordinate matches the one of the</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 correct chimney, then set Santa's vertical co-ordinate 1 position</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 higher.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As long as Santa hasn't reached the top, jump to line 1.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains data for text strings.</p>\n<p>Line 8: Clear the screen and display how many presents were successfully</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 delivered and the game over text.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If Santa had reached the top, then also display the victory text.</p>\n<p>Line 9: Wait for a key to be pressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Restart the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This line also contains data for a text string.</p>\n<p>---</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T12:46:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c22527e79d3229c8f163dad5724ee74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
