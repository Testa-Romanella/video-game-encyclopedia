The project was first and foremost a learning experience for the team. Some of the team members were new to game development and have made it a long way since starting! I also learned a lot leading my own team for the first time!</p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Players complete levels by both standing on the yellow squares at the same time</p>\n<p>There are two types of pressure plates, sticky (green) and timed\u00a0(blue). If a player walks over a pressure plate, a door somewhere on the map will open. Sometimes multiple pressure plates must be activated at the same time to open a door.</p>\n<p>Boxes can be pushed by the player. These boxes can activate pressure plates also.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Player 1 - WASD</p>\n<p>Player 2 - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Esc to access pause menu</p>\r\nTeam Members:\r\n<ul><li>Aaron Buckles (team lead/programmer)</li><li>Kierstin Roque (programmer)</li><li>James Tran (programmer)</li><li>Camden Kuwahara (programmer)</li><li>Brian Jiang (programmer)</li></ul>\n\n<strong><em>Enjoy!!!</em></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b7016f6e9b12f6a4ee80f6cd140096f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["buck1e5"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
