It is a time of mystery, change and struggle.  It is a time of opportunity.   </p>\n<p> In this asymmetric, two-player piece of interactive fiction, you and  your partner each take on the role of a leader of a great nation on the  last night of a war.  A war one side did not even know it was fighting.   Will you play as the general of the King\u2019s army, riding north to retake  the lands that rebelled against the royal line hundreds of years ago?   Or will you play the Dictator of the Republic, who finds herself  abandoned in a city wholly unprepared for war, now apparently only able  to decide what her last few hours will look like in the city that she  loves?   </p>\n<p> Both have little doubt that the city of Alexisgrad will fall tonight.  The question that both must ask is how it will fall.   </p>\n<p> Both you and your gaming partner will need a copy of \u2018The Last Night of Alexisgrad\u2019 in order to play. <br/></p>\n<p>Single Player now supported (Beta).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b9/2b9fb6d205fc25c7bbee094ea5e56e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Akinis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
