The games cover a wide variety of styles, genres, and themes as they fight against any definition of \"indie game\" as a genre.</p>\n<p>Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each contributor is paid\u00a0and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.</p>\r\nThis Month's Games\r\n<br/>Mushrooms &amp; Magic 1e (Indiepocalypse Edition) (Physical) by\u00a0Featherboy Press\r\n\n<p>After apocalypse, Mushroomkind awoke, surrounded by strange beasts &amp; remnant technology from humans long passed. But Mushrooms are small, and the world is large &amp; unexplored - will you answer the call?</p>\n<p>Mushrooms &amp; Magic runs using a modified Powered by the Apocalypse / Monster of the Week-like system, with mechanics for tool crafting, abilities, and several magic types. The game only requires one die - a d20 - and makes use of just four basic stats. While not rules-light per se, plenty of room is left within the game's structure for players to modify core aspects (and add their own!) as wanted within campaigns, and GM's are encouraged to have fun with the setting above all else. This Indiepocalypse Edition includes an exclusive Clade of Mushrooms to play as &amp; additional NPC art found nowhere else!</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nGOD KISS (Physical) by\u00a0Stuart Holmes\r\n\n<p>A rules-lite power fantasy ttrpg where Players are overpowered demons that must kill gods~!</p>\n\r\nSwordfighting for People Who Are Really Bad at Swordfighting (WIN/MAC/Linux) by\u00a0Cahatstrophe Games\r\n\n<p>Are you good at swordfighting? Or maybe you're just okay at swordfighting? Perhaps you've just had one lesson once, years ago? If that sounds like you, this game is explicitly not for you. But if you're not just bad at swordfighting, but really bad at swordfighting, this game might be exactly what you need!</p>\n<p>This is a physics based 2d swordfighting game for people who spent more time doodling in math class than paying attention. It features many levels, two kinds of sword, and only a teensy tiny small little chance of achieving sentience and trying to murder you!</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nCards of the Bog (WIN/MAC/Linux) by\u00a0Abhi Sundu\r\n\n\n<p>A short, strategic deckbuilder with just a sprinkle of horror.
