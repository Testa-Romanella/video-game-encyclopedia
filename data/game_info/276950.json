In our first release of Pigeon Shoo, you must shoo the pigeons away by touching them.  It is easy at first with just 5 pigeons, but as the game progresses, the pigeons get smaller and faster until it is nearly impossible to shoo them all!  The backgrounds are photos we took from Southwestern PA, and there are no ads in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cd4e8086f9761c300d14b0501a398a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Little Family Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Little Family Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
