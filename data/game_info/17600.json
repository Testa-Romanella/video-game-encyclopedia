{"id": 17600, "slug": "sniper-ghost-warrior-2-2", "name": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2", "name_original": "Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2", "description": "<p>A sequel to Sniper: Ghost Warrior is based on CryEngine 3 and is somewhat similar to such tactical shooters as Crysis.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The protagonist is Cole Anderson, a gruff American ex-Marine, who accompanies a CIA agent on a mission. Their goal is to capture a group of mercenaries who are trying to obtain a biological weapon of mass destruction. The villain, former Russian spy Merinov, is going to sell the weapon to a terrorist organization that plans to provoke a nuclear war. The protagonist will perform a number of stealth military operations in Philippines\u2019 jungle and in the highland of Tibet. There are also playable flashbacks about Anderson\u2019s experiences during the Bosnian conflict that provide more details about his past with Merinov.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Just like its name suggests, the game puts a strong emphasis on sniping. There are many mechanics that aim to make the marksmanship realistic. Each bullet\u2019s trajectory strongly depends on the wind and distance to the target. There\u2019s a HUD that displays the intensity and direction of the wind, allowing the player to aim better. A red dot indicates where the bullet will hit, though this can be disabled in a higher difficulty level. The character\u2019s physical state also influences his accuracy, and after running, he has to rest for a while before shooting. Stealth is also a vital component of the gameplay. Anderson has to sneak past enemy soldiers and cannot survive an open encounter against multiple opponents.</p>", "metacritic": 52, "released": "2013-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50e2785bd341c8c3a01b4fdac011b2e0.jpg", "website": "http://sniperghostwarrior2.com", "rating": 3.13, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 93, "owned": 1918, "beaten": 166, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 79, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 123, "ratings_count": 225, "suggestions_count": 656, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 226, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["City Interactive", "4EversGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["CI Games", "City Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
