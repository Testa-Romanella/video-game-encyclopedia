Almost everything is coded from ground up in C/C++ for reasons mostly educational. <br/></p>\n<p>The only code not written by me are are renderer APIs, OS APIs, a couple of stb and standard\u00a0library headers.\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p>The idea for this game comes from my  freshmen student project back in university. I felt that the idea is simple enough to be a proof of concept for an engine I'm writing from scratch. <br/></p>\n<p>Alas I must move on to other projects, but if for some reason this gets popular enough, I will consider adding more features as well as porting it to other platforms. We'll see!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, art and sound by me, momodevelop.</p>\n<p>TTF and image loading code from stb.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks for the Handmade Hero movement for motivating and inspiring me to start all this. It was a wonderful mind expanding experience. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/89241578570739a7bf96a48bc1f7377d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\ud83c\udf51 momodevelop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
