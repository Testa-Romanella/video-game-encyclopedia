When you see the results of your actions, it has already happened.</p>\n<p>Pick up care packages for an advantage on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Beware, you have limited fuel so be quick about dispatching the competition.</p>\n\r\nHow to play.\r\n<p>In the beginning of each turn. Each player is given a number of action points, shown as yellow stars over their tank.\r\n<br/>\r\nAll players input their commands at the same time. When the last action point is used or the countdown reaches zero (default 5 seconds) the game enters playback mode and the consequences of all the actions are shown. Then a new turn starts.\r\n<br/>\r\nThis continues until there is only one tank left on the battlefield or the max number of turns has been played (default 10 turns).</p>\n<p><strong>Remember! It costs an action to turn the tank to a new direction. So if you are facing \"east\" and want to move one square to the north it takes two presses of up on the d-pad.</strong></p>\n\r\nControls.\r\n<br/>\n\r\nPick up legend.\r\nGain 1 action point for next turnInstantly remove the last move of all opponents, lasts one turnInstantly reversing the inputs of all opponents, lasts one turnShield, can take one hitRailgun, shoots thru any number of breakable objectsSuperbomb, creates a big blast in all directions.
