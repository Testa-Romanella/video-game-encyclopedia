(* indicates our own original game creations)<br/><br/>CLEAN INTERFACE <br/>Solebon has a clean, professional look. You won't find photographic backgrounds, wild card designs, or sparkly effects. The interface has what you need to play comfortably with no distractions.<br/><br/>REAL CARD PLAY <br/>Solebon is modeled on how you'd play with an actual card deck. Click to drag cards around or deal them from the stock. If card dragging is difficult for you, you can click to highlight a card then click where you want it to move. Either method will smoothly move the cards. In games where there is only one possible place to move a card, a single click does the job for faster play. Also, the Auto feature speeds up otherwise tedious play by moving cards into foundations for you. <br/><br/>NO HINTS OR CHEATS <br/>Solebon randomly shuffles the cards before each game; it does not stack the deck for you or against you. Just like real cards, you're playing against the shuffle. Harder games are difficult to win because the rules are against you - even with perfect play! This is the true nature of solitaire. And Solebon will not help. <br/><br/>QUICK FEATURE LIST <br/>\u2022 Large, easy-to-read cards <br/>\u2022 Drag cards or click cards to move <br/>\u2022 Rules sidebar <br/>\u2022 Stats sidebar <br/>\u2022 Unlimited undo <br/>\u2022 Foundation autoplay <br/>\u2022 Timer <br/>\u2022 Scoring <br/>\u2022 Moves tracking", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T15:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/08872f1391c30368f84565b7ded3ba69.jpg", "website": "http://solebon.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Solebon"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Solebon"], "esrb_rating": null}
