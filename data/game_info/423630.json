The game is based on the good old Blitz game that\u00a0some of you might remember from the VIC20.</em><br/><br/><strong>The Story:</strong><br/>Captain Cloudberry is back, and this time he has to fight evil Zombies populating an abandoned city far into the desert. \u00a0But as Captain Cloudberry\u00a0approach the city,\u00a0 he\u00a0discover that he has almost no gas left and his plane slowly drops to the ground.\u00a0 The airport is too far away, so his only choice is to land in the city.\u00a0\u00a0To do so Captain Cloudberry has to\u00a0bomb\u00a0\u00a0away all Zombie infested sky scrapers, and make a safe place to land his plane.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>You control a plane that moves across the screen. When the plane reaches the end of the screen, it drops one line down and turns around.\u00a0\u00a0Below is a city with skyscrapers, and when the plane comes to close to the buildings, it will crash and game is over. To avoid collision,\u00a0\u00a0you have to drop bombs from the plane, and hit the buildings to clear the landing. The bombs are dropped by pressing fire on your joystick, and when you release the button a bomb is released from the plane.\u00a0It is not possible to drop more than one bomb at the same time.\u00a0The level is completed when all obstacles are removed, and the plane can safely land on the\u00a0bottom of the screen.<br/><br/><strong>Difficulties:</strong><br/>If you find the game to easy/hard you can change the level of difficulty on the main menu. Pressing \"F1\" will set difficulty from level 1 to 5, where \"L1\" is easiest with very short buildings. You can also set speed on the plane by pressing \"F5\".\u00a0 Default is set to\" L3\" and \"Slow Speed\" , a setting most of the players can master.\u00a0<br/><br/>If you find this game impossible hard no matter how easy you put the settings, there is a built in trainer that you can activate on the main menu by pressing \"F8\"<br/><br/><strong>Technical info:</strong><br/>The game size is only 4 kilobytes, and is a little warm up for<em>\u00a0</em><em>the Reset 64 Craptastic 4k games coding competition</em>. We hope this little game can inspire many C64 game developers to attend in this years compo.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Buy the physical version:</strong><br/>The game is also available on Cartridge as a physical release from<strong>\u00a0</strong>BOBR Games<strong>\u00a0. It is also available in the Protovision shop.</strong> The game is a part of the <strong>\"</strong><em>Single Button Games Collection</em><strong>\"</strong> together with 9 other amazing single button games.<br/><br/><strong>What is different from the physical version:</strong><br/>The physical version was made in 2019, and the digital version was upgraded in 2020.\u00a0 <em>Docster</em> has optimized the code even more to make the game smaller.\u00a0\u00a0<em>Magnar</em> has made a new small upgraded\u00a0music player allowing us to have more modern instruments but still have a song that is no more than\u00a05-600 bytes. <em>Rotteroy</em> drew a loading picture and <em>Magnar</em> wrote a brand new song for the loader. <em>Rotteroy</em> wrote an instructionspage with elements from the game as Petscii graphics.\u00a0\u00a0And finally Docster onefiled and NTSC fixed everything so both Pal/NTSC users can play this little game.<strong><br/><br/>Credits:</strong><br/>Programming by <em>Docster</em><br/>All graphics by <em>Rotteroy</em><br/>Ingame Music by <em>Rotteroy</em> &amp; <em>Magnar</em><br/>Loading music by <em>Magnar</em><br/><br/>Instructions with Petscii graphics written by <em>Rotteroy</em><br/>Instructions page programmed by <em>Scroll</em><br/><br/>Developed by <em>Megastyle</em> in 2019/2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73a/73a761c32e446313e414d5e9d225fd08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
