The only catch? When you touch bugs they send you back 2 seconds in time. This can be helpful, but in most cases not. As you go through 5 levels, trying to repair your broken computer clock (while being bribed with cheese,) you're introduced with new challenges which make you think and mad enough almost to the point of rage quitting.</p>\n<p>Good luck, time is not on your side.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. If you get all the way through, you may have a surprise waiting for you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:08:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/95672a7852d346216f3c0b52ac6f834f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["yaakgold", "strailks"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
