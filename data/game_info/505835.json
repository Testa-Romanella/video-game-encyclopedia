Talking cats was seen as the superior option.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Is it true that cats simplified the political process?</strong><br/><br/>A: Yes! The Fancy Furballs have a maximum of six Presidential candidates, instead of letting everyone and their grandma run for election. (Sorry, grandma.) And instead of having over 50 separate elections, there are just two: the East Coast Primary and the West Coast Primary!<br/><br/><strong>Q: What gorgeous cats can the main character fall in love with?</strong><br/><br/>A: There are six main storylines in this game, one for each candidate.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>By far the most qualified candidate is <strong>Poopsie IX</strong>. Groomed for success from an early age, he's hair apparent of Poopsie I, the first ever cat president. But though he knows everything about politics, he has a lot to learn about love. Will you teach him how to think with his heart and not his head?<br/><br/><strong>Kaleidoscope </strong> is a handsome movie star, hoping to dip his tail into the world of politics. Unfortunately he's treating his campaign like a promotional tour\u2014and his agent seems determined to derail everything! Can this Clawlywood cat claw his way to the top?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Wildcard candidate <strong>Mr. Biscuits</strong> loves hanging out with his kitten and telling hilarious dad jokes. No kitten around! But can a working single dad handle the stress of a Presidential campaign? Or will his candidacy be scratched?<br/><br/><strong>Fe.Line</strong> is a robot cat, specially programmed to become President of the United States. Though he may seem cold and emotionless at first, he does have some softer subroutines in his robotic heart. Can you crack the code of this mechanical candidate?<br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong>Earl Grey</strong> is old. Like, super old. But even though he's lost many (MANY) Presidential elections in the past, he's hoping that his two decades of experience will be enough for him to triumph\u2014or at least, get those dang kittens to turn their music down.<br/><br/>And finally! <strong>Banders </strong> is a wildcat who's spent most of his life as a political protester. Now he's trying to dismantle the system from within! ...Just as soon as he finds his pudding cups.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab8d22427b1db3544b5db2f4e70661ac.jpg", "website": "http://www.oharock.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Oh, a Rock!
