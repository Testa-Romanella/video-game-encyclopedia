Recoil is modeled in as well, so make sure to aim before your shots go astray. <br/><br/>Ammunition is limited! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Your enemies are going to give you a headache. The AI hears your steps and shots. It will hunt and pursue you and shoots accurately. Watch your cover, because the AI will act as a team.
