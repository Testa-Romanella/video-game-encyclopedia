Use them wisely!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a submission to the United Game Jam, the theme of the game jam was \"two\". The way it relates to the theme is with the twice part of \"You Only Live Twice\".</p>\n<p>There are 5 intro/tutorial levels and 3 actual puzzle levels. The game turned out easier than I'd like it to be. It could be made more varied, interesting and difficult with more mechanics: levers, breakable platforms, etc.</p>\n<p>Used assets:</p>\n<ol><li>https://s4m-ur4i.itch.io/huge-pixelart-asset-pack<br/></li><li>https://shapeforms.itch.io/cassette</li><li>https://beepyeah.itch.io/8-bit-sfx-pack</li><li>https://outspacer.itch.io/platformer-sfx</li></ol>\n<p>Made with the wonderful Godot engine!<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it!
