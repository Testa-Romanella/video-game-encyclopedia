Futhorc Escape!</strong>\r\nGame Jam 2020 Submission\r\n<p>You must escape the room, but your way is blocked. Complete the statues, piece together a riddle to escape!</p>\n<p>A submission for Ryan Laley's Game Jam 2020, where the theme was escaping a room. This is the first video game I have ever made, and apart from fonts, I made everything myself solo from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: It may help to speak the words aloud once you've got them translated in your head.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>I recommend the Windows x86 / x86_64 executables (v1.1 - scroll down)</strong><br/></p>\r\nUpdate: v1.1 should be considered my submission to Game Jam 2020.\r\n<p>The WebGL version is pretty awful, (I included it last minute)\u00a0but for the most part the windows builds are stable. So I suggest you play the Windows versions,\u00a0<strong>not</strong> the WebGL version.</p>\n<p>I also uploaded the unity project for this. It's a bloated mess, with superfluous code at the best of times, and at worst entire repeats of whole blocks just because I couldn't find a bug and thought it might help to just repeat stuff. Then of course, finding the fix was some small line you forgot about, then being too time pressured/stressed/tired/lazy to go back and remove the crazy mess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But oh well, I learnt a lot from this, and I'll do it better next time.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun, and a lot of stress, doing this game jam, learning a lot of stuff as I go. I'll definitely want to do another one sometime! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:38:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/481ef396bc1f82652ba3833d0e9bedc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JosephCFRothwell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
