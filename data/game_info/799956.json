Every day you had the pleasure of making sure every worker in the building arrived safe and sound to their destinations. You were the happiest person on Earth, and only death could change that... and so it did. One tragic night, just before your work day was over, you suffered a heart attack and because you were mid-way between floors, you ended up dying right there, on the elevator.\u00a0Most people go either to heaven or hell when they die, but not you, YOU STAYED! Now, you are a ghost lamp living peacefully in the elevator, still helping people get up and down the building.\u00a0\u00a0You may not be the happiest person alive anymore, but you are the happiest ghost ever dead.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you are not alone in this world. At night, while no one is watching, ghost moths come looking for the light, seeking to consume it. YOU are the light, and need to defend yourself from those moths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>SAVE YOUR LIGHT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:56:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aabf442559614bccc063403360e9a14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferchus", "LuisAngel Music"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
