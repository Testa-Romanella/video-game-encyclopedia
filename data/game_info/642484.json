Consensus (or win-win solution) is crucial for many controversial problems in business and in public policies but it is very hard to achieve because of the differences in the interests of participants AND because, sometimes, the process of discussion is not efficiently organized.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Experienced facilitators of group discussions say that the participants perform better if they know what to expect from the process. People who can\u2019t stop talking, people who are staying silent most of the time, people who interrupt others \u2013 all these are common behaviors that we can observe during group meetings. It\u2019s useful to know how to deal with such challenges and bring the dialog back to the constructive mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>Play this <strong>explorable explanation</strong> to learn about the group discussion challenges and ways to overcome them!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions: participate in research</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This explorable explanation is a part of a PhD research project conducted at PERSWADE Center and Games Studio, University of Technology Sydney.
