The user is a high top secret priority agent where gives to the program, given high priority orders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Main purpose:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is mainly played by two, where one is the Prime Minister and the other is the top-secret agent.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister gives a call to the contact\u00a0(top-secret agent) and gives direct orders to search in the database for a known target. But to get the info the top-secret agent (user of the program), needs to follow some easy but time taking and maybe, just maybe, smaller efforts to complete the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the top agent succeed or what will the consequences be?</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Folder information:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The .zip file includes the .exe file and a .dll that is required to run the program correctly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional information:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Icon source:</p>\n<p>https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpixy.org%2F98382%2F&amp;psig=AOvVa...<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>OBSERVE!</strong></p>\n<p>A friend of mine tried to download it and his antivirus Norton flagged the file as \"wisdom of the crowds\"!</p>\n<p>This is the definition in quotes:</p>\n<p>\"The reputation-based system uses \"the wisdom of crowds\" (Symantec\u2019s tens of millions of end-users)\u00a0<br/>connected to cloud-based intelligence to compute a reputation score for an application, and in the\u00a0<br/>process identify malicious software in an entirely new way beyond traditional signatures and\u00a0<br/>behavior-based detection techniques.\"</p>\n<p>It's nothing to worry about!
