Each enemy whether human or not, has its own behaviour patterns which will require players to adapt to their fighting technique. The levels are created not only horizontally but vertically, so the player will be able to solve every skirmish in a variety of ways. Beware, the enemies aren't the only dangers of this world: deadly traps and chasms await for those not paying attention.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Skill Based First Person Melee Combat<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLearn the behaviour of your enemies and slay them with instant weapon swap combos. Remember, melee only, no shooting! Oh, and watch out: everyone dies quickly, and so do you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Environmental Story Telling<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLearn the story through your surroundings however you see fit: no taking control from the player, no forced storytelling.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-08T18:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c39a481cb165b17ed17fadf90b82a7.jpg", "website": "http://hyperstrange.com", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 832, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 16, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 565, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hyperstrange"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyperstrange"], "esrb_rating": null}
