But what does it mean?\"<br/><br/>City of Edges is a walking simulator that tells the story of a misfit: you, made of \"roundness\", in a city full of sharp and broken edges.  In this 30-60 minute game, you will wander across this unfriendly place in search of answers and, eventually, others that are also unique in their own way.<br/><br/>Take your time and explore this world.
