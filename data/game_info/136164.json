There are<strong> three stages</strong> and in between each <strong>you have to place two turrets</strong>. <strong>BUT</strong> these are <strong>enemy turrets</strong>, they make the game <strong>harder</strong>. The shield blocks<strong> <em>your shots only</em></strong>, the turrets shoots bullet that <em><strong>hurt you</strong></em> and the warper screws up<strong> </strong><em><strong>your speed</strong></em>. All of that is perfectly intended behavior :). You just get too chose what kind of pain you want to experience.</p>\n<p>The game isn\u2019t actually that hard once you figure out turrets combination and the way you\u2019re supposed to play it.
