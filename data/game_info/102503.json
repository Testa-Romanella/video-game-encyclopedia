Katakana\" is the second in a series of educational tools that I developed. It is designed to test your knowledge of the Japanese Katakana syllabary by using a multiple choice quiz format. It is almost like flash cards.</p><p>This game is for anyone trying to learn Katakana, or and at a point where they wonder if they've truly mastered it. If you can score high enough, you should be confident that you're ready to move on. By trial and error, you can rapidly figure out where your weaknesses are and improve. <br/><br/>Version 1.1 was released on November 30th, 2015 for Android, Windows, Mac and Linux, and developed with the Ren'Py visual novel engine. This version has enhanced assets funded by the Kickstarter!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9dfc2ea6ae13da327688ac729c3138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Motoko"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
