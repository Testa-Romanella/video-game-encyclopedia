How about adding a life threatening situation? Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConcentrate hard on moving the trampoline to keep your friends from suffering a horrible fate, all while pulling off mega cool tricks! The tricks get cooler as the fun meter goes up, so don't let anything bad happen (that would be a total bummer!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the mouse to move the trampoline left and right, while moving the cursor over the jumper's orbs to do tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSubmit your score to the online leaderboard to see how you match up with players from around the world. See if you can make the top 100 all time in total score, most tricks, or longest time.
