Something in your heart whispers of shade, majesty, and acorns. What does this mean?</p>\n<p>Your mother waves to the east. On the far side of the ocean is a world! Plants and animals! Mountains and valleys! Birds and flowers and a forest of mighty oaks. Yes! You know that this is who and what you are meant to be: an oak.</p>\n<p>Your parents can&#39;t teach you how to be an oak. The only one who can teach you how to be an oak is another oak. Still, your parents teach you what they can - the way of the coconut. This will give you the ability to cross to the mainland, and be one step closer to your goal. It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s a start!</p>\n<p>In Sprout, you will embark on a casual, botanical-puzzle-adventure. You will make friends, learn new skills, solve puzzles, and ultimately become the mighty oak that you were always meant to be.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-03T11:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/782/7823872c22c8dfba307b4a8fd245b52d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 193, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mindful Mammoth", "Jeff Nusz", "Sparkee Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mindful Mammoth", "Sparkee Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
