As you explore and interact with other soldiers on the battlefield along with some of the demons, most questions than answers are presented. <br/></p>\n<p>The game's special combat mechanic are shields.</p>\n<p>Shields come in anti-magic and anti-physical. Anti-magic reflects all magic attacks while anti-physical will always allow the player to counter attack physical attacks. Only one can be applied on a character at a time and they can be destroyed by enemies casing a shield break aliment, this last until the character's next turn to take double damage. But if they aren't destroyed, they will stay until the end of battle. Players and enemies can both use them. Risk vs reward. <br/></p>\n<p>Enemy demons can be captured using Monstrum-Captio Cards. You can train them to be stronger, or you can sell ALL your demons for some cash based on their EXP. You can also buy demons as well. This creates a satisfying loop of capturing demons, selling them, buying what you need with other demons to catch more demons. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>The full game is still in development.</p>\n<p>Here is what I want for it:</p>\n<p>&gt;7 chapters with a fully developed in-depth story, cast, and characters<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;7 dungeons</p>\n<p>&gt;3 endings</p>\n<p>&gt;Around 20 boss battles<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;At least 100 playable demon characters (This will take most of the development by far)<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;50-60+ music tracks (most of this is done already at this point.)</p>\n<p>The demo takes 20 minutes to beat if you rush to the boss. If you want to explore and do all the side quests, then it will take around an hour to complete.</p><br/>\n<p>Please leave feedback under the comments as I would really like to read what people think about the demo and what I can change in the future to make it the best game it can be. Also, report any bugs you might get, some are due to some plugins I used (very rare bugs that I can't fix) but I don't know of all the bugs even after playtesting. I'll try to respond when I can. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T05:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/260df4bdbd639951e3a749e75bbbb01f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Evilous"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
