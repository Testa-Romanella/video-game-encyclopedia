When he rolls, the number that is facing up when Lucky gets hit\u00a0will cause either blessing or curses for him. Survive as long as possible to get the highest score (which you can post below in the comments). White dice represents your current number on top and the blue dice represents your health. Also, <strong>NO DIAGONAL ROLLING</strong>. When doing a horizontal roll, you switch between the numbers 1, 2 and 3. When doing a vertical roll, you switch between 4, 5 and 6 (the 2nd tutorial screen isn't correct and the <strong>HORIZONTAL ROLL NUMBERS AND VERTICAL ROLL NUMBERS ARE REVERESED</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Takago - Programmer, Lead Game Designer</p>\n<p>Miyaki - Pixel Artist, SFX Artist</p>\n<p>sproutser.art - Vector Artist, Music Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0af69465cfb9bab955b43d81962b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
