To accomplish this, War of Ashird uses a combination of systems: Normal battles are grid-based, with up to 7 characters engaging an enemy army. When fighting a boss, laying siege to a castle, or conquering new territory, however, the game uses a turn-based battle system with three party members instead.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>A world full of possibilities:</strong> You can visit 20 cities, each with their own story, character events, and guild quests. By exploring all of them, maybe you'll uncover some mysteries\u2026?<br/><br/></li><li><strong>More than 20 playable characters with a unique personality: </strong>Build your team with over 20 unique characters where each of them has their stories and personality.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Own land and become lord of a castle:</strong> Who wouldn't want to be master of their own domain\u2014and who wouldn't want to expand it further? But wait\u2026 if you have a castle, you'll need a helpful maid to take care of it! As your rank rises in Ceredia, you'll get your own land, a castle, and one of four lovely servants.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Forge your own story:</strong> You can decide how to finish certain tasks and missions, which will shape your character as the game goes on. Are you going to protect your kingdom, or are you going to destroy it\u2014along with everything else? The choice is yours.<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df6/df6208dd9a0213288c738bc204847e44.jpg", "website": "http://www.kumihosoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kumiho Soft", "Igrasil Development Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Igrasil Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
