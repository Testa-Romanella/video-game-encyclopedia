They used these vehicles to improvise illegal races (unbeknownst to the company that owns the station) on a long trail that was used in the past as a hub for transporting goods on the colonies around Saturn. The Jammy-N6 was not driven directly by humans, but by the so-called DR-Drones, robots trained solely for driving anti-gravity vehicles and spaceships. Each DR-Drone was connected to its human pilot via a remote neural link, receiving instructions or commands during the race. <strong>THE CUBERACE WAS BORN</strong>.<strong>NOW (YEAR 2168)</strong>The human population has reached 17 billion people, of which about 143000 on the Moon colonies, 28000 on the large colony \"Osiridon\" of Mars and other 3000 humans scattered around the other 35 colonies and outposts of the solar system (not counting all the staff of the military bases). Living on the colonies of the Moon and Mars has become a luxury for those who can afford it, VIPs and celebrities await months to have their space passport, events and shows are continuously organized in interplanetary streaming.
