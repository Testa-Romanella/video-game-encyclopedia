This is a small platformer where the objective is to collect acorns and make your way through the levels. The concept was that\u00a0you would slowly evolve new abilities after submerging yourself in toxic lakes. The little slug guy is inspired by the Slugcat creature from Rain World.</p>\n<p>This literally has only one playable level, so once you make it past the flag that's the end of the game. Try and make it to the end as fast as possible, and see if you can collect the secret golden acorn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce4ba8d862270048e873d2a01f0a70ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["digimus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
