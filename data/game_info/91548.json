You can then send that data back to Earth in exchange for spacesuit upgrades that allow you to further explore the planet's depths.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Star Surveyor is currently <strong>in development </strong>, but you can download a demo of the game below.</p>\n<p><strong>freesound contributors</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tangeliqueperdike; samararaine; j1987; fins; chriddof; andromadax24\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\toceanictrancer; tiptoe84; bmusic92; paul368; 123jorre456; rhodesmas\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tmaxthrower; jamesrodavidson; oscaraudiogeek; owlstorm; swuing; vataaa\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tadam-n; jorickhoofd; klankbeeld; dave-welsh; justkiddink; ueffects; vrodge\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b7339a5b655b9a037666061d3d4be385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["slimefriend"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
