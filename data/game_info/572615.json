Can you swipe your way to level 10 and beat the Vampire Queen?</em>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0It is highly recommended\u00a0you download this game instead of using WebGL, as WebGL is known to be buggier than a downloaded copy.</strong></p>\n<p>Character art with exception of the demon is currently placeholder as our character artist ran out of time with other commitments. Please enjoy as is :)</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Swipe on enemies with a heart or a skull. A heart has a chance (shown on hover) to recruit the enemy to your side and let you use their ability.</p>\n<p>Use Vibes in battle to power your attacks. Get vibes from cards! Keep a balance of attacking, defending, and vibe cards!</p>\n<p>Level up by defeating enemies and gathering upgrades. Helpful NPCs may also show up along your journey to assist you!</p>\n<p>Made in March 2021 for the 7DRL challenge.</p>\n<p>UI art, music, code, design by Jet Simon</p>\n<p>Character art by Ngan Hoang (https://nganhoang.ca/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50b/50bc1d703e9b2f78cc0a17eb09c6192b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jet Simon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
