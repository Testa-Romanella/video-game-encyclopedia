Featuring fast-paced movement, fun guns, a simple but nice low-poly artstyle and loads more!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is still in active development, and this is a Beta / Demo for the final game. The final game will include much more content, polish and bugfixes. If you want to follow development of the game, then subscribe to my\u00a0YouTube channel\u00a0for devlogs.</p>\n<p>There are probably\u00a0bugs and lots of small issues in the game right now, its really helpful if you report them in the comments, but please keep in mind that its still in active development and\u00a0\u00a0there will be bugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>REQUIRES AT LEAST 2 PLAYERS, ONE WITH A GAMEPAD!</p>\n<p>READ CONTROLS BEFORE PLAYING!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keyboard and Mouse on left, Gamepads on right !</p>\n<ul><li>Move - WASD and Mouse / Left and Right Sticks</li><li>Shoot -\u00a0Left Click\u00a0 / Right Trigger</li><li>Crouch - Left Control /\u00a0 X/\u00a0 Square</li><li>Jump - Space / A /\u00a0 X</li><li>Reload - R / B/ Circle</li><li>Pickup Weapon - Right Click\u00a0(Keyboard)/Y (Xbox) / Triangle (PS)</li><li>Drop\u00a0Weapon -\u00a0 F/ Left Bumper</li><li>TAB - Pause Menu</li><li>Throw Grenade - G/Right Bumper</li><li>Punch - V/Click Right Joystick</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>How To Start</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Run the executable after extracting the zip file. Then either press left click on the mouse if you want the first player to be keyboard and mouse, or the a button on the controller if you want the first player to be controller. Keep in mind that you will still have to use the mouse for menus (which I\u00a0hope to change in the future)\u00a0and that players 2 - 4 cannot use the keyboard and mouse, it must be the first player. After that, simply press a on the other controllers you wish to use and then go through the menu (press play, then arcade, then play again) and you will start the game!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The graphics settings don't appear to be working, I\u00a0will fix this soon.\u00a0</li><li>The melee knockback is super unpredictable.</li><li>Weapon pickups will sometimes fall through the floor.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Goals and Plans</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game is in an early, but playable state. I have plans to add more content to the game, specifically as more settings, stages, guns, mechanics and gamemodes. Some Ideas I\u00a0have are:</p>\n<ul><li>A Halo-style arena mode with game types like capture the flag and free for all.</li><li>\u00a0An Outrun themed area with wall running and portals.</li><li>A lot more customization and settings to make the experience more customizable and accessible.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>0.5 Changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The biggest update yet!\u00a0</li><li>New type of weapon, throwables!</li><li>The first throwable, the grenade, it explodes</li><li>Melee attacks</li><li>More polished gun animations</li><li>The forest area is no more, say hello to the Oriental area!</li><li>3 Brand new stages!</li><li>Reworked Pickup Spawner</li><li>More sensitivity settings</li><li>Removed a ton of bugs, added a ton of bugs</li><li>added Linux version for all 3 of you</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/104ee7598944cd608727f8f6df3cd76f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Butwhylevin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
