This is a quantum puzzle game! You can just play it for fun, or you can use it to conduct scientific research in the field of quantum error correction.<br/><br/>These are the puzzles that need to be solved to keep quantum computers free of errors. We need to work out the best way to do it. By becoming a master at this game, you could help build a real-life quantum computer.<br/><br/>Check out our website for more details on the science behind the game.<br/><br/>This app was developed by Dr James Wootton, a quantum error correction researcher at the University of Basel. It is supported by the NCCR QSIT.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab19b4f91b4a87224f86ad83f2d04486.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Decodoku"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
