It consists mainly of hills, slopes and mountains. Anything else, such as buildings, is rare.</p>\n<h3>Player Classes</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of a match, each player chooses a character class. Classes are only three. Class can be changed during the game.</p>\n<p>Light class - health and weapons of this class are weak, but this class has a high speed, it can become invisible and attack at a great distance from the sniper rifle. He is the best if you need to steal a flag or catch up with those who have already done it.</p>\n<p>The middle class is average in everything - in health, armament and mobility. But this is not only the average level of everything, it is also a good balance between all the qualities.</p>\n<p>Heavy class has the largest health reserve and powerful heavy weapons. Equally good in attack and defense, but moves slower than all, sluggish.</p>\n<h3>Special equipment and abilities</h3>\n<p>All three classes have a jetpack, allowing you to fly through the air. But the height of the climb depends on the chosen character class. All characters can slide on the surface, the speed of sliding is high, but depends on the mass of the character, and hence, on his class.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Team fight.<br />\nCapture and retention.<br />\nCapture the Flag, CtF is the main game mode.
