The survivors are scattered and cut off, and few remain who continue to fight the seemingly pointless struggle. A small crew of Space Pilots have volunteered to stay behind and evacuate as many civilians as possible. The Pilots have taken their old ExoArmor Mechs out of storage and are eager to dust off their combat experience. Fight to save innocent lives, or simply out of spite, but fight! <br/><br/>Hold off the Slimes and evacuate the civilians! You are the only thing standing in between assimilation and survival. That evac ship is the one way off this planet! Make your sacrifice count. <br/><br/><strong>Mechs<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fury</strong> is a more traditional bipedal mech with rapid firing auto-cannons that destroy everything in their path. The auto cannon takes a moment to wind up. Hold click to fire. Watch out for weapon jams!</li><li><strong>Stormclaw</strong> is a more technologically advanced hover mech with a laser for burning slimes. Watch your heat levels!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>W- Move Forward <br/>A- Move Left <br/>S- Move Backward<br/> D- Move Right<br/> Left Click- Fire<br/>Right Click- Zoom<br/>F- Enable full screen and mouse lock (if needed)<br/><br/><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Programming/Modelling/Animations:\u00a0James \"JamesTKhan\" Pooley<br/>Artwork/Story:\u00a0Mike Adcock<br/><br/><strong>Voices:<br/></strong>Fury: Mike Adcock<br/>Stormclaw: JamesTKhan<br/>Capt.
