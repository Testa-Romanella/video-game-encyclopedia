Just play it! <br/></p>\n<p>Also - there's a beachball in the game - if i have to explain you wouldn't understand.<br/></p>\n<p>As you can see from the screenshots it is strongly influenced by the '80 retro-futuristic style, Synthwave/Outrun and the old intro for Jonny Quest.</p>\n<p>The game is short - but I can see myself turning it into something more. If You  feel like playing the game more - please leave a comment, or a dollar, \u00a0that would get me motivated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe one day a future version of Retro-Active could be a 'Games You Might Not Have Tried'.<br/></p>\n<p>The source-code for this game is available under the GNU GPL license, if you want to run the game from source you will need to install Python 3.x and Panda3D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf45b1347ac8d9564664e7d6ea798667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["wezu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
