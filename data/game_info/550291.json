{"id": 550291, "slug": "project-astro", "name": "Project Astro", "name_original": "Project Astro", "description": "<p>Project Astro</p>\n<p>Imagine living on your own with no one around on a brand new planet or is it. No matter the distance you travel and the caves you find for shelter,\u00a0 you must find a way to leave this planet or call it your new home. The main character Astro walks around a newly discovered planet with the intention to find a way out from a planet that nearly killed. Astro must travel to learn his surroundings and collect useful supplies to survive another day. Solve puzzles, learn your surroundings, and explore.</p>\n<p>Project Astro provides a lot of backstory on why I came up with an idea to make an adventure game. Project Astro contains a personal story that is yet to be discovered from the player but from my side and it shows how I express my feelings in a game. I wanted to show how I view my life 85% of the time which is alone and in peace, just like Project Astro the main character starts out alone on a planet exploring, and maybe, in the end, he/she enjoys the peace and quiet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd7feedcc08d29cba9e2702cf9aea60a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jerry_M_92"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
