We are just developers who make games for fun so we do not have a real reason to get one. We are sorry if you receive the windows message but we hope you will look past it and enjoy our game anyway :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef2/ef207f1fd59d4205d7ab4b59f71124dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Albatroop"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
