{"id": 742164, "slug": "gradient-bridge", "name": "Gradient Bridge", "name_original": "Gradient Bridge", "description": "<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys </strong>- Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Dash</p>\n<p><strong>C</strong> - Change ghost color once you find new colors</p>\n\n<p>How does one build peace between two hostile factions?\u00a0 Does making them realize that they're not so different after all suffice? Well, it's worth a try.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What's Going on Here?</strong></p>\n<p>In <em>Gradient Bridge</em>, you control a determined ghost who is trying to bring an end to a conflict. For some unknown reason, the warring factions' greatest weapons, their turrets, have temporarily become inactive. Before the time runs out, you must find and use the appropriate colors to build the \"gradient bridge\". If successful, you will be able to stop the war. If you fail...well, let's not talk about that right now.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT HOW?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As you explore the game map, you will come across different areas where the colors you need can be extracted from glowing blocks. To perform the extraction, make a dash and hit the block. This will change the ghost's color to whatever was on that block. Then, head back to the initial area to color the appropriate block.</p>\n<p><strong>WOW!... A MENIAL TASK, ISN'T IT?</strong></p>\n<p>Being a ghost certainly helps with your movement, but lights can be deadly since they have UV characteristics. If the light source and\u00a0your ghost's color are the same, then you can safely travel. If not, you DIE.</p>\n\n<p>Developed by Arcan Kavuzlu for GDevelop Game Jam #1</p>\n\n<p>All Sound FX &amp; Game Assets were created By Arcan Kavuzlu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:02:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31f6e2cffa1726f751414293d89974be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Glume Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
