{"id": 535097, "slug": "botsistance", "name": "botsistance", "name_original": "botsistance", "description": "<p>Botsistance is a Dungeon Crawler made for the Secret Santa Jam. It offers 10 levels, 2 bosses, and an arcade mode. The fight system is simple, click on your enemies and either push or pull them! This allows for many interesting tactics where you turn your enemies against themselves. I plan on adding another 5 levels on January 1st, 2021. <br/></p>\n<p>The story is set in the future, where there are 3 factions: Humans, Green Bots, and Purple Bots. One day, the humans waged war against the bots, and lost. Afterwards, the Green Bots thought there would be peace, but the Purple Bots thought otherwise; Because they were more vast in number, the Green Bots had to surrender. They still exist, but are mostly used as slaves. Fortunately, there are a few Green Bots who are looking to form a resistance, will you help them?</p>\n<p>source code<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b7561a8a569dcac1d1f22b77f5732bf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["maskarinec"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
