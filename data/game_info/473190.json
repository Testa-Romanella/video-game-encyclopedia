For this project I wanted to share a relatively new solution for a real world out of control problem, forest fires. In recent years with the combination of global warming and forest fire prevention, forest fires have become more dangerous and more out of control. With controlled burns we can help keep forest safe and healthy and prevent out of control fires from happening in the future.\u00a0<br/><br/>Any donations to this project will be directed towards forest fire emergency funds and forest preservation projects. Donating directly is also recommended.<br/><br/>directrelief.org/emergency/wildfire/<br/>https://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief/wildfire-relief.html<br/>https://lp.panda.org/bushfire-appeal<br/><br/>https://www.nationalforests.org/get-involved/ways-to-give<br/>https://www.rainforesttrust.org/<br/>https://teamtrees.org/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7dacc22f584af1358adf32540a364f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["greydavenport"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
