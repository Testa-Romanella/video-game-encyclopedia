Undiscovered constellations and celestial bodies move across the sky above you as you explore, illuminating new secrets to discover.<h3>Circles:</h3>A spelunking adventure within a vast, mystical cave. Unlock and interact with the mysteries of the Circles as you make your way through an ancient cave system.<h3>Emotion:</h3>Set in a verdant, lush plateau, explore the remnants of a lost tribe as they try to tell you their stories through flickering artefacts. Relax in a stoic experience atop the cliffs; but stay away from the edges.<h3>Faithless:</h3>A dense, forested jungle is littered with bioluminescent flora, surrounding a mystic river. Cliffs and otherworldly plants keep vantage points well-hidden. Daylight cycles are extremely short, so plan your explorations wisely.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/831685e59746f738e65826458180a60a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metamo Industries"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["MYRNE"], "esrb_rating": null}
