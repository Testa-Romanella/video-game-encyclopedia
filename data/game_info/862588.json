Avoid getting hit by the moving red blocks, and hit the robot in the middle.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I didn't get everything I wanted to do with this game done. I had this idea first, but then decided to make a grid based 2D version for some reason. I didn't like the direction that was going, so started again with this on Sunday. As a result, it's missing some stuff. I wanted to have additional smaller enemies scattered around the ring you could attack, as well as some health packs, an upgrade system, animations, and really a bunch of other stuff. But I suppose that's just the way these things go sometimes. Overall I enjoyed making this, and I learned some new things about Godot to do with procedural mesh generation (the blocks are all procedurally generated), so I'm glad I pushed through to the end.\r\n</p>\n<p>Changelog\r\n</p>\n<p>-Fixed bug that stopped your being hit if you didn't move\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df1affab0d24f288281b3c75349fdde4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Aragatodag"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
