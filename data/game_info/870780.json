So I was following the Unity Essentials Pathway and got to the 2D sprite pachinko challenge.<br/><br/>After doing the required prototype I remember what others indie developers said: \"The hard part is finishing a game\".<br/><br/>Knowing this I started thinking about how hard it would be to finish a game based on my prototype, and the result is this little game called FruitChinko.<br/><br/>It took me just\u00a0around 15 hours of work, doing it a little every night after my day job but it is done. It's a very short time, but considering the initial prototype was done in less than one hour and everything else was polishing and extra features shows what takes longer in the process.<br/><br/>Finishing the game, even a super simple one like this, was the best practice I could have wished for. So, if you are also working on prototypes for tutorials like me, try to finish them, it's the hardest and at the same time the best part.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66936d605ad252d9fdc6f256a51821a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HenryMenegale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
