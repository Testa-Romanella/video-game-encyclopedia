In fact, I used it to learn a little bit about\u00a0raylib and C. I might do better quality projects with raylib in the future, but I just wanted to get a quick project finished due to this being my first raylib\u00a0and C project ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pong is the first video game, you basically bounce a ball between two paddles (white rectangles) and try to score by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle. In this version, once a player gets 8 points, he wins. The game will automatically reset for continued gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>Education:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This project might also serve as a quick example for those wanting to first learn raylib\u00a0or C.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1: w = up, s = down</p>\n<p>Player 2: arrow keys up and down</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T04:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e509c2302531d669879b1d78a553b5e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thbop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
