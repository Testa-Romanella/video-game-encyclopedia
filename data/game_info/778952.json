You have to click on the stumps to turn them towards cupcakes of the right color. A pig will automatically eject from the stump when the stump faces a cupcake of the same color. The puzzle is over when all cupcakes are eaten.<br/><br/>Secondary color pigs can eat secondary colored cupcakes, as well as the primary colors that make up their secondary color.\u00a0<br/>Example, a green pig can eat blue, yellow, and green cupcakes.</p>\n<p>I like this mechanic. I may reuse it in future projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T10:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb49024b1c9e661d886b9795e98c086f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nabladeveloper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
