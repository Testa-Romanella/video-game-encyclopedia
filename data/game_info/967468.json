{"id": 967468, "slug": "shelter-in-the-doomsday", "name": "Shelter in the Doomsday", "name_original": "Shelter in the Doomsday", "description": "<strong>The first independently developed role-playing game targeting all age groups for casual decompression, with a 2D horizontal version, mainly focused on defense and adventure, with storyline tasks, capable of collecting and building, spreading the positive energy of helping others.</strong><br/><br/>Similar to the controllable character version of 'Fallout Shelter', for those who like the action control mechanism of the hardcore platform like 'Demon City' and have high requirements for a sense of impact, please be cautious when choosing. Due to limited development experience, we will continue to optimize and improve in the future.<br/><br/>If you have any suggestions or need help, please send me an email. Thank you again!<br/><br/><strong>***Please subscribe to the Steam Creative Workshop and successfully download the image resource package before playing the game***<br/>The character portraits and scene images of the game can be downloaded from the 'Creative Workshop'<br/>Some game controllers have been mapped, please download them in \"Controller Settings\"</strong><br/><br/>The game lasts about 12 hours, and the expert level difficulty of unlocking after clearance is about 15 hours.<br/>In the later stage, new tasks and characters will be added for free, and creative workshops will also gradually display different styles of vertical drawing image resource packs.<br/><br/><strong>Defense\u00a0Home:</strong><br/>There are approximately 7 categories and over 80 types of enemies and
