It's just a bit of fun for a group of idiots.<br/></p>\n<p>Taking place some time after the events of the original Ainsley's Nights of Hell, the unnamed and conveniently featureless protagonist awakens after supposedly being kidnapped on their way home from the hellish restaurant(?). Once again they must face against familiar foes as well as some new, equally terribly photoshopped faces. Only this time, they may not be completely alone...</p>\n<p>Fight for survival in familiar, new and somewhat unrealistic environments!</p>\n<p>Use your actual human legs to work in a different fucking room for once in a while!</p>\n<p>Keep a watchful eye out for any secrets to uncover the mystery of why everything is the way it is! (and what is mentally wrong with me for coming up with it in the first place!)</p>\n<p>All of this and more in this obscure Five Nights piss-take that I am putting way too much effort into that for some reason stars AINSLEY FUCKING HARRIOTT... among others!</p>\n<p>(This game was originally posted on Gamejolt and I am very new to Itch.io. Apologies is this is very messy. And before you say it, yes, I only posted it here because I am a desperate little bitch. Also Gamejolt is somewhat annoying.
