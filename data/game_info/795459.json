{"id": 795459, "slug": "operation-defensive", "name": "Operation Defensive!", "name_original": "Operation Defensive!", "description": "Operation Defensive is a tower defense game but instead of monsters following a track, it's a player. So instead of watching enemies follow a track for no reason, watch them attack a player instead. But dont just stand there--fight back with towers! Towers dont really aim so much, so it's your job to lead enemies into your traps!<br/>\r\nYou can play multiple different themes, all with unique different enemies and tower skins, and some with bosses.<br/>\r\nIf you ever feel like the game is too difficult, there are settings for extra starting cash and a heal at the end of each round. Just know that these help settings don't work on bosses. And remember to have fun :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T04:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854f5e892cd784466f588bc02be21eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazarfisch"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lazarfisch"], "esrb_rating": null}
