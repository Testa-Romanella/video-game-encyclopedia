I introduce to you \"The Banrkeeper\", a game where you play as a former female slave called Ren\u00e9e, who escaped an exploitation during the American civil war in 1862. You get trapped in a mysterious barn where you will have to find the exit\u00a0while being hunted by a monster. Throughout the game you will discover the truth about what was going on in this barn...<br/></p>\n<p>This game takes about 20 min to complete if you're playing normally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>Move - Z, Q, S, D</p>\n<p>Lantern - A</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n<p>Climb - F</p>\n<p>Inventory - TAB</p>\n<p>Pause - Escape</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Artists :</strong></p>\n<p>- Clothilde Arlaut\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/clothilde-arlaut</p>\n<p>- Th\u00e9o Durand\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/theo-durand</p>\n<p>- Joey Cournez</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designers :</strong></p>\n<p>- Joseph Pelloquet\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/jojo8210</p>\n<p>- Samuel Arsac\u00a0https://samuel-arsac.itch.io/</p>\n<p>- Me, Vincent Py\u00a0https://healingstorm.itch.io/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Designer :</strong></p>\n<p>- Roxane Pilot,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/PilotRoxane<br/></p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQAUrWsZcHGI6VYyw_QHzQ?view_as=subscriber</p>\n\n<p>Have fun playing it !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0ccc206c039bad74f9fc594bff50adeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HealingStorm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
