In Blockscapes, we took the \"frantically\" out, and replaced it with a relaxing and untimed quest to fit different combinations of tetrominos together to fill distinct shapes.<br/><br/>Tap a piece to rotate it and then drag it into position. Use 3D Touch if you need to spin it again along the way. All the while, enjoy breathtaking vistas in the distance, from Californian cliffs to Icelandic auroras.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T22:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70b0a02d407fa9bd6a48eeeadd58d4a6.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/candywriter", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Candywriter"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Candywriter"], "esrb_rating": null}
