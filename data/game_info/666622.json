It is featured in every level. The rope, however, is very weak. It's\u00a0<strong>on the edge\u00a0</strong>of breaking. So in some levels, the helpers may put pressure on the rope and cause it to fall or snap.</p>\r\nThe helpers are your friends that you exploit for your own needs. You can\u00a0<strong>boss\u00a0</strong>them around in various ways, like summoning them or pushing them.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6609040baf665280f76936cc1e909ee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr.Mango"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
