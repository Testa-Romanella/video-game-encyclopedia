You play as a genius inventor that customized his own wheelchair with a jetpack and harpoon guns as he was sick of missing his lifts when they arrived.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to make it to the end of each level as fast as possible, using the tools at your disposal to clear the massive caps, spikes and button operated doors.</p>\n<p>This is our team's second game jam project and was unfortunately not completely finished to the standard we wanted due to time constraints but our main goal was to at least show the premiss of the game even if it was a bit janky and missing sound effects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The team Responsible for this project are Blappy Productions:</p>\n<p>Clare McAlister () - Producer and Level Designer</p>\n<p>Brandon McRae (Me, <strong>HalfHollow</strong>) - Programmer</p>\n<p>Connor Currie (<strong>StarscapeDev</strong>)- UI designer</p>\n<p>Nathan Warren (<strong>nathanwarren7080</strong>)- Level Designer</p><p>How it fits the theme: The player is given a jetpack which is intended to \"lift\" them over obstacles. The game is also a play on the slang\u00a0\u00a0term for cabs sense the player is in a rush to get to their \"lift\" using their \"lifting jetpack\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T09:59:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/debca5b9e6c8cd40cf82fc2a6ffa3935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HalfHollow"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
