Besides moving through space by going left or right, we also navigate our character forward and backwards in time. However, when we choose to go backwards we do so in the memory of the main protagonist who has a very vivid memory. Therefor the game constantly switches betweem reality and memory, and what seems obvious in reality is not always obvious in memory.</p><p>Keys: WASD, Space to jump<br/><br/>Made by Christian Krogh, Joakim Old Jensen, Christina Exner and Daniel Thiesen at Nordic Game Jam 1015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25ca63b9e333570cd73aa6d21704f33d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["RestInCheese"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
