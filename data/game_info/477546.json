Play as the green ship that can move but shooting is automatic based on targets in reach of the laser sight. Enemies drop pick ups that increase your control bar. Losing control means a special attack is unleashed. You are invulnerable but your ally is not. Sound was not included due to reaching time limit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:21:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb3d3970c9bedbdbe1c02b08aae3ad37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["the fony"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
