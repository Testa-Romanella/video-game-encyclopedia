The city has falling to the edge of oblivion. The chaos and the crime took over the streets of Aurora. The violence has reached its peak, no place is more safer. Risking their lives to restore peace, they confront aggressiveness even of those who once swore to protect us.<br/><br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aurorafightgame/</p>\n<p> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/aurorafight/<br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u2193\u2193\u2193 NOTE VERSION ALPHA 0.2-\u00a0\u00a029/01/2018 !!! \u2193\u2193\u2193<br/><br/></p><p>- This version \u00a0has support <strong>partial </strong>for joystick.</p><p>- Bugs fixed</p><p>- Game with better performace</p><p><strong>ATTENTION: For some interactions, it is necessary to use the mouse.</strong></p><p>\u00a0\u2193\u2193\u2193 IMPORTANT!!! \u2193\u2193\u2193<br/></p>\n<p>Aurora Fight does NOT need to be installed.<br/></p>\n<p>Available only in SINGLE PLAYER mode.<br/></p>\n<p>Commands:<br/></p>\n<p>Movement - ARROW KEYS or \"W\", \"A\", \"S\", \"D\".</p>\n<p>\"P\" - Pause \"G\" - Punch1 / Pick Weapon\u00a0\r\n\"H\" - Kick / Pick Weapon\r\n\"J\" - Punch2 / Pick Weapon\r\n\"R\" - Rage (Special)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Developer - Henrique Gon\u00e7alves\r\n</p>\n<p>Linkedin -\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrique-gon%C3%A7alves-71a0044b/</p>\n\n<p>Artist - Icaro Cesar</p>\n<p>Linkedin -\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/icaro-correia-b2a836135/<br/></p>\r\nAwards:\u00a0\r\nBrazil - SBGAMES 2017", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82a6ab3b86d78af4af0f89f3fb202a43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aurora Fight"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
