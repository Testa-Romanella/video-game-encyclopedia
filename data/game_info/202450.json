I liked the concept so much that I made a design document and schedule to work on it during the summer of 2015. However; I decided to suspend working on the project indefinitely due to: getting a new job and still attending summer school. The only thing that I accomplished to make is a tech demo featuring some of the character art that I created after working on it for around a week. The pitch in it's entirety and a demo download link can be found below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bf/2bf477c3d9c47fcd58866b6b464bb215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoachDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
