Since it is a map pack, many developers were involved with ID Software releasing the maps to the public.</p>\n<p>The expansion pack features 21 maps (the 21st one is a secret map) with some of the maps offering their own story.</p>\n<h3>Story maps</h3>\n<p>Titan.wad<br />\nThere is a secret science building on Titan, which contains a mighty alien weapon. Get in, kill the guards, solve puzzles, get out.</p>\n<p>Cabal.wad<br />\nOnce upon a time, you were the biggest and the angriest cyberdemon in existence. You were the head of the council that ruled Hell, at least you were before you were betrayed. Go out there and get revenge.</p>\n<p>Inferno.wad<br />\nAfter all the trouble you&#39;ve gone through at the UAC facility, you&#39;ve lost track of your girlfriend Beatrice. It&#39;s no mystery how you got separated with all the demons running around. Go back to Hell and get her out.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This expansion pack brought no changes to Doom II&#39;s gameplay. Every aspect of the game stayed largely the same.</p>\n<p>The main objective of Doom 2 is to find an exit off the level to continue to the next one, killing any demon you find on your way. Many weapons are at your disposal, such as a shotgun, a double-barrelled super-shotgun, and last, but not least, the iconic chainsaw. </p>\n<p>There is no health regen in the game. Instead, the players have to look for medkits on the level they are in at the moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-10T21:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8ad3beca3f31d3d5033b6442ae4713a.jpg", "website": "https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 92, "owned": 1671, "beaten": 57, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 23, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 112, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 112, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Classic Macintosh"], "developers": ["id Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "id Software", "GT Interactive Software", "GT Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
