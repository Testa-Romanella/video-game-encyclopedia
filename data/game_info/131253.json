Go as fast as you can, but if you move in the red light, you die! Patience is key.</p><p>The light-letting windows are randomly generated each time, so this game has <strong>replay value</strong>. ;)<br/></p><p>(No audio)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dbdf8f9730219daf8af3dd2ee24ed3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Colin Amos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
