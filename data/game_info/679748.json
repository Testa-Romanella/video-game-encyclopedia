A Spacecar?!??!!</p>\n<p>Welcome to Spacecar! It's a space car!!\u00a0Watch\u00a0it\u00a0hover!!!\u00a0Woah!</p>\n<p>Have a slip and glide over the air as you drift to some spacey music. Then realize that floating cars are very hard to control. Then then, learn how to wrangle the thing to go where you want!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space bar - Forward thrust<br/>A/D/Arrow keys - Turn<br/>R - Respawn at last checkpoint<br/>Escape - Exit the game</p>\n<p>Everything apart from textures and meshes created by me using Unreal engine 4.26.2 and Ableton. Textures and meshes are part of Unreal's starter assets.</p><p>Note: For each track you need to complete 3 laps (resetting the car doesn't reset the lap count don't worry). I may add some UI like a lap counter &amp; timer at some point if enough ppl want it but it's not a priority atm.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T09:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/103/10310a619292b7bcd55dc5851ee15b25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnoopyG"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
