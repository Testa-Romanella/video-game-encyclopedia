Jump over obstacles not far from them to get points if you don't want to start the game again.<br/>\r\nIn this game you have to hold the ball as far as possible by jumping over the fences. If you are close enough to them, the points at the top of the screen will increase. The speed of the ball increases as you move across the field, so the task of jumping over the next obstacle may be more difficult.<br/>\r\nWhen touched with a fence, the player starts the game from the starting position, with a score of 0 and the base speed.<br/>\r\nScore as many points as possible.<br/>\r\nGood luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f44d9b92ad0abcd1f9e24523af5a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pijunuj"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Pijunuj"], "esrb_rating": null}
