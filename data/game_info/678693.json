{"id": 678693, "slug": "decision-red-daze", "name": "Decision: Red Daze", "name_original": "Decision: Red Daze", "description": "Decision: Red Daze is an isometric action RPG with a unique spin on survival and tower defense mechanics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dust Bowl, once a \u2018thriving\u2019 society of corrupt politicians, rich property barons and everyday people who work for them \u2018100% willingly\u2019, has been overtaken by a mysterious phenomenon only known by survivors as the Red Daze. As the illness takes hold of the survivors and turns them into crazed and EXTREMELY dangerous mutated creatures, the worlds\u2019 governments are running around like headless chickens. It falls to the few who remain to fend off the monsters in hopes of finding a way to eradicate the Red Daze once and for all.<h3>PLAY AS ANYONE</h3><br/>Even the lowliest survivor you find has the potential to lead his own squad, explore, make the wasteland safe, and shape their own destiny. It\u2019s up to you to upgrade and specialize any survivor you find in the wasteland any way you see fit.<br/><br/><h3>EXPLORE, LOOT AND CAPTURE</h3><br/>While most of the buildings of the Dust Bowl are long abandoned and taken over by the undead, the loot and potential shelter is coveted by most survivors. During your exploration missions you\u2019ll come across various farmsteads, factories and military installations full to the brim with monsters, loot, and most importantly, foundations that hold the potential to turn the long abandoned structures into sprawling and heavily fortified settlements.<br/><br/><h3>YOUR OWN SAFE HAVEN</h3><br/>With survivors from all over the wasteland pouring into your settlements for safety, it\u2019s smart to keep them occupied. Assign them to build factories to make food, fabricate resources or make useful goods to barter with, put up and upgrade defenses, and in the event of an attack, task your best soldiers to protect your settlements while you\u2019re away or join the battle yourself and help push back the monsters coming to take what\u2019s yours!<br/><br/><h3>SCOUT OUT YOUR COMPETITION</h3><br/>The packs of monsters always have a leader. Plan ahead, strategically assemble your squad of specialists to maximize your odds of survival, and head out on exploration and scouting missions. Gather vital intelligence on the monsters\u2019 movements to better defend your settlements, or find and eliminate the bosses to stop the attacks altogether.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-06T10:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/1006d31496cc6edee58609477d96edc9.jpg", "website": "https://www.nordcurrent.com/games/decision-red-daze", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 497, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlyAnvil"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nordcurrent", "Nordcurrent Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
