I hope the project source code will be helpful to you.<br/>\r\n There is one thing I would like to ask you, though: it is OK for me if \r\nyou make a commercial game out of it but please do not distribute (or \r\nsell) the project source code (including art and audio), as doing so \r\nwould invalidate the experiment mentioned above (and violate the \r\nlicense).\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t If possible, redirect interested people to where you got the project source code. This is much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t In other words, by getting the project source code, you agree that:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>You can release commercial and non-commercial games using the project source code;</li>\n<li>You cannot and will not distribute or sell the project source code, including the art and audio files included with it.</li>\n</ul><strong>Contact/Support</strong><p>\r\n\tHaving trouble with the game?
