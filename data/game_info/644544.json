We can use the themes however we want to build something special.</p>\n<p>We decided to make a game around the themes of <strong>isolation</strong>, t<strong>rapped in a different world</strong> and <strong>adventure </strong>since we better resonate with those.</p>\n<p>The game will be about a character who got himself trapped in a hospital in a different dimension where the doctors are freaky monsters who will do anything to kill him. The character has to find a way to exit the hospital without getting killed.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Storyline</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>John is a young teacher with a cartesian mind : he doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, witches, sorcery\u2026 He lives with his wife and his kids. His wife is a nurse in an old hospital where he goes sometimes to meet his dentist for some teeth care. But the building is commonly known for its dark past because this place used to be an asylum where people were tortured and killed by the doctors working here. Sometimes people reported seeing some ghosts or moving objects in the building when the weather was rainy. There have also been some weird disappearances where no body was found.</p>\n<p>On a cold and rainy day, John decided to go to this hospital to see his doctor although his wife specifically told him not to because she was afraid of the rumours around the hospital on rainy days. In fact, John had an affair with his dentist and he uses those appointments to meet her in secret. His wife forced him at least to take an amulet to protect him while he was out. John took it only to make his wife shut up and be able to go meet his dentist. Unfortunately, while on the road, John gets hit by a car and loses consciousness. He wakes up later in a bed at the hospital, alone with some bruises and headache. He tries to call for someone but nobody answers. He feels like something is definitely wrong with the environment and he felt some chills going all the way in his spine.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Made by</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Albokhari Mohamed (graphics)</li><li>The Master (code)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T08:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a88792cd0b26d701fe9265f946334f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jubileus Deus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
