The game features typical FPS attributes: covers, vehicles and much shooting. <br />\nAs the player proceeds through the trilogy&#39;s storyline, they encounter a decades-long conflict between the Helghast and Vekta. Let alone two planets, both Helghan and Vekta are dwelled by humans after the Earth became uninhabitable. Killzone 2 explores a superplanet conflict through the eyes of Vekatn officer named Tomas &quot;Sev&quot; Sevchenko who is eager to find out the reasons conflict have burned up. <br />\nOne of the main attraction of a gameplay part is multiplayer \u2014 the first installment has not starred it. Online game reminisces the main story: the players play a role of either ISA or Helghast commander trying to defeat the opposing team. There are a total of 14 maps (8 being distributed on disc and 6 via DLC), 15 weapons and 7 classes in total.</p>", "metacritic": 91, "released": "2009-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T21:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9d8/9d88739254a63a59352f3c27a9c5d694.jpg", "website": "http://www.killzone.com", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 562, "beaten": 217, "toplay": 52, "dropped": 38, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 183, "suggestions_count": 684, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 186, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Guerrilla Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
