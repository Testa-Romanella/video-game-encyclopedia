I really hoped to get more done, but I guess for a first time this isn't too bad! I'll definitely keep working on game development!</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for playing my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:33:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/728/728500592e16ccbbafb5083ce9b9bad1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Angaros"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
