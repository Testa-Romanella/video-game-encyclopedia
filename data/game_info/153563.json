Mr. Whiskers loves all types of food, but when the maker of his favourite dumplings goes missing, leaving a trail that winds towards the biggest mountain in the valley, our pudgy feline hero has no choice but to acquire a taste for adventure. The Big Journey is a rolly-poly physics-based adventure where players rotate the screen to roll Mr. Whiskers safely through danger, puzzles, and other challenges. Sporting simple but addictive gameplay, crisp storybook visuals, and a toe-tapping original soundtrack, The Big Journey is great for all ages and skill levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08f/08fc10173d395a62863527be5d3dd143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Catfishbox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
