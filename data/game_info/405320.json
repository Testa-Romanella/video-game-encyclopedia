You're tasked with stocking the produce department with fresh fruits and veggies to pass the time until your shift is over. Welcome to Parker's!</p><p>The build from Otronicon is now available. Use a controller to play. Use the left stick to move. Press A when close to a box to pick it up. Press A when a box is in your hands to put the box down. Press B to put items on a shelf when you're holding the correct box for the items on that shelf. You can also press B to talk to customer's and coworkers.\u00a0</p><p>The game is still in a very early state, so it's very buggy.\u00a0If you use a keyboard, you can press R to reset the scene. You can also use WASD to walk, Q to pick up/put down, and E\u00a0to interact (like B on a controller.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2ec18b3c882abafc73913155f32685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parker's Grocery"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
