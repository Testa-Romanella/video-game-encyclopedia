It touches topics that hit close to home for me. Read the warnings and decide if you want to delve into this. Also, while this is not a straight up horror game, I really don't plan it to be, I still wanted to label it as such because of the topics explored, of torture, death, suicide, depression, anxiety, PTSD, sadly rape, murder, war, mafia, and apocalypse.\r\n</p>\n<p>I'm going to try to have humorous moments, because I don't want to be all down. Yeah, there are dark topics, but there's stuff that I listed that I refuse to depict visually, nor even describe in text. Yes, Scortalo went through horrible stuff, but even I have a pretty big limit of comfort describing it. Like, it's mentioned in the game, but I will not describe it or show it in the game, if that makes sense. At least the really, really disturbing stuff.\r\n</p>\n<p>You know how art can help the artist cope with their life. Yeah, this is what this is for me.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b106a0ac2345924f19edc78d0ccc76ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafe LaNore"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
