He gave the laptop to me because he is moving to the USA for college. I assume he made this because he had some interest in coding. Idk what genre to pick so no genre will do. I have no idea who the picture is but it was also in the same folder I found the game in. There are both windows and mac versions but this game was probably made on a mac because it was on his macbook. It is fullscreen so make sure you know how to force quit before playing.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:25:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["flsaskca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
