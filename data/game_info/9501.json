We have worked extensively with third party developers to make sure the two products can work alongside each other, however due to the wide range of add-on products available for MSFSX, we cannot guarantee that your existing content will work with Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam Edition.<br/><br/>The Flight Simulator X Software Development Kit (SDK) is not included with FSX: Steam Edition.<br/><br/>If you already have MSFSX installed on your PC and are concerned about running the two games alongside each other, you may wish to consider installing FSX: Steam Edition on a separate PC. <br/><br/>If you already have MSFSX and add-ons installed they will only be accessible through your existing installation. They will not be duplicated across the original edition and Steam Edition of the simulator.Included Aircraft<ul><li>Augusta Westland EH101 (Helicopter)<br/></li><li>Airbus A321<br/></li><li>AirCreation 582L Trike Ultralight<br/></li><li>Beechcraft Baron 58<br/></li><li>Beechcraft King Air 350<br/></li><li>Bell 206B JetRanger (Helicopter)<br/></li><li>Boeing 737-800<br/></li><li>Boeing 747-400<br/></li><li>Boeing F/A-18<br/></li><li>Bombardier CRJ700<br/></li><li>Bombardier LearJet 45<br/></li><li>Cessna C172SP Skyhawk<br/></li><li>Cessna C208B Grand Caravan<br/></li><li>De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver<br/></li><li>DG Flugzeugbau DG-808S<br/></li><li>Douglas DC3<br/></li><li>Extra 300S<br/></li><li>Gumman G21A Goose <br/></li><li>Maule M7 Orion<br/></li><li>Maule M7 Orion (on skis)<br/></li><li>Mooney Bravo<br/></li><li>North American P-51D Mustang<br/></li><li>Piper J-3 Cub<br/></li><li>Robinson R22 Beta II (Helicopter)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca74e02f14213eea7b0b10f1bff95d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.fsxinsider.com", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 585, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 29, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Microsoft Game Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Dovetail Games - Flight"], "esrb_rating": null}
