The theme for this year was out of control, in which the speed of the car is out of control and your car does flips randomly. I made this game using Unity and Audacity to edit any sound effects. Any sources that I used during the process of making this game, are linked at the end of the game. This is the second game that I finished and my first time submitting a game into a game jam. Thank you for playing my game, I hoped you enjoyed and had fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/2490fe96914a31b5e058d137d428fbac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlamingFast"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
