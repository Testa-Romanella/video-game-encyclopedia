You don't have to donate to me at all. I'm just having fun doing this. A majority of the assets are not mine, but as far as characters go, I am going to go through little by little and replace them with my own art. This game is your basic fantasy story that is a basically a playable copy of a Roleplay story that I am making with one of my lovely friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1bb9713de80f8bbc1a31dad5807fc58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeathOnSet"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
