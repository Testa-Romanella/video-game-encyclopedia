The goal of the game is to take the best photos by placing your photo frame on the board where it frames the fish that give you the most points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before each round, reveal 3 new objective cards and add a Transparent Fish Mat to the board. Each Mat can be rotated or flipped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as the Fish Mat is placed, the round begins! In real time, scan the board and place your Photo Frame anywhere on the board. Players can\u2019t overlap, so quickly snap the best shot you can find! Once you place your frame, you can't move it. When only one player has yet to place their frame, the group counts down from 5. The last player must place their frame before the countdown reaches 0.</p>\n<p>Once everyone has placed their frame, each player collects Starfish for completing objectives. After 3 rounds, the player with the most Starfish wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c306c02e8b8e77c195e0a66632a92da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeffwchin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
