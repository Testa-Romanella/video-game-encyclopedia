This Is The Police is a short story - a game using text. For an unknown reason the world has been attacked by zombies, and as an officier working in the emergency center, you have to help a nurse in a hospital so as to save her life. In this game, there is a kind of inventory system. <strong>You start with nothing</strong>, but you have to collect items or information so as to progress in game. I use a dialog system so as to create this story, some UI features - and black humor :)</p>\n\n<p>Escape to close application</p>\n<p>R to restart game when she is dead<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T08:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c69435254bdedfa9dc8646a5a0f76bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
