That's right! The route that's usually the easiest to complete is no longer available.\u00a0\r\nYou (Geum Park) are thrust into the world of a reverse harem, where your precious childhood friend (Emily Carter) is being hit on by two of your classmates (Ao Yazawa and Hong Yang Chan). You can choose to either play the role of a love interest and try to win the heroine's heart, or... you can play your own game and try to make the two boys fall for you instead!
