Few of us remained to see what is known today as the \"Duckpocalypse\". As an enraged simple human mind, you manage to build two guns with the scrap you gathered from an annoying robot duck, and so this is how your duck hunt starts!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuckpocalypse is a VR arcade-style game made for the HTC Vive. Get in, grab your guns, take a second to let the new pixel world around you sink in, and then shoot that start button! Get on a fast paced challenge to bring down as many of those robot ducks as you can! Invite your friends over and see who can set the best score!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor reviewers and letsplayers:<br/>\r\nAll content was developed by us, but we have no problem with you playing this game and it's content on your videos and reviews, so feel free to play this game in your channel, including images, sounds and music, but please be fair and place a link to this game or our company somewhere in your description.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/737e319e3f7d5f609c0ddec8fc6374f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 21}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Capitola VR"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Capitola VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
