Lots of systems are going to be in place and there is going to be tons of things to do. This is what I'm mainly going to be working on and will be frequently updating this itch.io every time I add significant content. I am learning by the day and even if nobody cares about it I seek to make a game that I will have fun playing and have countless ideas for the future if I can get the systems set up correctly.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>1 - 9\u00a0 Hotbar Selection\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0E\u00a0 Use\u00a0(Bugged Use Sparingly)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Space\u00a0 \u00a0Attack\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Click\u00a0 \u00a0Place Block\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Escape\u00a0 \u00a0Pause</p>\n<p>*THE INVENTORY SYSTEM IS A BIT BUGGED RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS THE PLACE DESTROY SYSTEM NOT BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED (YES I KNOW ABOUT THE WATER)</p>\n<p>Version 0.1 for the Jam doesn't really include the theme in any way I used the jam to get lots of work done in short time // lots more will be added later and tons will be fixed so come back and check on my progress once in a while as I slowly figure out how to develop everything solo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf83c9f150e408a87507574ffdd355d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["horsewane"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
