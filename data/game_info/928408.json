An untold horror haunts these lonely trails, stalking your every move. Each ascending step brings you closer to your goal and even closer to death. And die you shall, more than once, in your quest to explore further, hide more effectively and slide to safety only when necessary.<br/></p>\n<p>ALPEN GHOUL is an exploration/stealth game. Your goal is to reach the summit alive, but you are not alone. You are being hunted by a creature freely roaming the map using non-linear paths. Moving too quickly and making too much noise assures a quick and brutal end to your journey at the hands of your pursuer, so play smart and move with purpose. A flashlight will help light your way, but will also light the way to <em>you</em>, so use it with caution.</p>\n<p>When the creature finds you, and it <em>will</em> find you, escape may still be possible by way of <strong>sliding </strong>down the treacherous mountainside: the only way to move faster than the creature in the game. The price of a speedy descent is high, however, since you won\u2019t just leave behind the creature\u2026 but some of your progress as well. Choose wisely.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Multiple routes through varying terrain present different difficulty levels, with trees serving as a general guide toward a less dangerous path. An appetite for danger <em>does</em> come with rewards though, as more difficult areas may hide <strong>Secret Tapes</strong> that can be played in <strong>Safe Rooms</strong> scattered throughout the map. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Safe Rooms</strong> serve as your only respite from the hunt, stopping the clock and resetting the creature\u2019s intensity to \u201ccalm\u201d, so keep your eyes peeled for these hidden locations. You\u2019ll need them.</p>\n\n<p>The creature is fast, intelligent and grows evermore agitated by your continued survival. It\u2019s up to you to learn from your mistakes and reach the summit in one piece.<br/></p>\r\nDo you have what it takes to reach the top?\r\n<br/>\n<p>Donate\u00a0to help support future development on ALPEN GHOUL.\u00a0 This is our first game so feedback is welcomed and will help shape the final product.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can reach us at brocboisgames@gmail.com</p>\n<p>-- TIPS FROM THE DEV --</p>\n<p>It can hear your footsteps and see the flashlight.\u00a0 Use the left mouse button to toggle the light on and off. Running is the loudest action you can perform.\u00a0 In ALPEN GHOUL, prolonged running is generally bad for your health.\u00a0 Crawling is nearly silent.</p>\n<p>You need a bit of speed in order to start sliding. All you need is a bit of speed to start sliding, which means you can also slide on flat land. You move slower when moving uphill and will not have enough speed to slide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to balance gaining ground up the mountain and sliding to get away.\u00a0 The further you make it up the mountain the further you can slide to safety if things take a turn for the worse.</p>\n<p>Orange flags represent the most balanced route.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in the large cave complex, you're probably not going to survive much longer.\u00a0 The outdoor routes are generally easier.</p>\n<p>Press \"E\" on the selected tape to\u00a0switch tapes in the boombox once you find a new tape.<br/></p>\n<p>Tapes you acquire carry over into New Game +, so make sure to check out one of the safe rooms after beating the game.\u00a0 Playing New Game + gives you the HARD MODE tape ( don't worry, it's not on by default ).\u00a0 If you value your life, don't\u00a0leave it playing in the boombox when you leave the safe room. Beating HARD MODE will require knowledge of the entire map, how it interlocks, and what short cuts can be used to your advantage.</p>\n<p>The game is hard by design,\u00a0but I believe in you.\u00a0 Think of it as a tug-of-war.\u00a0 You want to make it to the top, but the creature keeps pulling you back down.\u00a0 Take your time and\u00a0watch its movements.\u00a0 Get a feel for the environment.\u00a0 Chill out in the safe room and collect your thoughts. With a little creativity, you may even be able to use your knowledge of the environment to your advantage.\u00a0 It's going to be hard for everyone at first, but by the end, it will be YOUR mountain.</p>\n\n<p>The video below has more tips on how to play, but contains gameplay spoilers for one of the tapes you can find on the mountain.</p>\n<p>Good luck<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T22:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a105980d262d8ed1599c92e25e905eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrocBois"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
