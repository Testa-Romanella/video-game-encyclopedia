It is essentially finished, (though not too thoroughly tested). It\u2019s a kind of escape room game, but there\u2019s no UI so you just have to fend for yourself, which can make escaping the rooms a little surreal, and the mouse controller needs some adjustment, I have an idea to some time in the future use a game like this (or extension of this game) to showcase current artists\u2019 work within an escape room context.
