At first they will be stronger and you will most likely die, but worry not! As you collect Lust Essence, newer generations will get stronger!</p>\n<p>Current state: this is a game being made for the Finally Finish Something 2019 jam and is still a very early build. Only basic actions in battle and no animations. The game will be considered finished when all systems are working properly and the Fighter girl battle\u00a0is complete as well (has all art content needed). After that I will keep working on the game to add extra girls to battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4affa012c867538ac0270f3d7ffe78c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BBSoft"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
