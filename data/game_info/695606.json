The player is not directly involved in the policing. Rather, at the beginning of each day the player is simply given additional information by their boss which impacts what has previously been linked and what will be linked during that workday. For example, the player may have the case seemingly solved, with the culprit being Carl, but then the boss says \u201cCarl is no longer a suspect.\u201d The boss doesn\u2019t give you any reason why Carl is no longer a suspect. This new information causes the player to re-link, and re-think. But also it adds to the meta narrative that something bigger is going on. Why are you kept in the dark? Why are these alleged criminals being let go?\r\n</li><li>First day on the job. Not told why the previous person left, even though you ask (why the secrecy?). Maybe they find a note on their desk from the previous person: \"Don't trust your boss.\" In this case, why does the boss allow your role to even exist? Is it a requirement somehow, which would then breed resentment?\r\n</li><li>Additional evidence types including \u201cwhispers,\u201d unofficial evidence that the player captures from speech bubbles from passersby as the player walks home each night.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Bleeping Demo by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/7012-bleeping-demo<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T09:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f9/2f94b67f0abe918e5e5f8ffb8872a07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["calebjross"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
