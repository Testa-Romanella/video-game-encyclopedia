Once an item is collected, another will not be spawned until the holding player is defeated. Defeat players though melee attacks, powerups found around the playground, or by pushing them off the edge, but watch out - respawns are turned off while a player holds all four items. The player with all four items\u00a0must successfully defeat all other players in order to win.</p>\n<p>Controls (Xbox gamepad / Switch Joycon (sideways)):</p>\n<p>Left Stick / Stick\u00a0- Move</p>\n<p>LT / SL - Run</p>\n<p>A / A or down - Jump</p>\n<p>X / B\u00a0 or left - Bite</p>\n<p>B / X or right - Powerup</p>\n<p>Back - Restart</p>\n<p>Start - Join</p>\n<p>This game is a prototype made over about a month in small teams for the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts and Engineering Capstone program.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e6521e9ba4f8dd3e4006a6f939c5f439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MJ", "claude", "Aidan Buckner"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
