Enough is enough. It&#39;s time to venture through the woods, conquer the fortress, and delve into the heart of the dragon&#39;s lair to take back what&#39;s yours and teach those dragons a lesson.<br />\nPeglin plays like a combination of Peggle and Slay the Spire. The enemies are tough, and if you&#39;re defeated your run is over, but you&#39;ve got powerful orbs with special effects and incredible relics that influence both your enemies and the physics you&#39;ll use to defeat them.Features:<br />\nCollect and upgrade powerful orbs and relics to defeat the monsters and bosses that stand in your way.<br />\nFight enemies with Pachinko-like gameplay - hit more pegs to do more damage. Use crit potions, refresh potions, and bombs wisely.<br />\nExplore a new forest every time, with different orbs, enemies, and surprises along the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T09:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fef/fefab2bfbb9e684eafabd1088d7e6908.jpg", "website": "https://rednexus.games/", "rating": 3.69, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 154, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Red Nexus Games", "Lucas Cardoso", "Blumstengel", "Gedig"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieArk", "Red Nexus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
