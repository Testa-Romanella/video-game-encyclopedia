The levels would also probably be better for speedruns and stuff if the red zone's didn't spawn randomly. Perhaps powerups and merging cubes and stuff too, feel free to give me some suggestions :)<br/></p><p>This was made in a weekend for the Ludum Dare 37 game jam.</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&amp;uid=38972<br/></p><p>For now though there are only four levels, I forgot ludum dare was on until Saturday night so I was in a bit of a rush to get it all finished!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/850361a4fd6535ffdaef0f810f76b296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TomMarsland"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
