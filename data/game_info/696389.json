You reach the end, pull the switch and that's it.</p>\n<p>But, was that really the end? Surely, after the events you've went through, it sure seems the orchestra is over.</p>\n<p>A repeat has started, and you're the star of the show once more.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Encore. A fangame that reboots the events of OFF to ensure that this world can continue existing.\u00a0Your role as a puppeteer hasn't changed, but your puppet has.\u00a0You play as the Melodist. An entity brought into this retold tale with the sole purpose of restoring order and harmony back to it. Your task is simple, help the Melodist fulfill her goal. Make sure her mission is accomplished and, above all,\u00a0always try to stay on the\u00a0planned path.</p>\n<p>What's the planned path, you might ask? That's up to you to decide which one is more suitable.</p>\n<p>Your journey will lead you to many familiar places and let you meet some new and old\u00a0faces too.</p>\n<p>This game is, as of right now, on it's first ever demo. It starts with zone 0 and goes all the way to the end of zone 1. It is also set to have multiple endings based on the choice you make at the end of each zone.</p>\n<p>This is just a little side project of mine that I've kept in the back for a long time (and also my first attempt at telling an actual narrative, so things <em>might </em>change down the line, but we'll see), but I figured I might as well share what I've got with whoever is interested in some OFF spinoffs.</p>\n<p>More coming soon (in other words,\u00a0when I feel like it lol).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T07:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f32/f3290ce93050f2c76aad18455be9b1f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yusonin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
