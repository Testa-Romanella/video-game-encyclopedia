Outbreak: Epidemic, Outbreak: The New Nightmare and Outbreak allow you to play their entire Campaigns, Onslaught Modes and Experiments Modes with a friend in vertical or horizontal splitscreen. Select your survivor, scrounge for supplies, solve puzzles, battle the undead and don't forget to watch each others backs!<br/><br/>The infection goes nation-wide in Outbreak: Epidemic, an action-focused co-op survival horror adventure. Featuring the great Outbreak series gameplay with greater mobility, crushing difficulty and more camera options than ever before. Alone or in 2-player local co-op, fight through the Campaign story mode, the wave-based Onslaught Mode and all new Experiments Mode scenarios. Choose your survivor, class and level up to unlock new buffs for your survivor as you face the nightmare. You'll need to manage your inventory and supplies carefully, so make every bullet count!<br/><br/>In Outbreak: The New Nightmare, enter an unforgiving co-op survival horror experience as you fight for your life against oppressive odds. The horrors of Arzt Memorial Hospital were just the beginning of the outbreak. As the infection spread across the city, local law enforcement fell quickly. You now find yourself trapped in a hellscape with only a few remaining survivors. Scavenge the environment for supplies, face off against the undead and do anything it takes to survive. Play the entire game either alone or in local splitscreen co-op. You only have one life. Make it count!<br/><br/>Explore a nightmarish environment, scrounge for supplies, and battle the undead in Outbreak -- a retro 2D hardcore survival horror game. The clock never stops as you attempt to manage an extremely limited inventory with a murderous horde on the hunt. Choose between acquiring additional weapons, healing items, or necessary tools for progression. Play through the Campaign and Onslaught Modes alone or with a friend in local co-op, including the option for AI teammates. Also experience small survivor horror vignettes in the Nightmares mode.
