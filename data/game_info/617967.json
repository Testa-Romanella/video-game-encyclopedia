Some will kill  multiple humans while others may die instantly upon impact, be sure to  plan strategically of where you place these units, as you have a limited  resource.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Left click on your pylon units to move them, when you left click on  your miner units, you can have them mine with the mine command. These  miners will mine anything within proximity, which you can see by  hovering over them with your mouse. You will need to move your pylon  units so your miners can have access to the crystal resources, and  construct pylon chains to move these units forward.\r\n    </p>\n<p>When you left click on a tile, you can create fighter bots, miners,  or more pylon units. You will need a pylon unit within range to make  fighter bots or miners as these need to be connected to your main hub.\r\n    </p>\n<p><em><strong>Game Design/Programming:</strong></em> Ben, Mark, T\u00f9ng\r\n    </p>\n<p><em><strong>Main Tile and Unit Assets:</strong></em> Ben\r\n    </p>\n<p><em><strong>Music and Sound Effects:</strong></em> Alex\r\n    </p>\n<p><em><strong>Additional assets, design and animations:</strong> </em>Nik\r\n    </p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6efb07f64c654f6f6afed4f629b8d13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["botmark", "Bobo_Baqa", "SADragonMaker", "nashdashin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
