He has to get some oxygen tubes for his astronaut friend. However the astronaut has monster pets that very easily can be killed. Mr. Spikes has to be very careful so he doesn't accidently kill any monsters.</p>\n\n<p>Sound effects and music are not made by me</p>\n<p>Sound effects from: Bfxr and Freesound.org</p>\n<p>Music from: OpenGameArt.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5c/b5c4bdd7ec4aa7fc1a79404e04ae222d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GMAnte"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
