Use your traps cleverly to expel the suitors/knights. <br/><br/>--------- <br/><br/>Only use right and left arrows to move and space for the rest. Each lever activates a different trap (which needs to reload). Once the night has come and all the knights are expelled, you can either upgrade one of your traps or repair your door. <br/><br/>If the knights break your door, the game is over. <br/><br/>The game has no end, you just have to resist as long as possible. <br/><br/>--------- <br/><br/>It was made for Ludum Dare 37 (theme \"one room\") in roughly 2 days: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&amp;uid=66030<br/><br/>--------- <br/><br/>Twitter: @messire_Cookie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a1a1909279c452ef97784246022200c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David \"Cookie\" Fonteix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
