Hexed of his vitality, he must escape the castle before his time expires. Face to face with the husks of former adventurers and the witch's own experiments, he must prevail. Fear not, as many previous adventures have left white chysanthemums in their wake- a powerful flower that restores meager portions of his life force so he may push further into the dungeon and delay the inevitable. After all, Mardona always gets her way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T19:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/457/457e2dc8609ac11736d8cd262dc9f917.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prismapunch"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
