Learning the fundamentals and basics of Unity, the initial prototype includes a character who can run and explore a randomly generated forest. As I continue growing my skills, I aim to take these foundational skills to create an interactive world that serves as a portfolio of my work. The goal is to expand from this initial prototype into creating new worlds and environments that reflect certain projects I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019m excited to continue expanding on this project and creating a new way of interacting with portfolios. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad539a344700d789558677784c68134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["omikoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
