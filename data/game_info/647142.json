This is my first developed mini-game I've made using SFML.</p>\r\nANY FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED!\r\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY?\r\n<p>The game is very similar to flappy bird, simply tap or click the screen to fly and avoid the pillars which is standing in your way, and once you passed the pillars, you gain score points. The more score you've gain, the greater you are as a player. Ride your rocket, to aim to the highest!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Fly</p>\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nA game and featuring design, art, and code by Jerico, also known as OwllCraft\r\nContributors:\r\n<p>Thanks to Swagshaw, and Whyx for beta testing the game.</p>\n\r\nSOCIAL MEDIAS:\r\n<p><strong>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/OwllCraft</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've presented the game to her birthday since August 6. and she really loves it so far. She really likes the colors of the sprites because it matches to her favorite color. She tried to play it and scored 10 as her highest score. She wanted me to publish it as a mobile game, but sadly I'm not at that level yet and I still need much to learn. So far, I'm glad she loves it!</p>\r\nHappy Birthday Mom!\r\n\n<p><strong>original itch release</strong>: August 7, 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/699a95c0be44278a1909bfaef6495611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OwllCraft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
