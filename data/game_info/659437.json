I didn't had enough time to finish it.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Techincally the game is suppose to be played by 1 player and 3 ai. Each x second player and AI would rotate what army they are playing. The goal is to send smaller boat to attack the main boat and destroy it of the opennent. <br/><br/>The catch? If you destroy an opponent and in the next rotation land on his army. You loose. Meaning, you have to play slowly and calculate before attempting to destroy one of the main boat and looks into what order to proceed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:46:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d16df903518559ae9b08178714d26185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kyshama"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
