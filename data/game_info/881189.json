This game contains <strong>all levels from circloO and circloO 2</strong>, plus <strong>twelve brand-new bonus levels </strong>and a <strong>level editor</strong>! You can also play levels uploaded by other players from the editor!<br/><br/>You're a small ball rolling around in a round level. Collect circles to grow the level circle. As it grows, everything stays in the level, so you'll have to avoid and use obstacles in everchanging ways. For example, a platform that was first very useful to gain height, may prove to be a challenging obstacle after the level has grown!<br/><br/>You can only move left and right, so you'll want to use features of the level carefully to jump and gain height. You'll discover all sorts of physics features, such as changing gravity, a sea of tiny blocks, strange contraptions and even planets with a gravity field. In challenging parts, you'll find yourself fully immersed, pressing your arrow keys as hard as you can trying to get closer to finally collecting that next circle. But don't worry: you'll never have to start over a level, so you can always try again really quickly! And I can guarantee you'll feel amazing once you finally manage it!<br/><br/>With millions of plays on other platforms, circloO has been enjoyed by many and I hope you'll enjoy it too! Have fun and I'm happy to hear what you think!<br/><br/><br/><br/>circloO Complete features:<br/>- Lots of cool physics features: ropes, pulleys, changing gravity and much more! I've included quite a few mechanics for you to discover!<br/>- 56 fun, growing, ever more challenging levels! Can you complete the six almost-but-not-quite-impossible Hard Mode levels?<br/>- All levels from circloO 2 and the original circloO, plus twelve brand-new levels!<br/>- Unique physics puzzles in each level.<br/>- Great music and sound effects by Stijn Cappetijn.<br/>- The game will take most players two to three hours to complete. Level times are saved, so you can try to beat your own highscores and speedrun levels after that!<br/>- Create your own levels in the level editor!
