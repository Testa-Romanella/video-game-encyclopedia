And the answer is: absolutely.<br/><br/>See, Monologue is not just about words. Words are a big part of the game, sure, but there are also numbers. Those are important too. Every time you spell words you get numbers, and then, if you get enough numbers, the game rewards you with animations and sound effects. But in order to get big enough numbers, you need to plan ahead. You need to use the strategies.<br/><br/>I assume that that explanation was very clear.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Monologue has an interactive tutorial that explains the game and its mechanics much better than this description will. And if you buy the game, you can go through the tutorial. In fact, it\u2019s probably the best thing you could do in order to decide if you want to buy the game or not.
