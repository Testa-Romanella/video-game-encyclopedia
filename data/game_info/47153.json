Train Simulator PRO 2018 will let you drive carefully modeled locomotives leading passenger or freight trains across the eastern half of the US. Whether you like fast passenger locomotives or powerful freight movers able to pull dozens of cars, in our game you will find it all. Whatever you choose, you will have to watch out for speed limits, rail crossings, signals and other trains. Plan your route wisely to maximize profits and create the most powerful railway company in the US!<br/><br/>During your travels, you can admire photo-realistic graphics including cities, suburbs, factories, countrysides and much more.
