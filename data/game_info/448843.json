I guess people that repair controllers for a living could get some use out of something like this.</p>\n<ul><li>Press \"F1\" or \"I\" for the sticks and triggers exact input measurements, along with a bit more info on your connected gamepads.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Press \"G\" to switch for a green background to use with chroma key in greenscreen for input overlay on streams, this will also disappear the small icons on the bottom so only the chosen controller is visible.</li></ul>\n<p>It will detect Xbox, PS4 and generic XInput and DirectInput controllers without installing any software that wraps your inputs (like DS4Windows) and makes them pass as an Xbox gamepad. You can also switch between Xbox and DS4 button layouts by clicking on their respective icons. <br/></p>\n<p>This could also double as a button press display for speedrunners along with OBS for streaming purposes, if you wanted to.</p>\n<p>I currently do not have money to afford any other controllers, but if donations came through, I could buy some more and get this working for Switch and other console gamepads as well. I could also afford the license for HTML5 exporting and could have controller testing online with HTML5.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c68/c6848d4d7c66bd0e4af0376be9ad4dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Killerkun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
