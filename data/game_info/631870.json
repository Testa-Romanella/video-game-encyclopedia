Sounds simple, right? Each level has\u00a0goals like Required Score,\u00a0Required WPM, and Required Type Streaks that you must accomplish to win.\u00a0Try to unlock all 8 levels in progression mode or see how long you can type in Survival mode. There are 3 difficulty settings for each level that increase speed and time limits. Can you ascend to the top and beat all 8 levels on 3-star difficulty?\u00a0</p>\n<p>FEEDBACK / INFO\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am greatly interested in any feedback regarding this game. This game can be played by novice and expert typers alike. Feel free to comment on game balancing details (Level Goals, Progression, Word Speed, etc.) that you think could be improved. I\u00a0am also curious if anyone can beat level 8 on the highest difficulty ... because I cannot.\u00a0 :)</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Credits / Attribution are accessible from the in-game main menu.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:57:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92aed3da82c70adcdbb0cb06e7c651ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jb14"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
