One of them is totally not a chicken.</li><li>Puzzles and comedy following in the footsteps of the good ol' point-and-click adventure games from LucasArts and Sierra.</li><li>Fully voice acted with more than 150 original voice lines! (Or semi-fully anyway. We misplaced some of our sound bites. Sorry!!)</li><li>Tons of replayability with complex dialogue options and characters. Solving puzzles has never been this much fun!
