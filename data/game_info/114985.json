The problem came when not a single robot came back out. You are a\r\nspecial robot as you are armed with a fire balls gun, and your goal is to do a\r\nrecon trip over those caves and mines. You are also armed with a light, so the\r\nrecon video will show perfectly. Everything started to be a mess when some\r\nstrange creature closed and locked the only way out. You got disconnected, but you\r\nwoke up with an emergency battery. Let's go find the key of the door, set on\r\nfire as many trolls as you encounter, and be free. LEAP OUT OF THE CAVE!</p><p>AUTHORS: Jennifer Garc\u00eda de la Calle, Sergio del Olmo Pueblas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8d30f0f088a2757b3837824438d8a19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sergiodop"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
