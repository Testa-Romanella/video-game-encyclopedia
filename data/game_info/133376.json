And since i have to rework my entire System for progressing and general Terminal command stuff which i barely added today, i decided to upload this version for now, since id rather have something online to show as a proof of concept, than nothing.<br/>I will work on a fix for my super broken spaghetti system of progressing input and realease patches with more content soon, which means that a LOT of things will change lol. nothing will stay like it is right now. this was literally rushed in a few days, i want to get this right because i think this is actually an idea that i have lots of options with. (donations would keep me motivated i guess lol, but ill do it anyway haha)<br/>I hope you enjoy this game.<br/>- Toreole<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19ab811cdc2ec16f6325bd16fecb965b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toreole"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
