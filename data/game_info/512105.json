You must be quick to catch them all or the people and cities will die or explode. Can you catch all the bombs and can you\u00a0 complete all 10 challenging levels of this Classic Arcade style game? Try it yourself to see!! Yes it's a very short game and can be completed in about 12 minutes, but was very intricate and monotonous to create every event in the game in certain sequence to fall on each level. 12 minutes of Gameplay, but nearly 3 weeks of coding and custom screens and bomb sprites along with totally custom Player Buckets used to catch the bombs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40d6dd81959165482a91ce9a92825008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Todd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
