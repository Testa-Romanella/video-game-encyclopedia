This house is home to the Witchkin--a family of terrifying toys, the children of a deranged woman known as the Candy Lady. Using her \u201cchildren\u201d, she will do everything in her power to keep all who enter the house from ever leaving.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe base play mechanics of Witchkin are primarily stealth. Sneaking, hiding, staying quiet and aware of the toys and your surroundings are skills required throughout the game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWitchkin boasts a very strong and unique art style reminiscent of early silent movies, painted in the eerie sepia tones of postmortem photos and the murky shadows of nightmares.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f92a2d6ba76b9e769489db57df0c013.jpg", "website": "https://www.covengames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coven Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coven Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
