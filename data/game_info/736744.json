He can wall jump and slide, and even has to defeat a mega boss! ~ Dedicated to Jerementor for putting together some great Construct 2 tutorials back before Construct 3 existed, so it was an interesting experiment to work in the conventions established in those tutorials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some features have surely improved since, but the base coding used in the original translated over to this version as well. Some of the features still feel like they need some smoothing over (the sound fx cutting off, for example, and the rather anticlimactic boss deaths and hero deaths), but may try to build off of this. It's a great tutorial series on Youtube:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b0af4248eae8a38aa2d6e9e2df741aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["atheymr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
