The frogs will attempt to snag any snacks they see along the way, however, the more they snack the fatter they get, thus making it hard for the bird to carry them across the finish line. You can bump into other birds to knock their frogs closer to the fruit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Criteria explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>#1 Kart Racer: A vehicle was described to me as something carrying something else from point A to point B. The thicken (bird) is carrying the greedy frog across the pond to the finish line.</p>\n<p>#2\u00a0Skittles: Fruit flavored sweets are floating in bubbles along the pond! They correspond with the actual skittles flavors.</p>\n<p>#3 Anatomically Incorrect: The chonky bird has teeny wings, and a tiny beak. The frog can also grow beyond what one would consider normal for a frog.<br/></p>\n<p>#4 Chiptune: The soundtrack is all chiptunes!
