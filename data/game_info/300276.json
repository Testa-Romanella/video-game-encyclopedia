{"id": 300276, "slug": "infection-leaves", "name": "Infection (leaves)", "name_original": "Infection (leaves)", "description": "Read After Play\uff1a\r\n<p>Infection is a Twine game talking about two people in an apocalypse. Amy is an orphan and Mark is a person who has let her into his basement. Outside, the city is cut off because of a sickness, a fungal infection, that is contagious and may even turn people into white-eyed monsters.</p>\n<p>Mark is a loner \u2013 a person who distrust everyone. He let Amy in only because she brought much-needed food. He is cruel to Amy and doesn\u2019t share. Amy doesn\u2019t expect better, she is used to people treating her callously.</p>\n<p>I wish to let players feel the \"character arc\" of Mark.\u00a0 You can go through the story if you treat Amy better (Stop her and go to downtown yourself). However, people\u2019s relationship builds faster when bad things happen (More plots happened when you let Amy goes and she gets sick).</p>\n<p>I used a long time to balance the choices. It\u2019s a choice game that I wish to make every choice mattered and reasonable. This is my first time writing such a long story and this is also my first time using Twine. Wish you enjoy this story.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea5a3b1aaf7bd838f2ca41926b19809.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leaves"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
