However, this unseen terror has killed one of the creatures and taken its form, so you don't know which one of them is the evil one. Now it is up to you to take care of them and keep their hunter far away!</p>\n<p><strong>INFORMATION:</strong></p>\n<p>This project was an attempt to make a \u201cVirtual Pet + Horror\u201d game. The Horror part was not like we wanted it to be, but due to the time running out, we had to make some changes to the game\u2019s mechanics.</p>\n<p>Some stuff was also not correctly implemented, such as the cleaning and sanity mechanics. Also, right now there\u2019s no way to identify the correct disguised alien\u2026 However, those will be addressed soon!</p>\n<p>However, the game will be updated over its Itch.io page. So check the links below to stay tuned, as we\u2019ll have updates soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d137b78eac9016a3d4fc50439200a12e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["JohnnyR", "tberardinelli", "bryanstorming", "Ren\u00e9 Abreu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
