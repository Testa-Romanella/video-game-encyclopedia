Hide behind boxes, stick your gun out and shoot, they won't notice, and don't blow your own cover.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n\n\n<p>the serum is a perfect menu for every trigger-happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls :<br/></p>\n<ul><li>[wsad] move, jump, crouch</li><li>[i] open inventory</li><li>[e] interact with objects</li><li>[esc] pause</li><li>123, switch weapon</li><li>[mouse] aim</li><li>[mouse click] shoot</li></ul>\n<p>have fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T23:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a5cd688cbe357188519152ce49c897c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Gland"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
