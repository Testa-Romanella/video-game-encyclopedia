Love.</p>\n<p>Play as a beautiful young woman alone in the forest--or play as a grotesque old creature alone in a decaying windmill. Both must confront the dark corners of their pasts--and determine their futures. Does the future hold love and happiness? Or death and madness? You decide.<br/></p>\n<p>In the style of the Gothic novels you know and love,\u00a0<em>Black Mill</em> is a narrative-based, character-driven game with four possible endings, full voice acting, and an eerily photo-realistic art style that blends\u00a0the hand-drawn with the photographic.</p>\n\n\n<p>Content issues:</p>\n<p>This game does contain blood, partial nudity, suggestiveness, and brief language, but it is all conveyed in an implicit or cartoon manner. (Bear in mind that many books or artwork in the Gothic tradition were considered shocking in their day as well;\u00a0<em>Black Mill</em> does its best to pay homage to the materials that inspired its creation.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f1a84080ebdfc724f7da68d384d7ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tawny Ferrin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
