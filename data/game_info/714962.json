You control Buddy and\u00a0Kiddo, two good kids who had their gifts stolen by Krampy, a mischievous holiday imp! As you recover more gifts you gain more speed, more jumps, sweaters that add a layer of defense and\u00a0weapons such as the\u00a0Plunger Arrow or Noisy\u00a0Gun!</p>\n<p>The game was made as a present to my niece and nephew but I hope you enjoy it as well. It is short and fairly easy but has mechanics that are fun and surprising!</p>\n<p>Here are the controls! It is highly suggested that you use a controller and in order to play 2-player, it is pretty much required.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player 1 (Buddy)\u00a0<br/>Arrows - Move, Crouch\u00a0<br/>Z - Jump, Slide (if crouching)<br/>X - Hold to Shoot\u00a0<br/><br/>Player 2 (Kiddo)\u00a0<br/>A,S,D - Move,\u00a0Crouch\u00a0<br/>J - Jump, Slide (if crouching)<br/>K - Hold to Shoot</p>\n<p>Controllers should work immediately if plugged in. D-input and X-input are both compatible.<br/><br/>Here are the Cheat buttons<br/></p>\n<p>F2 - Restart the Game\u00a0<br/>F3 - Free Gift for each player\u00a0<br/>F4 - 200 Jumps\u00a0<br/>F5 - 10 Speed\u00a0<br/>Pg Up - Skip to Next Room\u00a0<br/>Pg Dn - Skip to Previous\u00a0Room</p>\n<p>That's about it. Happy\u00a0Holidays and Merry Christmas!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b76f9f1665bc569329f0b09fe18cd93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[noblelemon]"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
