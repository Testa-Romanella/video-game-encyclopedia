Lil Junk Bot is a lil bit jank though so he sometimes ends up dropping his upgrades after a hard fight. Help Lil Junk Bot collect as many upgrades as possible, if you fall in battle you lose all your progress.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Made for the Game Jobs Live Jam. All assets were made by me and during the Jam.
