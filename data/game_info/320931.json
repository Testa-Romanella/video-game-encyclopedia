{"id": 320931, "slug": "awakening-itch-ethpaw", "name": "Awakening (itch) (ethpaw)", "name_original": "Awakening (itch) (ethpaw)", "description": "<p>Awakening is an action/adventure RPG with Souls-like features. It tells the story of a young adventurer who must venture out alone into the wilderness to save their village from total destruction. They are aided by the Old Man- a once great warrior- who once defeated the very same evil force many years ago. Awakening is open-world, allowing the player to complete quests and explore areas at their own pace. Melee combat is fast-paced and requires players to quickly dodge, counter, and\u00a0 control their stamina. Ranged combat allows for stealth mechanics such as luring enemies out to fight them in smaller, more manageable groups.\u00a0 By defeating enemies and completing quests, the player will grow stronger- allowing them to take on more difficult challenges.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Awakening REQUIRES an Xbox One or Xbox 360 Controller</p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LS<br/>Camera:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RS<br/>Sprint:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0B (Hold)<br/>Dodge:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0B (Press)<br/>Jump:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Y<br/>Interact:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0X<br/>Use Right Item:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RT<br/>Use Left Item:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LS<br/>Fire Bow:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RB/LB (Depends on Hand)<br/>Lock On:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RS (Press)<br/>Cycle Lock:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RS (Press)<br/>Clear Lock:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LS (Press)<br/>Cycle Equipment:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DPad<br/>Quick-Access Menu\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Start</p>\n<p>This full game has dozen enemy types, a final boss fight to coincide with the Main Quest, several location-based side-quests, and a full open-world to explore!
