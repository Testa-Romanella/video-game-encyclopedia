Each minigame has a time limit of 30 seconds so the goal of this game is to get your max speed over 100 in under 30 seconds! This web version is a little laggy but overall works pretty well. Lastly, the slide is randomly generated in real time using Perlin noise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32ae57eb976dd07edd22644292727f14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfc3"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
