Sometimes they are common for a group of people, sometimes they are rare. But there is at least one fear that we all have: fear of <strong>darkness</strong>. You can never know what (or who?) waits you in the darkness.</p>\n<p>In this game darkness hides monsters. While they are in the darkness, you don't see them and they don't see you. But once you noticed that there is something, it will follow you until you're dead.</p>\n<p>You can try to run or you can accept the fight: press space and place a bomb, which will explode and kill monsters. But be careful, the bomb can kill you.</p>\n<p>Kill monsters, collect bonuses and find a key to exit from each level.</p>\n<p>God bless you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T17:32:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/251/251095c0865011e3d5597b1e08995746.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeonMercury"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
