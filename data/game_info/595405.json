{"id": 595405, "slug": "tecta", "name": "Tecta", "name_original": "Tecta", "description": "<p>Tecta is a city planning game where you build your civilization downwards into the sea after catastrophic global warming floods 70% of the world\u2019s landmass. Every turn, you will choose from 3 tiles to place in different ways on your structure. Make your way down to put houses next to more food, and grow your underwater city. If you want more information about a tile, just click on it. But beware, rival factions will soon spawn to influence your citizens and fight with one another. Build a variety of speciality buildings to keep your factions happy and avoid a revolt against you. Each faction wants a different building placed, and are happiest when the building is in their territory and next to a resource of their type. When you run out of food or happiness, the game ends and your score will be based on your total population. Good luck!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/3445b1f9bf5917acfc2cc935b5f86778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Techsec"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
