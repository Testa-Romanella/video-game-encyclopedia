There are 3 other ships waiting to be unlocked, they'll be unlocking shortly, depending on how many aliens you've beaten.</p>\n<p>The game's pretty short, but I hope you'll enjoy playing it.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is welcome! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e39/e39baab6be63e1a4db01a922f37b9c09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ppowersteef"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
