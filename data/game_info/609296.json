You have 30 seconds before your town gets annihilated.</p>\n<p>The game aims to show the futility of the feel-good dopamine rush of social media, where they do little to nothing for actual social or political change. Since this game is meant to spread awareness about it, 50% of the donated proceeds on this itch.io game will go towards the PCRF (Palestine Children's Relief Fund) at http://pcrf.net</p>\n<p>You can also play the game free of charge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef1e45c7f476efa282f1bbac1202e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JMAA GAMES"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
