{"id": 825490, "slug": "paint-by-time", "name": "Paint by Time", "name_original": "Paint by Time", "description": "<p>A painting game of colors restricted by time intervals of 30 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Made for the Colors mini Jam 111. The colors theme inspired me to create a painting game, including a rainbow to paint in!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Limitation: You Are Your Own Enemy. I intrepreted this in my game as when the timer starts, the text tells you which color you need to paint in, but the color of the text is wrong, and misleads you. You have to conquer your own brain to recognize the correct color to paint.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Instructions: Memorize the painting on the memorize page. When the game starts, select the color of the text shown underneath the timer. You have 30 seconds to fill in that portion of the picture by clicking the color in the palette. Fill in all the colors as the timer counts down. Or create your own painting!</p>\n\n<p>Improvements Planned:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Eraser button</p>\n<p>-Ability to change brush size</p>\n<p>-Ability to skip timer</p>\n<p>-More cheer phrases at the results page</p>\n<p>-More pictures to paint</p>\n<p>-Difficulty levels with faster times and randomized colors</p>\n<p>-Ability to save painting</p>\n<p>-Percentage of painting complete to see progress</p>\n<p><em>Heart Of The Ocean by Purrple Cat | https://purrplecat.com/<br/>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/<br/>Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b61/b6106bf118b1e0a6a1050772c71c9d45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lyssillic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
