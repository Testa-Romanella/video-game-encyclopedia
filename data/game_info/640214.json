This <strong>post-apocalyptic TV show</strong> is extremely popular and is transmitted all around what is left of the World we know. Every participant is treated as a hero just for their very presence in the show.<br/><br/>Champions fight for life with creatures <strong>mutated</strong> so heavily that they disgust even the beasts themselves, that\u2019s why they\u2019re only used to fighting in the pit with the gladiators. This is not all you can fear. Most places you'll encounter are covered with <strong>deadly traps</strong>!<br/><br/>You and your friends\u2019 goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible, closing all that mayhem by <strong>conquering bosses</strong>. However, this task is almost unachievable for an ordinary rookie, so the competitors have to approach the challenge more than once, <strong>developing their skills and equipment</strong> in the meantime.<br/><br/>So gear up, invite your friends, and get involved in the most creepy, post-apocalyptic bloodbath!<br/><br/><br/>\ud83d\udd2b JOIN US ON DISCORD \ud83d\udd2b<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T05:50:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d3f1c44a0e2a4bb1d49686168230f2.jpg", "website": "https://vixagames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vixa Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ravenage Games", "Ripples Asia Venture", "Vixa Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
