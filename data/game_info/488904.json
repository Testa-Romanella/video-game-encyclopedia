An average playthrough should take around 30-60 minutes, maybe slightly more if you explore the whole map.<br/><br/>You can check both controller and keyboard controls in the options menu. <br/>All button prompts are for a Playstation controller; there was no time to change them for keyboard users. <br/>Here is a list of the controls and what they correspond to on a keyboard:<br/></p>\r\nRight Stick\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>MouseCamera Control<br/>Left Stick/D-Pad \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>WASDRun/Navigate Menus<br/>x<br/>SpaceJump/Confirm or Select in Menus<br/>(E and Enter also work in menus)<br/>\u25b3EInteract\u25cb<br/>CCrouch/Back in Menus<br/>(Esc also works in menus)<br/>\u25a1<br/>VClawStart<br/>('Options' on PS4)<br/>EscPause/Unpause Game <br/>(Esc also exits menus)<br/><br/>H (only on keyboard)<br/>Show Current Hearts<br/>(hearts can also be seen in the pause menu)<br/><br/>Tab while the game is paused<br/>(only on keyboard)<br/>Super secret screenshot mode<br/>Alt+Ente<br/>(only on keyboard)<br/>Toggle full-screen mode)<br/>(since version 1.0.1.)<br/>\n<p>Feel free to ask any questions about the game, or game development in general as well! <br/>Bug reports are also welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-16T00:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfc/dfcc3997a339deab3b4447b4e195bb3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potentially Odd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
