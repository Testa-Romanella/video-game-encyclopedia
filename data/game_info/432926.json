It is your job to expand the island, offering them new places to explore. However, exploration comes with great danger, and it is your job to keep a balance between their need for new areas to explore and their health. Building new towns may provide them with shelter so they can heal, but will cause more Shrean inhabitants to get interested in adventuring, which means you have even more adventurers to take care of! How many days can you keep adventurers both interested and healthy before someone either perishes or gets bored?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/987184319f78120c698521059ad93d7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LLBlumire"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
