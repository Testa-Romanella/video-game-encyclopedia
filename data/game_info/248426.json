There she must use all of her wits and tools at her disposal to break through the spirit dimension in her search for the missing girl.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that the apartment is haunted and dark deeds were committed in its long history. Her transgression of the site will no doubt awaken restless spirits who were once wronged as well as the far sinister beings that keep the complex possessed.<br/><br/>Armed with only a smartphone, and her psychic abilities to see and hear the supernatural; Kim's chance of survival is small in this cradle of darkness.
