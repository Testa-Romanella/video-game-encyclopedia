I'm just messing around with some different ideas. The game is split into four parts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Asteroids-like gameplay. Press space to fire. All bullets bounce off the walls and can hurt you, as well as the enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Maze. The deadly left side of the screen is coming! Fly through the maze at hyper-speed!<br/></p>\n<p>3. Bosses. Kill the two UFOs to beat the game. They leave deadly chem-trails. <br/></p>\n<p>4. Redemption. If you die, you have a limited amount of time to get your tail-spinning ship into the portal or game over. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Press Enter at title screen, click on the level to begin (One Small Step).<br/></p>\n<p>Use up to accelerate and left/right to turn.  Use space bar to fire.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:30:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f536b6d241ae95721bed79ca6710696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["debatablejam"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
