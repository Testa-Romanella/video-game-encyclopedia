{"id": 791970, "slug": "herro-metro", "name": "Herro-Metro", "name_original": "Herro-Metro", "description": "Herro-Metro is a walking simulator/horror game set at a train station. The game has two levels. The first one is the maze which has a \"monster\" chasing you (the monster is actually a train conductor) and it has a key that you need to find, once you find this key a door opens. Once this door opens you need to find it and go through, once you go through you will\u00a0find yourself in the train station. In the station you will find two people you can talk to. One of the people is a man that appears to be beaten up, he is waiting for the train, he tells you to speak to the bin. The bin actually has a man in it and you can speak to him, he asks you to go and collect all the \"goodies\" floating around the station, when you collect them you find that the train arrives and a green door will appear. Go through this door and you will find yourself on the train with the \"monster\" in front of you. You have nothing to do but walk forward. When you walk forward a message will appear on screen saying that this was the last moment that the character remembers of the trip and that he calls it the Herro-Metro incident.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T09:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/3446c75ce344897f5055519a3fa94748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Olliek123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
