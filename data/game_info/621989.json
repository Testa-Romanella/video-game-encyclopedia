This is an alpha version of the game and may contain bugs and other errors.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>INFO</strong><br/></p>\n<p>War Games is a third person stealth shooter inspired by the Metal Gear Solid series. The game follows a child soldier, fighting for his country against a foreign invasion.</p>\n<p>There isn't much content right now since the game is in early development. More missions, locations and weapons will be added later. Right now, there is one mission which is playable from start to finish. This mission probably won't be in the final game since the map is a place-holder. The point of this alpha is to convey an approximation of what kinds of missions will be in the finished game.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>R - Reload weapon</p>\n<p>C - Tap to crouch, long press to crawl</p>\n<p>X - Equip/Unequip Weapon</p>\n<p>V - Change aim view</p>\n<p>SHIFT (HOLD) - Sprint</p>\n<p>LEFT CONTROL (HOLD) - Walk</p>\n<p>1 - Equip/Unequip Rifle</p>\n<p>2 - Equip/Unequip Pistol</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - Shoot</p>\n<p>RIGHT CLICK - Aim</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>CRAWL EVERYWHERE. Long press C to crawl. Crawling reduces visibility greatly. Crouching helps too but not as much.</li><li>Don't make noise near guards. Hold Left Control to slowly and silently move around. The pistol is suppressed but the rifle isn't.</li><li>Save ammo when possible.</li><li>Bodies can be pushed around and hidden by moving into them.</li><li>When spotted, backtrack while sprinting. Then crawl behind something.</li><li>Don't go underwater.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game by JasonAI.</p>\n<p>Music and\u00a0ambience are from Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 3.
