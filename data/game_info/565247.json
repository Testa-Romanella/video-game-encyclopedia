{"id": 565247, "slug": "mesolithic", "name": "Mesolithic", "name_original": "Mesolithic", "description": "<p>Dev Notes/Retrospective:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jam: 2021 game Parade\u00a0 \u00a0 Theme: \"Strength lies in differences\"</p>\n<p>Completely solo on this game jam project. Doing programming, sound, music, 2d art, textures, design, and implementation in Unity all by oneself is exhausting.<br/></p>\n<p>Theme:\u00a0 The theme is covered by learning from and working together with animals to solve (admittedly easy) puzzles.\u00a0 The idea is that humanity would be nothing without the ability to learn from the natural world.\u00a0\u00a0I focused more on creating an experience and narrative than making the mechanics \"fun\".\u00a0 I used the time period of approximately 10,000-30,000 as a basis for the game assets.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming :\u00a0 Programming suffered a little due to spending so much time on art.\u00a0 It works, but the code is ugly.\u00a0 The coding, for all it's flaws, works as intended with very few issues (The game should always be completable (with both win and lose conditions) and never* error).\u00a0\u00a0As for the \"JUMP\" mechanic.\u00a0 I purposely chose to limit movement while in mid air (original-Castlevania-style).\u00a0 It just made sense in this concept.\u00a0 \u00a0I'm more of\u00a0 a systems-level programmer and I didn't really get to show off any of my fancy system-building skills here.\u00a0 There are some in the source, but many aren't actually used as it was quicker to do things the wrong way rather than the better long-term solution. *Break it, I dare you.</p>\n<p>The UI:\u00a0 You might say, \"What UI?\"\u00a0 and I say, \"Yes, isn't it fantastic?\"\u00a0 I enjoy minimal UI design.\u00a0 I hate when screens fill up with sliders and progress bars when other elements can give the player the same information.\u00a0 Yes, the text probably should have faded over time, but I didn't want my players to get lost by not reading quickly enough.\u00a0\u00a0The one flaw that is present is that there is no indicator of how long you need to perform an action...my bad, but it is always 2.5-5 seconds (with some variance for processing time as some depend on framerate rather than an explicit time check) provided you are within a close enough range to the target receiving the action.</p>\n<p>Audio : I am getting better at sound design.\u00a0 I'm pretty happy with my sound effects,\u00a0and the setting allowed me to be a bit experimental with the music, although staying close to instruments available during the Mesolithic era.\u00a0 To a non-musical person there may be an uncomfortable amount of off-beats and discordance at times, but I wanted my early hominid melodies to not strictly represent what we think of as good music today.\u00a0 I did overall feel limited in the instrument selection, as I only used a basic midi library from MuseScore.</p>\n<p>Level Design : ...wasn't really done.\u00a0 It is minimal.\u00a0\u00a0This could be an expansive single-level puzzle platformer if I had 20 more hours to work on it.\u00a0 Also, not enough things are prefabs.\u00a0 I did a lot of in-scene editing as there wasn't a need for a lot of reuse of the same assets.\u00a0 The game progress should at least be discernable through context, although there is not helpful reminder of the controls if you forget (or fail to read the prompt before it gets replaced).</p>\n<p>Used Assets :\u00a0Fonts used are free for personal use at dafont.com.\u00a0 Some background art was taken from photos of real cave art and edited for use in the game. Everything else was 100% me.\u00a0\u00a0It should be\u00a0pretty clear what is created by me\u00a0and what is not. (read: which can be recreated by your average toddler is my art, photographs look like photographs).\u00a0 \u00a0Art and textures were created and edited using Paint 3D... like a real pro.</p>\n<p>Design :\u00a0The choice to use 2.5D was in part\u00a0a limitation of my own artistic capabilities, which still wanting some level of depth.\u00a0 I think the added depth works well with the concept.\u00a0 I especially enjoyed working with the layer order and shadows (with working daylight and a moving fire as light sources).\u00a0 I am certain some of the shadows are a bit off, but fixing them during the jam would have yielded too little impact for effort.</p>\n<p>Limitations :\u00a0\u00a0In the end, due to time constraints,\u00a0I cut an event that would interact with a raven and see the player transform and fly away to represent the player's cycle of life ending and adding in a bit of mythology.\u00a0 I don't think the experience suffers for not having it, but it certainly would have been cool.\u00a0 The code would have taken all of 20 mins, but creating the art assets is a challenge for me.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>No digital animals were harmed by the player in the making of this game. Other animals however, did get a bit hungry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T04:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3f/d3f83021f21c701c5357ccf24dbc3514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheezyrock"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
