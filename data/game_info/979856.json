Jump carefully: every chasm is a chance to fall right back to the beginning. When you see the spider, hide. It can hear your little footsteps.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is one big vertical level, which means you can fall right back to the beginning. We didn't make it to be cruel. We like that sweaty-palms feeling you get when you know the stakes are high. It\u2019s a spicy feeling. We think you\u2019ll like it too. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The spider roams the whole map. If it sees or hears you, it will chase you. If it catches you, you die. You cannot fight it, your only hope is to hide where it can\u2019t get you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Controls are simple to learn but deep and expressive once you get to know them. And especially once you get the double jump :)<br/></li><li> One giant vertical level.<br/></li><li> Every inch of \"progress\" is saved, forward and backward.<br/></li><li> Condescending commentary from God.<br/></li><li> 2-7 hours of pain and suffering playtime. Only one person has beaten this game in under 1.5 hours. Most people take around 5. <br/></li><li> Full control remapping.<br/></li><li> Almost full controller support. The only reason it's not listed that way is the graphics menu doesn't work with a controller - everything else does!<br/></li><li> Slo-Mo mode, useful for new players to the genre, or for experts to practice tricks.<br/></li><li> Optional challenge modes:<br/><ul><li> \"No jump preview\" mode which basically turns the game into Double Jump King.<br/></li><li> \"Darkness\" mode, where you'll need to memorize the map to succeed.<br/></li><li> Built-in speedrun timer, if you're into that kind of thing.</li></ul></li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820000/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T10:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8abed4e19f1b5e2258bccefe1866fa73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Rebel Jester Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Rebel Jester Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
