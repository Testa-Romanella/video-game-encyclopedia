This project took roughly 4 weeks with 7 people and was developed exclusively for Android. I served as a general game designer and handled the documentation and UX testing\u00a0for the game. This project was made in the Unity Engine. The biggest challenge the team faced was finding the right art style and the best way to scale the difficulty. We just decided to throw the player into this game without properly introducing them to the mechanics it had and so we scaled the difficulty down at the beginning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a5440c6c17665dbd1a4841d1c7c27b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Steven Eirman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
