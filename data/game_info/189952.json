The game features two teams in which a player can be a part of, either Hacker or Trackers. The hacker (One Player) objective is to successfully hack at least four terminals before the time runs out, all while avoiding the trackers at all costs. The trackers (up to three players) objective is to work as a team to stop the hacker by finding and eliminating the hacker before the time runs out. Enjoy a fun fast game to test who among you is the stealthiest and most skillful hacker.</p>\n\n<p>Warning: This build is just a prototype, this version was made fully during the 2018 Global Game Jam.
