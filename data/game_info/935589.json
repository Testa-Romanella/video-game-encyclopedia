Also a grid system!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3dc8b5af185617448f642f4df3fab64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["K4ution"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
