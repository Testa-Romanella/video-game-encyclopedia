The entire universe has been run over by something similar to grey goo, hellbent on... killing you! Defend your two robots and their singular electron they use for power from the horde of oversized nanobots. More details &amp;\u00a0controls can be found in the game by clicking any button on the title screen.</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of GMTK's 48-hour game jam in 2021, following the theme \"Joined Together\". All art assets were either made by me or included in Unity's packages. Audio effects are both from\u00a0freesound.org\u00a0and BFXR, while the music was made by a friend who wishes to remain unnamed. All art, sound, and music that wasn't taken from Unity or freesound.org was made during or just before the jam (I was learning to use BFXR and included some of the sounds I\u00a0made there in this game).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75fd60d6ee2de56fc5423e9a69c2fc08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BiffenB"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
