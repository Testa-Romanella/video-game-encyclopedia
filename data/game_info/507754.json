The term <em>bowling</em> usually refers to ten-pin bowling, though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries bowling could also refer to lawn bowls.<br/></p>\n<p>In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a lane. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that vary ball path trajectories and characteristics. Common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, five-pin and kegel. The historical game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.\r\n</p>\n<p>In target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible.  The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic.  Lawn bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, p\u00e9tanque, and boules may have both indoor and outdoor varieties.\r\n</p>\n<p>Bowling is played by 100 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million in the United States alone), and is the subject of video games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:54:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac1ebc5330f8cbe37fa5228e54423c7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoAverageJ0E", "matsuringo"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
