It was a short project designed to explore how very young children interacted with point-and-click games, and to reinforce ideas like cause-and-effect and object permanence.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play the game here on Itch, or via a fullscreen page on my own site.<br/></p>\n<p>Halloween Touch was made in  Flash and bundled for Android via Adobe Air. It's no longer supported on modern Android devices, and only runs in a few modern browsers. If you're having trouble running the game, you may need to load it up in Desktop Chrome.<br/></p>\n<p> All code is MIT licensed.
