Your mission is to escape your own reality by literally running away from it. But time waits for no one\u2026and your fate is inevitably bound to your own reality.\r\n</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>You cannot stop (unless you hit a wall), or voluntarily change your own direction.\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - jump/wallhop. Wallhopping increases your speed slightly and reverses your direction. Left Shift - teleport. This warps you a short distance at the cost of your speed force. Q - bullet time. This slows down the time around you at the cost of your speed force. Right Shift - phase. When you reach a high speed (50), summon an energy blade to cut open a rift, phasing through all terrain while moving at max speed. This ability cannot be used consecutively. Right Shift while phasing to cancel prematurely.\r\n</p>\n<p>When your speed is below a threshold, a timer (the green wheel) will start to tick down. Once the timer runs out, well, you know what happens. The wheel will recharge if you remain above the threshold.\r\n</p>\n<p>The stage is ephemeral - moving past a certain point may cause the past terrain to shift, meaning you can traverse forwards or backwards</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Our team consisted of 3 people - 2 of whom are programmers, and 1 a composer. We originally had an artist, but they didn\u2019t show up. Thus, aside from the background of the main game (we really didn\u2019t have time), all animations, art for the platform and the player are original. We did not opt out of Graphics for that reason, since the Artifact\u2019s anims took a significant chunk of our time to implement.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you wish to vote on Ludum Dare's website, please keep in mind that the background is not original (adapted from the Warped City Unity asset pack)! We would like your input on the style and animation of our player (even though it\u2019s a stick figure) as well as the post-processing effects.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This is the LD50 submission for ACM Studio's team 1. Made by Alex Stavedahl (NotALobster), Austin Burkett (FutureYou), and Ming Zhu (Do3naut).</p>\n<p>Update: I'm not sure if LD still allows file uploads, but I figured downloadables might be nice, so I included a windows build here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T17:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/1692a28124e4e392fbe451df27063f79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FutureYou", "Do3naut", "NotALobster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
