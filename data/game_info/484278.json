Players will proceed down an endless route accumulating score, avoiding obstacles, and collecting ability tokens. Ability tokens help fuel both Boomer &amp; Zoomer's abilities, whichever one of their 3 they choose to use.\u00a0<p>Work Together To:</p>\n<ul><li>Get the highscore!</li><li>Pop deadly water balloons!</li><li>Cut through inconvenient rope!</li><li>Navigate tricky obstacles!</li><li><strong>Become better friends with your player 2</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>B &amp; Z relies heavily on the input of a joystick for optimal play, as it allows much better (and the intended) control of movement &amp; aim. However, the \"How To Play\" section of the menu lists both controls for Xbox controllers as well as Keyboard input.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a casual project made over Summer 2020 by Aidan Takami (Engineering &amp; Design), Alan Karbachinsky(Design &amp; Original Models/Textures), and Zoe Morfas (Composer). We really enjoyed making it, and hope you enjoy playing it!<br/></p>\n\r\nSkyboxes from\u00a0hdri haven\r\nSoundFX paid for\r\nController Vibration in this game uses XInputDotNet, found here.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b235103109e3ddb24da8ec3971bc6a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan Takami", "AlanKarbachinsky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
