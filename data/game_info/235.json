Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn&#39;t take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work togehter (and occasionally stab each other in the back).<br />\nExperience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds:<br />\nExplore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident!<br />\nUncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests...<br />\n... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you...<br />\n... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves!<br />\nThe twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability\u2122.<br />\nThe game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content.
