This time the Brakeys Game jam. The Brakeys game jam lasted for a week and had the theme: Rewind. I interpreted the theme in such a way that I could rewind a long time and so the previous game lives of that The main character Noa had to play. By then I die and click on next life I get to the next life of Noa. I support 3 different genres in my game: including an RPG, tower defense and speedrun. All graphics are self-made and programming music tracks were also homemade but most of the sound effects weren't. Have fun playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/655/655784983985a66efd0dac8e45c2a0e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryder Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
