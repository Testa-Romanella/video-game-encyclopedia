Enemies can't hurt you directly, but if they catch the small lights, then you will loose a piece of your inner light.</p>\n\n<p>This game was mode for Hyper Casual Jam with the theme of \"conundrum.\" My implementation for that theme is \"Why must we protect the light?\" If you don't protect the light, eventually you find out why. There was also a limitation of \"3 colors\", while i have used only 3 colors, some effects i used may cause shades and variations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and thanks in advance for your feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e34d77b9a7f05fda3c0157f18efa23e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
