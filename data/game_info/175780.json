We spent our time developing the mechanic by story boarding the idea then making it from scratch in Unity. The game took a team of 5 people. It was all made in less than 52 hours. The game is called 'Finite' and it is based on the idea of controlling time and manipulating time to your benefit for the platforms to cooperate. This demo is used to display the mechanic and also create something unique in a short time frame.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Heriberto Calderon - 3D Artist / Producer ( www.iambert.net )</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Krystyniak - 3D Artist / UI Artist ( www.katiekrystyniak.com\u00a0)</p>\n<p>Jono Rickard - Programmer (\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonorickard\u00a0)</p>\n<p>Bryan Mackenzie - Programmer ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-mackenzie/</p>\n<p>Oscar Coen - Audio ( http://soundlister.com/portfolio/oscar-coen/\u00a0 )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bb/8bb16ba202d003a3490bd0c09cfde801.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bert_In_3D"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
