Unfortunately I had a ton of plans for the game I didn't get to implement or polish up or even have the chance to add audio. Also due to having to my time limitations\u00a0I didn't get to implement my interpretation of the theme although I have a small bit of the multifunction in the game; I know my game wont score high due to this. Once again I didn't get to polish the game but I hope to whoever plays it that you enjoy either way<br/>Also the fullscreen button broke after packaging the game :(<br/><br/>CONTROLS - MOUSE AND KEYBOARD<br/><br/>WASD -Movement<br/>E -\u00a0Interaction Button<br/>Spacebar -jump<br/>Spacebar pressed twice - use glider (once\u00a0Unlocked)<br/>Esc / P - Pause/Unpause Game<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse - Camera Movement<br/></p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS -\u00a0CONTROLLER<br/></p>\n<p>Left stick\u00a0-\u00a0Movement</p>\n<p>Right\u00a0Stick -Camera Movement</p>\n<p>Bottom\u00a0Face button -\u00a0jump</p>\n<p>Bottom\u00a0Face button twice -\u00a0use glider (once\u00a0Unlocked)</p>\n<p>Left Face Button - Interaction Button<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/008066f8cbb1a04c43d3d5013c771000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Russell Rogers Stone III"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
