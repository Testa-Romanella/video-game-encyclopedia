The goal for the assignment was to remake 2 old school arcade retro games.</p>\n<p>I chose to remake space\u00a0invaders and Pong, while these remakes are very rough and I tried to not make them exact copies, I just thought I would upload it for the experience. I plan on making other small games throughout the rest of the year and in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T22:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6dfe41c9579dbbb849c3e4c50d43d17c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mcleen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
