This game is inspired by hard platformer games like Jump King and Get Over It, and a lot of little indie game projects I\u2019ve seen recently.   </p>\n<p>You will be playing as a small creature, who can only move by jumping, you have to navigate over trees without falling into the fire below. You can turn from jumping left and right with WASD you click A then jump to go left and click D to jump right. You can walk by clicking jump constantly.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Scope:\r\n </strong>My idea is to make it a hard puzzle platformer game, I knew immediately I wanted a charge jump then I knew I wanted to let the player turn and jump in different directions. I then wanted to make the platforms hard to land on, so this game relies heavy on the level design.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/faefeac22b2289a73fbceb3914af7444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KayB_Design"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
