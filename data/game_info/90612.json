Create your very own weird monstrosity by selecting from 7 base shapes and over 80 different body parts!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>This game is controlled with the mouse. Select parts from the menu on the right and drag them\u00a0over to the joints on the\u00a0base shape on the left.</p><p>Use the menu on the top of the screen to change the cursor's <strong>mode</strong>, change the monster's <strong>base shape</strong>, change the monster's <strong>color</strong>, or <strong>add new joints</strong>.\u00a0Joints with no attached parts will be invisible in <em>show mode</em>, so there is no need to attach a part to every joint.</p><p><strong>Cursor modes:<br/></strong><strong>pointer mode</strong>: left-click to drag monster parts, right-click to drag joints<br/><strong>rotate mode</strong>: left-click to rotate a monster part clockwise, right-click to rotate it counter-clockwise<br/><strong>size mode</strong>: left click to make a monster part bigger, right-click to make it smaller<br/><strong>flip mode</strong>: left click to flip a monster part horizontally, right-click to flip it vertically</p>\n<p>While playing the standalone version of the game, you can quit at any time by pressing\u00a0<strong>Escape</strong>.</p>\n<p>This game is intended to be played at 16:9 resolutions. Playing it in other resolutions may cause some UI features to be partially obscured.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known bugs:<br/></strong>Depending on resolution the 'confirm' and 'cancel' buttons in the color picker popup may be unresponsive. I suspect this is a canvas scaling issue, but I\u00a0have been unable to resolve the problem. If this happens to you, try clicking the <strong>leftmost </strong>part of the button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/6885d946dd167127213efab8614095f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Teljoor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
