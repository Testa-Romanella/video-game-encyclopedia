(Playtime is ~6 minutes)<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game jam and although it was an extremely busy week at work, I made sure to set aside time to participate. I am thrilled to have submitted something and I am grateful for the invaluable experience and knowledge I have gained.\r\n</p>\r\nTools and resources\r\n<ul><li><strong>Unity </strong>served as my game engine as it's reliable and familiar allowing me to work quickly.</li><li><strong>Yarnspinner </strong>helped to create an immersive dialogue system that was easy to implement. </li><li><strong>Zapsplat.com</strong> provided all the high-quality audio components for the game.</li><li>For art, I utilized both <strong>Inkscape </strong>for vector art and <strong>Krita </strong>for raster art. The use of these tools allowed me to bring the visuals to life.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Overall, I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished with this project and I am excited to continue improving my skills as a game developer. Thank you for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:10:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002a272897f9c6182716f4bcba20e3eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paulBoxman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
