While serving to reveal University life to prospective students, the pop-up alerts will also bridge the social divide by introducing community members and events.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kayla Baylock:</strong>\u00a0User-Research<br/><strong>Hannah Brubaker:</strong>\u00a0Strategic Planning<br/><strong>Chance Coelho:</strong>\u00a0Materials and texture artist<br/><strong>Zack Foy:</strong>\u00a0World Builder<br/><strong>Payton Grady:</strong>\u00a0Engineering<br/><strong>Jay Handwerk:</strong>\u00a0Engineering<br/><strong>Anna Harris:\u00a0</strong>User-Research<br/><strong>Spencer Hazen:</strong>\u00a0User-Interface Design<br/><strong>Christian Hsieh:\u00a0</strong>3D Modeling<br/><strong>Jonathan Jackson:</strong>\u00a0Audio Composer<br/><strong>James Last:</strong>\u00a0Creative Direction<br/><strong>Ferris Lewis:</strong>\u00a0Materials and Texture Artist<br/><strong>Julia\t</strong><strong>Oliver:</strong>\u00a0World Builder<br/><strong>Matt Reynolds:\u00a0</strong>Project Management<br/><strong>Kendrick Tran:</strong>\u00a0UI Designer<br/><strong>Kathy Xiao:</strong>\u00a03D Modeling and Curating<br/><strong>Brian Heagney: </strong>Faculty Advisor</p>\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p>\n<p>In order to appreciate the work that the students did,\u00a0I want to take a moment to highlight some of the achievements.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Development Skills:</strong> before this course,\u00a0very few of the students (including the Game Design students)\u00a0had ever worked with Unreal Engine (UE4). In fact, few of them had ever used any digital game development software before. UE4 is an extremely complicated software that can take years to master, and these students developed a working demo in a very short matter of time with very little experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Collaborative Software:</strong> Not only did the students learn UE4 for this project, but all students learned how to use Github Desktop, which allowed every single student to work on one project at the same time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In terms of Premiere, it would be like having 12 students all working on the exact same Premiere Project where one student works on developing lower thirds, another works on marking up audio interviews, another edits subclips, etc. In game design, this is a fairly complicated topic, yet each student maintained their own part of the project, and we ultimately were able to implement most of everyone's work into the one final project.</p>\n<p><strong>User-Experience: </strong>Our Strat COM students worked hard to drive the game design half by looking to real data. Early on the students developed and circulated surveys for their feelings of dorm rooms which we then used to help us pick which dorm rooms to model.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some students learned how to run the Beacon Lab's eye-tracking software to analyze our UI designs.</p>\n<p><strong>Campus Chronicle:</strong> James Last contacted the Campus Chronicle to pitch a story and ultimately wrote up a wonderful article about the work we were doing. Link here:\u00a0<br/>https://www.campus-chronicle.com/2020/10/28/student-developers-create-interactiv...</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>\n<p>The students in this course planned, designed, and developed most of this work. I, as the faculty advisor, did take on some responsibilities to put some of the more complicated components together, which I'll list here:</p>\n<p><strong>Animations:</strong> I programmed the animation for the desk, but the model was fully developed and prepared by students. Additionally, I did animate the phone and the cupboard door.</p>\n<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> While students did initial research for highlighting objects, I did finish the programming because it was very\u00a0advanced.</p>\n<p><strong>Pop-up Programming:</strong> While students developed and programmed the animation for the user interface components, I personally programmed a second part of the system, which tells the game which user-interface topic to implement based on the clicked object.</p>\n<p><strong>PITCH DECK</strong></p>\n<p>The following pitch deck was developed by the students in the course to pitch this simulation.
