Someone or something has\u00a0been building giant towers in the sea and they didn't even apply for\u00a0planning permission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the offices of Destructo Inc. you awake from your afternoon nap\u00a0with the phone almost erupting on your desk. The boss is shouting about\u00a0some little destruction job he's got for you. Still half asleep talking\u00a0about the brand new Mk.7 Mini-Sub he's got for you and the words \"pay\u00a0rise\" you're out of your office in a flash, leaving the phone dangling\u00a0out of the window as the boss goes on to talk about the extreme danger\u00a0involved...\u00a0</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n<p>On the title screen left/right arrows select the starting level from 1 to the furthest tower you've previously reached.<br/></p>\r\nPLAYING THE GAME\r\n<p>You arrive at the bottom of each tower in your trusty submarine. Climb to the top of the tower within the allowed time. The towers are covered with various ledges, tunnels and lifts. You may also discover ledges which dissolve when you stand on them and slippery ledges which will push you left or right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flashing blocks and bouncing balls can be destroyed by shooting them but the silver rolling balls can only be stopped in their tracks for a few seconds. All other creatures are indestructible. If hit by a creature, you will tumble off the ledge and land a few levels down. If you fall in the sea, you lose a life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Entering the final door at the top of the tower sets off the destruction sequence. You are awarded bonuses for the time left and for technique and the tower will crumble into the sea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a tower has been destroyed you get back in your submarine and travel underwater to the next tower.\u00a0During this\u00a0time you can pick up bonuses by catching fish. This is achieved by\u00a0shooting air bubbles to capture the fish, which can then be collected.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Nebulus was originally created by John M Phillips (@JohnMPhillips6) in 1987 for the C64. He did the design, graphics, music/sfx and\u00a0code, as well as going on to make the ZX Spectrum, Amiga and Atari ST versions! The Amstrad CPC version was created by\u00a0Chris Wood (graphics and code) and Dave Rogers (music/sfx and sound driver). The original cassette inlay art was created by Steve Weston. Nebulus was published by Hewson.</p>\n<p>This fan-remake for the PICO-8 fantasy console borrows heavily from the above creator's work.
