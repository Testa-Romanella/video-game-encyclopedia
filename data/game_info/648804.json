On lower and mid-range machines, this will be quite noticeable.\u00a0\u00a0if your game is running slowly, lowering the difficulty slider will help.\u00a0\u00a0We have a plan to move away from bone attachments, but it's a pretty big change and will require a few days.\u00a0 Or kill the skeletons, causing their weapons to vanish, which speeds things up nicely.</li><li><strong>The current animations don't allow Aria to move and attack</strong> or move and sheathe/unsheathe her weapon at the same time.</li><li>The shop isn't there yet.</li><li>Not equipping a weapon and trying to attack that weapon does nothing.\u00a0 This isn't technically a bug or an issue, but someone reported it as a bug because \"I don't read notes\" and writing \"some people don't read\" as a known issue felt mean.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>This prototype was built using placeholder animations, sounds and UI elements.\u00a0 We will be redoing them for the courses.\u00a0</li><li>Everything you see here is a work in progress.</li><li>This was built with Godot 3.3.\u00a0 We will be reworking it for Godot 4 when it;s released</li></ol>\n<p><strong>If you want to see this prototype turn into a series of courses in Godot 4, Blender and LMMS,\u00a0support our Kickstarter campaign\u00a0today!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/412e5c4ae47b1288b7eea6de33f6e7b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Canopy Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
