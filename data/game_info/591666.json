Through spending time with your pet, you will learn who they are: what kinds of food they like, what forms of play they enjoy, how comfortable they are in social situations, whether they're a cuddly sort or prefer their personal space, and many other things. This information will help you to give them the best possible care and make them happy.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, your pet is an embryo in an incubation tank, and all you need to worry about is setting their diet and responding to an occasional event. As your pet grows older, you will have to manage a growing set of responsibilities including scheduling playtime, training them in life skills, and responding to a wide variety of events that can occur in your pet's life. Effectively managing all of these things will require you to become thoroughly familiar with your pet's unique personality and needs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3ed10ccc8303c4b38adf5a97a95f8b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeamBrain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
