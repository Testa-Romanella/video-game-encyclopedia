As a Perimeter Officer, you are in charge of accepting or denying people entry into Astralin, all in accordance with a set of rules determined by your commanding officers.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each week, you will have to be able to afford food and leisure for your family, or else severe consequences could be inflicted. Each valid person admitted or each illegal person denied will earn the Perimeter Officer credits which can be used to purchase these items.</p>\n\n<p>This is an early\u00a0work in progress, inspired by Papers, Please. I wanted to make my own take of the game, possibly enhancing some features even. There will certainly be bugs, and scaling issues will most likely occur but other than that enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/477ed6811b9087764e45bbdf4c62fdbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Existential Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
