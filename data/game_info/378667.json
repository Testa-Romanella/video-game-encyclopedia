On the way you'll need to form a strategy and pick the right skills and items to support it.<br/><br/>CYBORc is heavily influenced by classic ARPGs, complete with randomly constructed levels, enemy spawns and itemization. The game keeps going after completion, so you'll never run out of things to do!<br/><br/>- Sit back and watch the cyborc fight its way through the dungeons. Use time warps to compensate for lost IRL time.<br/><br/>- Not a mindless clicker game. You develop your own strategy and deck out your character with items and skills to progress as far as possible.<br/><br/>- Random combinations of properties allow for endless equipment possibilities.<br/><br/>- Increasing difficulty levels keep you challenged indefinitely.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T02:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5bdc9e4cef0e36bc4eb11fa50ab3a23_MLzXiFE.jpg", "website": "http://andretaono.com/cyborc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Andre Taono"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Andre Taono"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
