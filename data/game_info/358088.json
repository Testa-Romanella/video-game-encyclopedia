Your tank contains a range of different fish which you&#39;ll need to keep fed. Some of the fish eat fish food while others eat their fellow fishtank inhabitants. But keeping your fish fed isn&#39;t the only challenge: hostile aliens also show up in the tank and have to be fought off.<br />\nonce you&#39;ve completed Adventure mode you can take on more challenging trials or just play around in the virtual tank. Unlike most puzzle games this one has a significant resource management element which will appeal to fans of strategy games. Fighting the aliens and feeding the fish are simple in terms of the required actions but keeping up with the resources you need can be challenging.<br />\nInsaniquarium is playable and casual game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-04T17:15:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c98b10a9437a9299a54e2d916c9eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["LinkLock"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Touchstone Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
