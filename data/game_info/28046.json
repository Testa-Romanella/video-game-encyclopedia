{"id": 28046, "slug": "dead", "name": "Dead", "name_original": "Dead", "description": "Dead is a Zombie focused local co-op game.<h3>Zombie Co-op Mode:</h3>This mode is a kill based survival mode. This is a good way to learn how zombies, weapons, and game mechanics work without having to worry about facing off against other players in the game. Each map has a scoreboard to go along with it so you can show off to your friends.<br/><br/>For players who own the free game, they will get 3 maps at launch: Box, Grand Hall, and Quad. More maps may be added for free after this for the free version.<br/><br/>For players who own the game fully, they will get, at launch, Space Studio, Ash, and Fortress. More maps will be added as time passes. <br/><br/>The game is also a <strong>Community-Driven</strong> game. The discussion board will be looked at daily or hourly if I have the time to do so because people are what drives me to make content like this.<br/><br/><strong>The game is a game I started making May 1st 2020. The game will have an update every chance we get depending on what's wrong or what's needed to go out. It's a fun hobby game I, George, made because there is not a lot going on right now and it took about a week to make. It will be updated as needed and added to when there is time/demand. </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed915a8ae4dc90b6ed5b4996083ae122.jpg", "website": "http://www.milo-games.co.uk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 35}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alec Smith", "Matthew lonsdale", "George Hennen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Milo Games", "Matthew lonsdale", "People Eater Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
