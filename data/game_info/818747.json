Be careful to not shoot too many dice at once or you will become slower.\u00a0<strong>Survive all 10 waves to win!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programs used - Unity, Aseprite, Audacity</p>\n<p>Music from Zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/166/166b3d3ae43ebe4cc70ecd4dda9e632f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BuhPoi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
