Let me know if you have any issues. Also, if the game runs too slow for you, try disabling VFX and the HUD in the options in the main menu, or download the Windows version of the game (which even includes keyboard/gamepad mapping and other options)</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>UNITRES LUCID </em></strong> is a 2D arcade platformer created by Unlimited Trees. It is recommended you've played 'TREES' ADVENTURE' or 'UNITRES Dreams' before playing this.\u00a0 This prototype features 14 test levels as well as various extra modes.</p>\n<p>SUPPORT THE GAME ON PATREON\r\n</p>\n<p>PLAY THE DEMO AT NEWGROUNDS</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Main Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each level has 4 'ROUNDS'. In order to complete each round, you need to collect enough 'Stars' and 'Star Rings' to fill up the bar on the top-left of the HUD. After doing so, an object will appear which, when collected, advances you to the next round (as well as awarding extra Score and Time when collecting more Stars/Star Rings). Completing all 4 ROUNDS will reset the level back to ROUND 1.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the normal Score Attack mode, you have a timer which begins at 120. Once it reaches 0, the level ends.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The movement is the same as 'TREES' ADVENTURE', so it is recommended to play that game's demo before this game. The main difference is the way slopes affect the player's speed. Running down a slope will speed up the player, whille running up a slope decreases your speed. Slopes will affect you greater when sliding, so keep that in mind. Slopes also affect your jump, where generally jumping up a slope will give greater height but less distance, while jumping down a slope gives less height but greater speed. Lastly, landing on a steep slope will transfer your falling speed to your running speed. Overall, the environment can really be used to move around very quickly. The environment is your friend.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are various enemies which will try to stop 'Trees' from progressing. In the normal Score Attack mode, being hurt by an enemy takes away 5 seconds from the Timer. Enemies can be stunned up to 3 times by attacking them, however the only way to defeat them is to collect a Powerup. Shielding will protect you from an enemy's attacks, however you will be stunned for a moment and will be knocked away.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Getting High Scores</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The best way to get high scores is by getting a huge combo. By collecting Star Rings or defeating an enemy, your combo increases by 1. The combo will end when the bar on the top-right of the HUD goes empty, but the bar can be refilled by collecting Stars/Star Rings. Score gained from Stars/Star Rings and Enemies will be multiplied by your Combo.\r\n</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, collecting more Stars before ending a ROUND will increase the Score Bonus. Try to collect as many Stars as you can, while making sure you don't run out of Time.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS (Keyboard)\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys / Number Pad</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move</p>\n<p><strong>A key / Z key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jump, Double Jump, Wall / Floor / Ceiling Jump, Select</p>\n<p><strong>X key / D key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Attack</p>\n<p><strong>S key / C key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Shield, Wall / Floor / Ceiling Climb</p>\n<p><strong>I key / J key / K key / L key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Directional Attack (Inputs for Right Stick on a controller)</p>\n<p><strong>Up key + Z key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Interact</p>\n<p><strong>R key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Restart Level</p>\n<p><strong>9 key</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Return to Main Menu\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS (Gamepad)\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Left Stick / D-pad</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move</p>\n<p><strong>A button / Y button / Left Bumper</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jump, Double Jump, Wall / Floor / Ceiling Jump, Select</p>\n<p><strong>X button / Right Trigger / Right Stick Button</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Attack</p>\n<p><strong>B button / Left Trigger / Right Bumper</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Shield, Wall / Floor / Ceiling Climb</p>\n<p><strong>Right Stick</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Directional Attack</p>\n<p><strong>Up + A button / Y button / Left Bumper</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Interact\r\n</p>\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Created By</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unlimited Trees\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music Composed By</strong>\n</p>\n<p>R3tronaut\r\n</p>\n<p>RRThiel\r\n</p>\n<p>A-S-H\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Very Special Thanks To</strong>\n</p>\n<p>SslTpot\r\n</p>\n<p>milkbarjack\r\n</p>\n<p>pressedyes\r\n</p>\n<p>Andrew75\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Shout Outs to My Crazy and Cool Patreons</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Bman\r\n</p>\n<p>Mew Mew Pyschic\r\n</p>\n<p>Billy Whiteside\r\n</p>\n<p>Dylan Scarlata\r\n</p>\n<p>Zetar\r\n</p>\n<p>LakeFeperd\r\n</p>\n<p>Bonfire\r\n</p>\n<p>peacfulpanda\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:39:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cd41acc9bbcca891c3fbfac4a80eef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Unlimited Trees"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
