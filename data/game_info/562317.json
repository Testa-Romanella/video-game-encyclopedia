Once you've been spotted, <strong>Hunters</strong> can locate you and try to steal your light with their <strong>spikes</strong>.</p>\n<p>As a lost fractured soul, fighting the darkness, you are aware of your inevitable ending. Your future might be getting brighter, but in the end, you are bound to cling to the shadows.</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Movement: </strong>The movement is extremely complicated, all you need to do in order to move is <strong>CLICK!</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Seekers:</strong> When they spot you with their light, they start siphoning your light. They slow you down and alert <strong>Hunters</strong> to your location.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunters: </strong>These bad boys once summoned will target you and attempt to spike you! You can <strong>use your light to deflect them.</strong> If you look at the spikes for a small duration of time, they will be deflected, thus turn around and attempt to cycle back only if you are still spotted by the seekers.</li>\n<li><strong>The strategy:</strong> The best strategy is to click far away at a safe place when a seeker spots you, and use your light to deflect the hunters. Try to move slowly and avoid getting detected by the seekers. <strong>Be careful not to get stuck next to the border of the map,</strong> if you find yourself close to the border while being attacked, attempt to move towards the middle.</li></ul>\n<p><em>Huge thank you to Spikes for coming in clutch with some edits on sounds, and everyone who helped with feedback!<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Game design, models, sounds, music and scripts made by RawSauce using free software (Unity, Blender and Pro Tools First) and some of their default assets.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The only outside resource used is the outline of objects made possible via https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-1154...<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e45ae7153e04e68818b1defe696a773b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RawSauce"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
