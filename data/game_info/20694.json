For the most part, food had been plentiful and easy to acquire...planets made entirely of cheese were abundant, and finding one could leave a bob full for a lifetime. However, time has passed, and food has become scarce. Greedy bobs so carelessly ate two or three cheese planets at a time, and now cheese planets are as rare to find as a bob with a full stomach.<br/><br/>Bobs unable to stumble upon one of the last extremely rare cheese-havens were forced out into the unknown. Now they traverse as many planets as they can in hopes of finding a scrap of food to survive. Unfortunately, their trips are dangerous, and the planets are treacherous. Finding food is not like it used to be.<br/><br/>You play as one of these bobs, and it is up to you to find the meal that will finally satisfy your bob's insatiable appetite. <br/><br/><strong>Play alone, or play online with up to 8-player co-op in four frantic multiplayer modes:</strong><br/> <ul><li><strong>Co-op</strong>: Play with your friends and help one another make it to the end!
