But be careful, if you die you have to start all over again.</p>\n<p>My take on the theme, was that if you fail to kill an enemy after a certain amount of time, after engaging in combat, they grow stronger.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was a way for me to get familiar with the Godot engine, I have tried it in the past but this is my real \"first\" try with it. I tried to keep the project scope small, due to having a full time job and a big family, however there's loads of things I didn't get a chance to add that I truly wanted to be part of this submission.</p>\n<p>I haven't really had a chance to truly test it, apart from while actually coding it. So there's probably plenty of bugs to be found.</p>\n<p>All assets were produced during the jam except for the font which\u00a0 I haven't made myself, unfortunately I didn't get enough time to get some background music made.</p>\n<p>I tried to get export for the web working, but as of yet I haven't succeded. If I get it working, I will be updating it with a web version as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Attack</p><p>Enter - Accept<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/bed23aacb98dab19d6ad300572785a23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["knaas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
