{"id": 726875, "slug": "lucid-dive", "name": "Lucid Dive", "name_original": "Lucid Dive", "description": "<p>Lucid Dive is a 2D action platformer developed in about four months for the Innovation Game Design competition, by a group of university students.\u00a0Lucid Dive is designed as a platformer close to the Mega Man Zero series, but with a side of acrobatic performance.\u00a0The game came in 2nd for best graphics and 1st for best sound design.</p>\n<p>However, we do not plan on continuing development of this game.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we have released it here on itch, because we want the result of our hard efforts to remain somewhere on the Internet. Many other previous participants of the same competition did not release their game elsewhere, and so we wish to change that.</p>\n<p>With that said, this is a very difficult game, possibly only suited for players experienced with 2D platformers. We hope you enjoy it nonetheless.</p>\n<p><strong>This game does not have a life system. You can die however many times you want, but each death deducts 5000 points from your score.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Here is a gameplay demo.</p>\n<p>Feel free to share your times and scores in the comments below!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use A/D keys to move left or right.</li><li>S key to fastfall.</li><li>Space key to jump.</li><li>For the mouse:<ul><li>Left click to attack.<ul><li>When the W key is held, you will attack upwards.</li><li>When the S key is held, you will attack downwards.</li><li>Otherwise, you will attack sideways.</li><li><strong>Note: You cannot attack the boss until the second cutscene.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Hold down the right button to start aiming your hook.<ul><li>When aiming, time will slow down to help you aim.</li><li>A line will be shown in the hook's (straight) trajectory.</li><li>If it is glowing, it means that it will hit something when shot.</li></ul></li><li>Release the right button to launch the hook.<ul><li>You will be pulled to wherever the hook lands, at high speeds.</li><li>Hooking enemies will stun them briefly.</li><li>You cannot hook the boss located at the end of the stage.</li></ul></li><li>There are certain barriers with the marker of a hook before them.
