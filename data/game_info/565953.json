As such, it is very buggy and unpolished. Still, I hope you enjoy what I've done with it. A list of controls is included in the readme file. This game supports both keyboard and XBox controllers. Other controllers may work too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T07:26:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf419c470381351691a4b012041e915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OvacityStudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
