{"id": 15916, "slug": "minecraft-story-mode-complete", "name": "Minecraft: Story Mode", "name_original": "Minecraft: Story Mode", "description": "<p>Minecraft: Story Mode is an action-adventure game developed by TellTale. The title revolves around the episodic series-like narrative and puts the importance of the player&#39;s choices forward.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game resembles the genre of the point-and-click adventures. The players can talk with non-mandatory characters and choose the dialogue options out of four or five alternatives. There is a heavy focus on the QTE \u2014 the sequences where one must mash buttons in time accordingly with the pictograms depicted on the screen. At the end of each chapter, the player is presented with the choice diagram \u2014 his of her picks are compared to those of the other players across the world.  <br />\nIt is not to be forgotten \u2014 Minecraft: Story Mode is the TellTale adaptation of another video game. Fingerprints of this are clear: the crafting mode essential to the original has been added to the game, and the title has become more friendly all in all. That is the contrast with the previous TellTale installments \u2014 they were mainly targeting mature audience. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>The Story Mode created the narrative from the start \u2014 the original game does not feature it. The story centers around Jesse \u2014 the protagonist and the player at the same time \u2014 who travel around the in-game world in searches for The Order of the Stone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:24:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a5e/a5e718412ecc9fc7008b59b2e2a29da1.jpg", "website": "https://telltale.com/series/minecraft-story-mode/", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 65, "owned": 970, "beaten": 217, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 108, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 202, "ratings_count": 301, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 302, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Wii U", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "iOS", "Xbox 360", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
