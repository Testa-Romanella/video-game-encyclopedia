You are a defensive turret, the only unit that stands between the remnants of humanity and the fierce underground invaders. Repel enemy waves by quickly moving between their tunnels and using the right weapons for every foe!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your first mission will be fairly simple: just you and two lanes of Striders, the weakest of alien bugs. Shoot a few rockets into their narcissistic muzzles!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The more you anger the outlandish creatures, the stronger will be the forces they send to break through your defenses. Lansters, for example, are ethereal beings who don't care about conventional weapons. Surprise these elusive scoundrels with a load of silver shackles before you finish them off!<br/><br/>Finally, the strongest of insects will take matters into their own paws. They will dig additional tunnels and arm themselves with powerful explosions to blow you up! Together with the artificial earthquake from your own arsenal, the underground will feel like the hell itself! Will you manage to survive all of this?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T05:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fa/7fad9718d95bc97c5b1d5e251284f330.jpg", "website": "https://www.khud0.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Khud0"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Khud0"], "esrb_rating": null}
