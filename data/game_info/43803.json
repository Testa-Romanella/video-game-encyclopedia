Given your budget for a level, you need to carefully think what objects to buy and carefully plan the exact spots where you place each object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While on first glance it appears similar to tower defense games, this game requires a lot more thinking and certain puzzle-solving skills to keep your pesky little cat alive. A true test of your IQ if played with a normal or high difficulty setting. Or a strategy game that leaves a little bit of room for error with lower difficulty settings.<br/><br/>Our other strategy game: Battles of Norghan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T10:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29caef8ad9b4c74ae35dfbd3fbbc4921.jpg", "website": "http://www.bombdefense.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 179, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mitorah Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mitorah Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
