It was our first game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<em>THE CONCEPT</em>\n<p>\u201cGlitch\u201d was chosen because of the theme. We created a fake glitch loop in the robot system that makes you do actions one after the other. The robot behaviour is dependant of that.\u00a0</p>\n<em>TEAM COMMENT</em>\n<p>We are very proud of what we have done and it\u00a0could bring us to develop, one day,\u00a0a nice and polished\u00a0game based on this concept. However, not everything went well because we did some mistakes, I wanted to \"manage\" a team to learn them how to use Unity and that was for sure a big penalities for this project but I'm still very happy of what we all learnt during these 72 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because all of that, some features like checkpoint are missing. This involves that the game is kind of \"hardcore\" as we couldn't iterate enough on it and the onboarding is not really well done.</p>\n\r\nCREDIT\r\n<p><strong>GAME DESIGN</strong></p>\n<p>Axel FAUX &amp; Jules ALDEA</p>\n\n<p><strong>LEVEL DESIGN - PROGRAMMING - SOUND DESIGN - MUSIC - ENGINE ONBOARDING</strong></p>\n<p>Axel FAUX</p>\n\n<p><strong>PIXEL ART</strong></p>\n<p>Jules ALDEA</p>\n\n<p>And the participation of\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Corentin GOOSSE\r\n</p>\n\r\nThank you for reading and have fun ! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08c/08cba9add353615ff1f5cddfcf991b6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Axel Faux"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
