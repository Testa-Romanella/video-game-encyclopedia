Is everything lost? No! You can use your own will to give orders to the heroes and win the battle.<br/></p>\n<p>ProgrammableHeroes is a turn based game. You give orders to your party which get executed at the end of the turn. The orders are persistent through turns so the same actions happen repeatly if not changed. To change an order you need willpower which is a resource that replenishes every turn. Defeat your enemies before they defeat you to advance to the next level.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>On the right side you can change the actions of your heroes for the next turn. Simply click on the icon to choose between movement and the different attacks. The smaller icon on the right bottom defines the direction of this action.</p>\n<p>Clicking on a hero or monster opens a Info-Window giving more details and explaining available Skills.<br/></p>\n<p>Since there is no save-feature you can directly jump to any level by pressing shift + number of the level (1-7).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Clicking on the panel in order to make a change for your actions will cost you a coin irrespective of whether you make an actual change or just confirm what was selected before.
