He always accepted that with a heartwarming smile: as long as he could continue doing his job that one day of the year, he was happy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>That suddenly took a turn when some people started claiming Santa's presents as their own, some even stealing the gifts from the old man himself.</p>\n<p>Well... now he's had it, and he's got a very different \"Merry Christmas\" to wish them.</p>\n<p>Give them hell.</p>\n\n\n<p>Santa Claus: Unchained was developed in one day and a half as part of the YogsCast Gamejam. This is my first ever game and I'd love to hear your feedback in order to improve as a game developer!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d085098c6cf8ecad4a87474dc120523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["hazoni"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
