I'm Striker a totally indie game dev eloper and this is my project, UniverseBall. It took me a few days making this little game (wich is not finished) where you're like a mini \"god\" and you create your own universe using miniplanets, plants and animals to earn LifePoints which is the in game money.<br/>I designed all the Assets you're watching and I programmed all the functions.<br/>As I said the game is not finished yet. I need to implement new functions like hunger on animals and a hunting system, also to add brand new animals, trees and planets.<br/>I'm proud of the progress I've made and I'll continue developing the game untill finished.<br/>Hope you like the tiny progress I\u00a0 made of this new project.</p>\n<p>*How to Play *<br/>\u00a0* Use WASD Keys to move around the scene<br/>\u00a0* Have fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dff13f914b3244e6f5dfe6c0205d6f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeadStriker012"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
