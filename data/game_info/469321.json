You are tired of the town folk doing nothing... The only way to make things happen? Find actual proof! Armed with your trusted camera and rechargeable flashlight, you set out to find the proof you need to get people to realize they are being HUNTED!</p>\n<p>Inspired by the CreepyPasta created by Trevor Henderson. The graphics were heavily inspired by the Nintendo 64 or PS1 era. This is our very first 3D game, so we hope this will get our foot in the door for future developments.
