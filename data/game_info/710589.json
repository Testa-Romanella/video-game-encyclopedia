Also the enemies are glitched on level 3 and there is also only 3 levels because I wanted to move on to something else so I made the game good enough. If you want to copy the idea and make it better or something I think that would be really cool and you have my full consent.</p>\n<p>--Description--</p>\n<p>You are a blue cube that has to get passed all the enemies. You have no weapons but can move enemies by getting them to chase you then you speed away and they stay there. You also have to reach the portal to get to the next level. There are more directions on the game in the how to play section.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1176313c7e449b95a0b100dd95dbddb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperJonah50"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
