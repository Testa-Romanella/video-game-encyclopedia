I think the endless upgrades suit that well (and I'm especially glad about them since I figured out a way to actually make them endless pretty easily!), and I like how quickly the player's power ramps up too - though maybe that goes up a bit too quickly. Honestly, I would've loved to add about 3 more classes of ships to the game to make the endgame challenge even greater, but it's a bit ambitious to try add in 18 ships whilst keeping everything else up to standard as well. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Generally, I think, what I'd have liked to add to the game is more \"stuff\", maybe even some story to it; right now it's a little open ended, and once you run out of new upgrades and enemies to shoot at it becomes a little repetitive content-wise. I suppose one way of fixing that would be to slow down the game's progress, but that doesn't feel right - what I always love about these sorts of games is how quickly they pick up, so I didn't want to sacrifice that for extra playtime. Really, I guess what I was going for was something like Shellcore Command, if you've ever heard of that. It's a really fun retro shooter, and I took a lot of inspiration from that in this game, so one way of solving the content problem might be just going in a similar direction and adding in some storyline and progress, whilst keeping things open enough. Whatever the case, I'm glad you played the game (and read through all that too!), and I hope you enjoyed playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
