In Slow Burn you pilot a cruiser ship that has just set sail from Earth. Suddenly, an issue arises, a burst in the hull is spraying fuel everywhere. The fuel leak has caused the ships AI to lock down all systems and limit the ship to using one rocket booster at a time so the fuel is burned slowly. Head to the nearest space port whilst collecting uranium fuel spores to survive! Your scores are determined by high and low, High being how long you survived and low being how quickly you survived.</p>\n\n<p>Playable in browser and downloadable</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131f9a95c0a3dd2e590a2a9b661cf11f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adwood53"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
