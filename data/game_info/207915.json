The\u00a0\u00a0planets will orbit around the sun and on their own axis, and if you click on one the camera will follow it.<br/></p>\n<p>Please Note: I may make some adjustments to the camera. Also, on some objects, like the Sun or Jupiter, the camera will zoom out instead of in and make the skybox visible, but this can be corrected by clicking on another planet. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/9979c1132f7643c7691ae67d5b86742f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChaosQueen511"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
