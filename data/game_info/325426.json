The main goal it's to have it's own resources out of the classic RTP.<br/></p>\n<p>Main story is: you was an Hero and you though glory and richness is completelly related to the time when you defeat the main enemy and rescue the pricess. After all most of the tales ended like this with a... they live happily ever after.<br/></p>\n<p>The real world does not work like that and now you find that, cliches aside, you have to work hard to reach your own objetives, even if your ambition is to live a normal life and get someone to be with.</p>\n<p>For me it's uncomplete and unfinished, compared to most of the projects released around the world it is almost complete, but not for me.</p>\n<p>It was a start, and end and something between, but the main goal is to work in every aspect of the game, specially on the side stories and personal background of those who you can date. The game can be played for around 30 hours before reaching any end, it's a bit repetitive some times, or you can skip it rightly by doing nothing but\u00a0sleeping every day and reaching a bad end.<br/></p>\n<p>If you take time to download and play, please let me know your\u00a0thoughts\u00a0about it, any kind of feedback is really apreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T13:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f7922b770c78a7372a321cd92511622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sipsop"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
