As triangles fall from the top of the screen, \n      rotate them to group six panels of the same color and create a matching \n      hexagon (HEX). Once the HEX has been formed, it will disappear, allowing \n      the existing panels to shift and more to fill the playing field. Two \n      different styles of intuitive controls and the clear-cut goal allow you \n      to focus solely on the game play\u2014which is vital, as the playing field \n      will be full of panels before you know it. With multiple modes available \n      (unlock more as you progress farther in SOLO mode), special item panels \n      at your disposal, and the ability to play cooperatively or competitively \n      with a friend, there will always be another HEX to create!\n    </p><p>\n      Check out more Art Style games! <br/>For WiiWare: <br/>Art \n      Style: CUBELLO <br/>Art \n      Style: light trax<br/>Art \n      Style: ORBIENT<br/>Art \n      Style: Rotozoa\n    </p><p>\n      For DSiWare: <br/>Art \n      Style: AQUIA<br/>Art \n      Style: BOXLIFE<br/>Art \n      Style: DIGIDRIVE<br/>Art \n      Style: BASE 10<br/>Art \n      Style: precipice<br/>Art \n      Style: Zengage<br/>Art \n      Style: PiCTOBiTS\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/943a0b312eb1e4ccc5858d9c417bd714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
