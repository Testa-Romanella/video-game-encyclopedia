That means that fighters will choose random targets to attack without coordinating with each other at all, and healers will choose random targets to heal and might try to heal someone who is at full health instead of your mage who is one hit away from death.</p>\n<p>As chaotic as it sounds, you might find it addicting using your practice and understanding to\u00a0direct your fate, planning your team composition and timing your special abilities. But it's only a matter of time until a string of bad luck wipes it all away!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5cdd8094e5085c70ef6b9f24d0fea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sicilica"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
