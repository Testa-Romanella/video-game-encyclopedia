{"id": 815656, "slug": "proton-power-pinball-demo", "name": "Proton Power Pinball [Demo]", "name_original": "Proton Power Pinball [Demo]", "description": "<p>With a jam-packed soundtrack and dynamic playfield toys, the demo to the cancelled <em>Proton Power Pinball</em> is finally playable!<br/></p>\n<p>From the playfield and backglass art to the authentic chiptune soundtrack, <em>PPP </em>is styled after a 90's (post-<em>Addams Family</em>) pinball table. The left ramp features a <em><strong>Wario Land</strong></em><strong> bucket toy </strong>which players can fill with balls. After two balls are in, the bucket releases a shower of balls to begin Multiball. Players can start <strong>Modes </strong>by <strong>breaking the fortune cookie toy</strong> in the back.  Modes have instructions on the DMD indicating where to shoot the ball, and when all five Modes are complete, <strong>Wizard Mode</strong> begins, playing <em>Unbreakable Determination</em> from <em>Ninja Gaiden.<br/></em></p>\n<p>Speaking of the<strong> music selection</strong>, original VRC7 arrangements of songs from games\u00a0(and even one film!) join remixes of <strong>Popskyy's \"Initialize\"</strong> and <strong>\"Farewell Friends\"</strong> to represent the history of ProtonJon's streams and online entertainment. The game features a <strong>Sound Test</strong> where players can listen to over 20 songs and jingles.<br/></p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>PPP</em> soundtrack is available here: https://jonso.bandcamp.com/album/proton-power-pinball-ost-to-cancelled-game<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the development was done in 2020, though some work has been done since to release it in a playable state. I chose to cancel this project due to <strong>various physics glitches</strong> and due to the<strong> amount of work</strong> needed to <strong>complete the DMD animations</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, I chose to release this project in this state so that the work would not go to waste, and to bring closure to something that otherwise would not see the light of day.<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>NOTES:<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Many pieces of music do not play in-game, only in the Sound Test.<br/></strong><ul><li><strong>For example. Ace of Spades 64 will not play in-game.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>If you choose to play, I strongly recommend using the debug keys (2QWE</strong>)\u00a0<strong>to move the ball, especially when it gets stuck.</strong></li><li><strong>XBOX 360 Controllers are supported, though other controllers are not guaranteed to work.</strong></li><li><strong>\"Wario Video Mode\" is non-functional, though it would have been a recreation of the Left/Right Bucket minigame from <em>Wario Land</em>.<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Wizard Mode (when <em>Unbreakable Determination</em> from <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> plays) does not do anything.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n\n<p>--FONTS--</p>\n<p>M04 Fatal Fury by Miffies; mfs.jp.org https://www.dafont.com/m04fatal-fury.font</p>\n<p>M12 Match Biker by Miffies; https://www.dafont.com/m12-match-biker.font</p>\n<p>Retron 2000 by Daymarius; https://www.dafont.com/retron2000.font</p>\n<p>Silkscreen by Jason Aleksandr Kottke; https://www.dafont.com/silkscreen.font</p>\n<p>Pixeled by OmegaPC777; https://www.dafont.com/pixeled.font</p>\n<p>Hannover Messe by Chequered Ink</p>\n<p>--SFX--</p>\n<p>Superman (N64) by Cooper B.
