{"id": 139145, "slug": "code-red-ii", "name": "Code Red II", "name_original": "Code Red II", "description": "<p>My entry for the A Game By Its Cover 2017 game jam, and inspired by the Famicase entry by Tek-Man (Patrick Gordon).<br/></p>\n<p>This is a top down shooter with tank based movement that is basically a single boss battle. Very simple. I do consider this a complete project however, and the updates will most likely only be bug fixes.</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is built on top my implementation of the top down shooter in Sebastian Lague's Unity Create a Game Tutorial Series that I completed roughly 3 months prior to the start of the #AGBIC game jam and have since worked on in the hopes of making a complete game right up until I discovered the game jam. The source code with the full commit history is available on github.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also uses a few free to use 3rd party assets, mainly sound effects and music. Details can be found in the readme file.<br/></p>\r\nMoveWASDAimMouseShoot Cannon<br/>Right Click<br/>Shoot Machine Gun<br/>Left Click<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/12039ad103b8a51c0b14d9ef082de724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noc7c9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
