GGJ page:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/avoid-7</p><p>After a catastrophic event leaves you stranded in space surrounded by debris in the darkness, you will need to use your head to navigate the hazards of the wreckage and find your way to a comms terminal to call for help. The gameplay is really simple: The character can look around and move in the direction they are looking at, but there's a catch. You can only move by using limited propulsion bursts that are enough to sen you floating through endless space to your eventual demise, so be careful. Use the environment around you to plan your escape route. Look out for burst refills, they are essential to help you on your journey. Beware of harmful debris around you, as they can bring you ever closer to your doom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f05004c5d1da9f4a5bb710085d67c9b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rodrigo Villani"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
