If you take too much damage in the process we will have to reset the timeline. Will you succeed? The world wonders...</p>\n<p>Use Arrow Keys or WASD to drive and SPACE to jump time streams. The longer you spend in a time stream the stronger the signal will get but both need to be aligned for you to go home. The signal strength indicators are in the top right and slowly grow as you gain signal strength then turn green when that stream is at full strength. When you leave a stream the signal strength will slowly degrade.\u00a0Get both indicators to green to complete your mission.</p>\n<p>Made for #extragamejam and #kenneyjam 2018</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong><br/>Kenny Assets<br/>https://kenney.nl/assets</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>\"Reformat\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Engine</strong><br/>Created in Phaser\u00a0<br/>https://phaser.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/235f0913d1fcf2bd1a745a4e1dda5f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["n00begon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
