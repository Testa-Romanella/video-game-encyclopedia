Followed by his alien assistant, Mendel, and using his amazing skill of relation deducing, he solves various cases in order to fix broken families.\u00a0There are 5 cases to solve, aliens are randomly generated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The core idea: aliens have certain properties (leg count, eye count, colors\u2026), there are specific rules of inheritance for each of these properties. Your task, as a detective, is to find a certain alien within a given group, using these rules. It might be a long-lost children, elderly parents or step-brother.</p>\n<p>I could not resist and instead of making a simple game, I made it too complicated\u2026 I had fun, might be fun for you as well, if you have patience to get familiar with the rules.</p>\n<p>As pointed out by smart players, evolution does not work by making averages (as suggested in the game), instead selects one parent to inherit the traits :D</p>\n<p>This game was created in less than 24 hours during Ludum Dare #24 compo \u2013 the theme was \u201cEvolution\u201c. The game ranked #50 of 1006 games in Innovation and #36 in Humor category.<br/><br/>Date: 08/2012<br/>Tools: vim, haXe, GIMP, sfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/32008854f3e7d59f12b2cca5799f1192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarnik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
