Well, I am  the one to find it. You just ask, I will go back there and try to...  Damn, you didn't ask for this pill, did you? I should probably consume  it before the inspector comes around... Why is everything purple now?\r\n </p>\n<p>This game was created for fun as part of the third Bevy Jam: https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3. The theme of the jam is side effects. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nA word of caution\r\n<p>This game (obviously) has no official age rating. Be warned that it might contain the following:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Dark humour\r\n</li><li>Drug and violence references (text only - no graphic violence)</li><li>Immature humour</li></ul>\n<p>I understand that the above might not be funny to everyone, so I decided to make it clear from the beginning.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>This is a goofy game of memory. Sort of. Orders arrive,  and you try to service them by remembering where that stupid little  thing is hiding. You just have to click a box. Clicking a box swaps it with the first box, and then opens it. If you guess wrong, get  ready for the consequences! If your guess is correct, you get your money, the customer leaves, and maybe nothing shady happens afterwards. Maybe.<br/></p>\n<p>In the beginning, contents of all boxes are unknown. If you have a good memory, you might be able to figure out the contents of boxes as the game progresses. If not, don't worry; the game was designed to be funny, thus you cannot die (but you might kill some of your customers).</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<p>https://github.com/softsilverwind/junkmart/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0d1cb26f7dfc87b2258c4b67ffe533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["softsilverwind"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
