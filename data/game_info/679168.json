Tested on Firefox and Chrome.<br/></strong></p><p>Run through the gates to light up the lanterns on them, if you miss too many gates it will get gradually dark and running becomes just...shot in the dark.\u00a0 Lightning up the lanterns will drive \u00a0the darkness away. Gather up shinies for points, one shinie gives you 100 points, running through the gate gives 10 points. It likewise makes you go a bit faster and faster. So you must decide if you want more light that also gives you speed, or run in a darkness but run slower. Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Simple endless runner to test out some assets and fool around with simple scripts.
