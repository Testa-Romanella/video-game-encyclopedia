During this ambitious foray, Cadaver decided to go even bigger and the graphic novel also evolved into an interactive experience that is sure to engage audiences worldwide.     <br/><br/>Davey believes that story and character are two of the most important elements to an enjoyable game and it's apparent with <strong>AN IOU</strong> because the two protagonists are not only relatable, they feel like real people that you've known your entire life. <br/>My only complaint is that I wish the game were longer because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Trevor &amp; Mallory!  <br/> <br/><strong>AN IOU</strong> is the culmination of years of work and is obviously filled to the brim with passion, dedication, and creativity. This is one of the best games I have ever played by a solo game developer and Davey Cadaver has definitely left his mark on the visual novel community. <br/>I can't wait to see what the future holds for him &amp; for those of us eager to play his next release.\"  <br/><br/>-Scott Elster<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up. <br/>May contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T03:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f5caf74cbebb8c8565e01cdfc02fe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Room Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Room Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
