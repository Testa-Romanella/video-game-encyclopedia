I'm going to completely patch this issue after the rating period is over.<br/></p>\n<p>Tenebris is a platformer with 8 levels, based on exploration and trial &amp; error. Made in 3 days as a\u00a0submission to Wowie Jam 3.0, for which the theme was \"FAILURE IS PROGRESS\".</p>\n<p>You, Boy Blob, were taking a stroll in the dark forest with Girl Blob\u00a0one day,\u00a0when you suddenly made a wrong turn and got lost. The forest is full of obstacles and suspended platforms you can't see. As you walk, you will light up the area around you, but if you want to make it to the end of each zone, you'll have to fail sometimes to identify the obstacles and learn more about the level in order to progress.</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me within the submission frame (other than a few lines of code). I used Unity, Piskel, Bfxr, Audacity, and Beepbox to develop the game.<br/>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/53053f12166206d8bff607647207f8ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NotEuclid"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
