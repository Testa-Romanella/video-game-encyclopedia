It's pretty basic. You just have to <strong>press A, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT and UP with a proper timing</strong> and that's it. You'll reach the end in 2 minutes even if you miss all the notes.<br/></p>\n<p>In fact, I chose to make a rhythm game just because I wanted to face all the difficulties that come with audio synchronisation. That's not something that I would have attempted in a shorter game jam, so... it felt like the right time.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, this was the occasion for me  to try and use a music composition tool for the very first time. I have zero knowledge in this field, so I had a hell of a time making sense of the musical lingo I found on the internet. But  I came up with some remixes on my own anyway, which - I hope - don't sound too bad. <br/>I'm kinda proud of that.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6ddf713c6ca90947f211f1bdd2581bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nui"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
