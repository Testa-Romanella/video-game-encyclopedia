The adress leads to an old abandoned castle. Since nobody is home, you just leave them a notification and get back to your car, when you suddenly crash through the floor and are trapped below the castle. <strong>Time to find a way out of here and finally get home!</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Gather different abilities to help you escape!</li><li>Collect optional shiny gems scattered around the castle!</li><li>Complete the game as fast as you can and compare your time with your friends!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Note: If the sound is not working, please check the sound output device of your PC. Sometimes the PC switches its output to the gamepad speakers when connecting the gamepad.<br/></strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Playing with a gamepad is recommended, although playing with a keyboard works as well.</p>\n<p><strong>The browser version currently only works properly with a PS5 Gamepad or a keyboard! For other gamepads the controls are unfortunately mixed up, although they should still work, you'll just have to figure out the correct buttons.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The downloadable Windows version should work fine with all input methods. Only the pause button and menu navigation seem to require a keyboard here</strong><br/></p>\r\nPS Gamepad\r\n<ul><li><strong>Movement:</strong>\u00a0Left\u00a0Joystick</li><li><strong>Jump: </strong>X</li><li><strong>Interact: </strong>Square</li><li><strong>Inventory/Pause: </strong>Options</li><li><strong>Close Textbox: </strong>Circle</li></ul>\r\nXBox Gamepad\r\n<ul><li><strong>Movement:</strong>\u00a0Left\u00a0Joystick<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Jump: </strong>A</li><li><strong>Interact: </strong>X</li><li><strong>Inventory/Pause: </strong>Start</li><li><strong>Close Textbox: </strong>B</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul><li><strong>Movement:</strong> Arrow Keys<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Jump: </strong>Space\r\n</li><li><strong>Interact:\u00a0</strong>E</li><li><strong>Inventory/Pause: </strong>Escape\r\n</li><li><strong>Close Textbox: </strong>R</li></ul>\n<br/><strong>The buttons for the different unlockable abilities can be seen anytime by opening the inventory (PS Gamepad and Keyboard).</strong>\n\r\nSpeedrun Developer Times\r\n<p><strong>Any %: </strong>3:17</p>\n<p><strong>100%:\u00a0</strong>5:40</p>\n<p>In the Any% Speedrun players just need to finish the game in the fastest way possible.

Also both keys have to be used on their respective doors.</p>\r\nVersions\r\n<p>The only difference between v1.0.1 and v1.1 is the input system. <br/></p>\n<p>v1.0.1 is identical to the browser version and recommended when using a PS5 gamepad or a keyboard.</p>\n<p>v1.1 should (hopefully) work with any gamepad. The only problem with this version is that pausing the game/opening the inventory and menu navigation require the keyboard.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>The game was inpired by Squid God's Playdate-Microvania \"The King's Dungeon\": https://squidgod.itch.io/the-kings-dungeon</li><li>Character inspired by Dani Maccari: https://dani-maccari.itch.io/1bit-platformer-doungeoun</li><li>Font by Tiny Worlds:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059</li><li>Music by Florian Stracker: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/electronic/retro-fit-adventure...</li><li>SFX by Leohpaz: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/rpg-essentials-sound-effect...</li><li>SFX by GrumpyDiamondAssets: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/retro-game-sfx-60365#conten...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d93566f1ca1511fbffcb51a7ee53820.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Ulbo Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
