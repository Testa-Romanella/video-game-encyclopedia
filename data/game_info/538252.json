Some train will come out periodily, and have difference destination. You have to make sure all of them go to the correct place, without going out of place by whether derailed (failed to switch the railway) or bump into other train.</p>\n<p>Easy to control, just left click the cross.</p>\n<p>(But actually game over is not implement. When derailed it would just stuck there, and I don't even know what would happens when two trains meet.)</p>\n<p>credit: low poly arts from Synty Store,\u00a0specifically Prototype Pack and Adventure Pack.</p>\n<p>I will finish the demo at a later time. I really like this idea, and hope you guys and girls can give me some feedback, whatever positive or nagative. Thanks in advance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4ea32a5705cb9f59d0e554f9569b431a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["colin0154"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
