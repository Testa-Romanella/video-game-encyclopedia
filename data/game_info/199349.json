May add colliders to each of the fingers in order to pick up and grasp objects.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>-------------------------------</em></p>\n<p>Used Autodesk Maya to model, UV map, and rig contraction animations for each finger. Overall a fun process! Going into the exercise, I had no idea how avatar masks worked; however, I had read posts online and on youtube in regards to more than one animation playing at a time.\u00a0<br/><br/>Using Unity's official tutorials and reading user tutorials online, I was able to finger out how to manipulate joint transforms using avatar masks. What this translates to is the ability for more than one finger to contract at a time in the hand! You can do finger rolls (Q -&gt; W -&gt; E -&gt; R) and even throw up the horns (W + E).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle was wrapping my head around the idea of using more than one avatar mask. Previously I had tried to fit all the relevant transitions (to get more than one finger to contract at a time) in one animation layer by playing around with bool values in the script. This looked something like:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- if press q, then play index finger animation<br/>-from that state, if the user presses w, then play w</p>\n<p>I was quickly met with a wonky response in which the two animations would play simultaneously for a short amount of time; then one would abruptly finish. I was also unable to \"wiggle\" fingers. Long story short, creating a single animation layer was not the option.</p>\n<p>The solution in this case? I'm not entirely certain it was the optimal route; however, I ended up creating 4 separate avatar masks and 4 separate animation layers for the index/middle/ring/pinky fingers. Allocated the proper transform constraints, attached the masks to the correct layers, then bumped up the weight for each to the max!\u00a0<br/><br/>The result was responsive finger contractions that I am absolutely happy with.<br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this!<br/></p>\n<p>Best,<br/>May<br/>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344446d8a40c07e0a75e696a68dc4646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maynard santos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
