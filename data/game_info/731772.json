The evil chickens have taken all of the fish! Go, brave penguin, go! Use your magic to fight against evil and restore the peace fish!</em><br/></strong>\n<p>This is a short 3D action platformer with a voxel aesthetic, where you play as a penguin and can use three kinds of magic (fire, ice and thunder). Gather the magic books scattered across the map to recharge your magic power, and find the three keys so you can reach the final boss, the <strong>Giant Chicken</strong>, and beat it<strong>. </strong>You only have ten minutes to do it, so there's no time to waste!</p>\n<p>(also, you might want to set some trees on fire, just because)<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a prototype made in three weeks as a class project for the Unity programming course at CIFO L'Hospistalet, so don't expect a really polished gameplay experience, but I'm proud enough of it to share it! Made in Unity 2019.</p>\n<p>All assets, except for some textures, are free to use assets or taken from the Unity Asset Store.
