{"id": 300860, "slug": "egg-factor", "name": "Egg Factor", "name_original": "Egg Factor", "description": "Egg Factor is a unique, fun, logic-based puzzle game that progresses through 25 evermore fiendish levels.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to fill all four nests with eggs by using the arrows on the board to direct an egg into a nest.<br/><br/>To play, you simply tap on an arrow and the entire row moves in the direction of the arrow. When an arrow scrolls off the edge of the board it reappears on the opposite side. The egg cannot scroll off the board's sides or top, only into a vacant nest.<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple enough for children, but later levels are cunningly designed to challenge even the best players.<br/><br/>You have a limited number of moves to complete each level. There is also a World Record for each level that you can try to match, or even surpass. <br/><br/>You can optionally purchase extra moves within the game to get you through the tougher levels. <br/><br/>Can you beat level 25?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418dc6568aba335c7d965038d1652014_LhVmkoy.jpg", "website": "http://www.eggfactor.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Perrins"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Paul Perrins"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
