Meanwhile, as the fabric of space time breaks down with the overproduction of multiverse movies- other Carls are coming to our Earth to help fight for the BPRA!</p>\r\n-CONTROLS-\r\n<p>Move in Menu: Arrow Keys.</p>\n<p>Select/Advance: Z</p>\n<p>More about Build Public Renewables: New York State has a goal of achieving 70% wind + solar by 2030, but has no current PLAN in place to reach that goal.
