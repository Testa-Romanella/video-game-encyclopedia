A separate 'reverse' button flipped the ship's direction. In this version, the right-key is thrust and the left-key is used for the reverse button, which might take some getting used to, but gives a more authentic experience. Think of up/down/right for moving your ship along and treat the left-key separately, for the occasional direction flip.</p>\n<p>For hyperspace, press up and down together and then press the smart bomb key.</p>\n<p>To stop the screen flashing during effects and turn off the rapid colour cycling, go to the pause menu and use the \"toggle flashing\" option.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Code: Greg Gaughan</p>\n<p>Audio: Martha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00cbb837b4d568e621bb62d9793131c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ggaughan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
