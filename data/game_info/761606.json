I was 5 then, when I decided that I wanted to make games, almost 40 years later I have always been involved with the game industry and decided to make my first game. This is it! Defendor! An Arcade game with solid arcade gameplay with the most basic mechanics I could think off.<br/><br/>Not lying here.. I took gameplay inspiration from a lot of 80s game as well as some new, like bitblaster XL. Love that game!<br/>But I added mechanics that were not available back then. If the game is arcadey, then there is the other side of the base. After each run you can spend your stars in your base to improve you ship capabilities like unlocking new weapons and survivability options.<br/>Survive the time needed to save the base inhabitants before its inevitable destruction.<br/><br/>If you bought the game... thank you. It means more to me than you can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>~ Tiago Costa - almostApixel<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Your ship is always moving and shooting, you may turn left or right<br/></li><li>Your ship is always shooting and ammo is finite, shoot enemies to increase ammo<br/></li><li>Gather Stars to upgrade the base and unlock new weapons and ships<br/></li><li>Survive enough time for the escape ship to flee</li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Retro style CRT effects for extra nostalgia punch in the gut<br/></li><li>Music by DOS-88<br/></li><li>All game in one screen, that will expand with time<br/></li><li>Small color palette, blue, darker blue, yellow, darker yellow, white and black (and some red to throw people off)<br/></li><li>Weapon variety like triple shot, missile, bomb trail, lasers and more<br/></li><li>Several ships to choose from<br/></li><li>Drone weapons to support your ship<br/></li><li>Keyboard + Basic Controller Support<br/></li><li>Languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish, more soon...<br/></li><li>Stupidly fun!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:09:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab160645bfbbd42f765b3324cd13dad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["almostApixel", "jonrekXD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["almostApixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
