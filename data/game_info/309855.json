{"id": 309855, "slug": "i-ride-a-scooter", "name": "I ride a Scooter", "name_original": "I ride a Scooter", "description": "You are hired by a local grocery store in a newly developed seaside town to do deliveries, <br/>\r\nrun errands and take on various roles on a fully functional motorized Scooter. <br/>\r\nYou will be asked to complete jobs as simple as gathering fruits up a tree to bring back to the store, or climbing a mountain to interact with an animal, to simply throwing magazines at the doorstep of local stores/residents. No two jobs are the same. Expect to ride through traffic, climb the mountain range, enter buildings, interact with animals, hop on/off the Scooter via teleport and more all while listening to the radio. This is just the beginning of your new life in VR.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOVERVIEW:<br/>\r\n. Total control of Scooter : Accelerate at your speed, steer freely, hop on/off bike via teleport<br/>\r\n. Music player to enjoy while you work around town on your Scooter<br/>\r\n. You can enter some buildings, you can climb certain parts of the mountain<br/>\r\n. Interaction with the animal kingdom in a living seaside town<br/>\r\n. Relaxing setting when combining riding, picking your music and interacting in a living town<br/>\r\n. Be watchful for angry cab drivers and falling from height, as both will get you killed<br/>\r\n. VR sickness kept to minimum : gas/turn as slowly as you want, reduced FOV when riding<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFUTURE PLANS:<br/>\r\n. Player having to put gas into bike at gas station<br/>\r\n. More parts of the mountain region will be accessible/climbable<br/>\r\n. More buildings to enter <br/>\r\n. Another city or a forest island nearby for the new missions<br/>\r\n. More animals and/or people interaction<br/>\r\n. Lots more to come", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/662e921947ce8d05a43f36271779ea87.jpg", "website": "http://www.kirtonvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KirtonVR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KirtonVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
