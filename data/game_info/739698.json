The game is set in high school in an alternate universe at the end of the world. Visual tropes from anime, videogames and early 2000\u2019s digital culture are referenced and remixed to evoke nostalgia and further allegorize the uniquely Millennial adolescent experience of apathy, desensitization, and confusion caused by first-generation internet addiction and media oversaturation. A binary dialogue decision-making gameplay expresses the protagonist\u2019s struggles with intrusive thoughts and managing impulsivity.  This character-driven gameplay also explores group dynamics, relationships, morality, sexuality, consent, and manipulation. The soundtrack is original, written and performed by the developer Lena NW.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fef0dbd10e6fde8a11e00ceafdd8ea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
