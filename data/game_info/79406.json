Each level demands a different color of gemstone! Drag your finger across unwanted gems and they will shatter, leaving the good ones to fall into place. Stack them for big combos and big points! Watch for special items as well; touching a \"B\" symbol will destroy all gems of the same color that you touched. Touching a \"C\" symbol will convert gems of the color you touched into the color for that level!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef95fa0641210e421a8bcfca51ac4b98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Scott Cawthon"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Scott Cawthon"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
