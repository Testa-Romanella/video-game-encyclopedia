They prevent the player from finding the portal key, they can attack\u00a0the player, and cause the player's health to be deducted. The player needs to explore the map, find the key to open the portal, and escape to the next level.</p>\n<p>In addition to shooting, the game levels of this game also add some puzzle elements. The player needs to think and solve the puzzles to find the portal key. This kind of gameplay can increase the difficulty of the game level and increase the playability of the game.
