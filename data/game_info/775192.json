This makes me think of the mechanic of a tech tree with different upgrades that you can buy. My idea was to strip everything but this mechanic. The hero has a gun and uses it to shoot at a horde of monsters. You have the choice between three upgrades that will modify the weapon statistic of the hero. How long can you help him survive by creating the best weapon?</p>\n<p>How to play?<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Choose with your mouse the next upgrade du buy and click to buy it\r\n</li><li>You can check how the stats of the weapon change on the top left corner\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Huge thanks to\u00a0@abstrkt for the music! Please go check what he does on\u00a0his website. \r\n</p>\n<p>Created\u00a0in ~12h. I had a base of gameplay after 4-5 hours and since I was overtime I took the time to polish it a bit. I did it in C/C++ without a proper engine. I used SFML2 to leverage most of the rendering, audio, and controls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T08:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c171fead810618f5ed77884a58fed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KinoxKlark", "abstrkt"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
