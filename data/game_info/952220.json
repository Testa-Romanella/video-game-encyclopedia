Also, the full ruleset is only 23 pages long (at the moment), which is also not standart for the most games)</p>\n<p> Any feedback, comments, ideas, repost or coverage on the internet, would be appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e9089b9df0386fc1ffec24f2947bb1ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HasturUdjat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
