It is based on \"Cities and Desire 5\", from \u201cInvisible Cities\u201d by Italo Calvino. This city is a dangerous city built by creatures driven by lust and beauty, and each night they patrol the city's premises for intruders. You must help the player to cross the city. The player does not have weapons; hence she cannot fight or cause damage to the creatures. She can only run, jump, and scream. To avoid getting caught, she must hide or distract enemies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name: Tahsin Tabassum Rahman Oishi\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lab 01</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c6039b2896bdf43df5dadf5d279cf17c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tahsintr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
