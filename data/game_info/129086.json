This was a difficult theme to pull off, since how can there really be genres that are incompatible in this day and age of creativity? It also didn't help that I was away and unable to work on a game for the first day of the jam.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I carried on. I figured combining a vertical shmup (a genre with constant movement and fast reflexes) with a board game format (where there would be more strategy and patience) would be my idea.<br/><br/>## HOW TO PLAY</p>\n\n<p>The game is built for five players: Four players take the role of the ships and one takes the role of an enemy controller.</p>\n<p>1. The ship rolls the dice twice, the number one to six determines how many moves and bullets will be shot (0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3).<br/>2. Choose to move (M key) or shoot (S key) first (ships cannot move and shoot at the same time).<br/>3. Any bullet that hits an enemy will damage it. Enemy ships that lose all health get destroyed.<br/>4. Repeat for each ship.<br/>5. The enemy controller will receive cards, these cards determine how many moves, shots to fire and new enemies to place.<br/>6. Click on enemy ships to move or shoot. Click on an empty space in the first five rows to place an enemy.<br/>7. If enemy receives a boss card, the controller has up to ten turns to summon the final boss.</p>\n<p>* Each ship's goal is to defeat the boss ship before any other ship does.</p>\n<p>* The enemy's goal is to defeat all of the ships.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b7ab119e1e3c53d0e447a396c0d6c2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
