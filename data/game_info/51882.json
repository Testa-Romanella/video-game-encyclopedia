Unbeknownst to her, a deranged stalker harbors a dangerous infatuation with Cas, leading to a series of threatening letters and a deadly game of survival.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the player receives letters that reveal her stalker's twisted perception of affection and his increasing desperation to possess Cas.<br/><br/>Letters written to Cas by her stalker include disturbing messages written to real women, collected by the developer through multiple surveys. As such, the content in the game may be disturbing to read and experience. Those who are triggered by mentions of assault should not play.<br/><br/>\"Stay\" aims to simulate a PSX survival horror game, utilizing stationary 3rd person cameras and tank controls (the way it's meant to be played) and is intended to be played with a controller. The option to play with a dynamic camera exists, but should be a last resort. <br/><br/>You can stealth and hide through it, or collect weapons to fight back, it's up to you.
