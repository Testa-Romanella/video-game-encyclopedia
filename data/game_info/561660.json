Please comment/review and I will be sure to return a review\r\n\r\nDad and G's Trip to Candyland\r\n<p>All they wanted to do was give mom a break and get some candy. On their way to Candyland they were separated and now need to find each other and still get to Candyland.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made with the help of my 5 year old\u00a0daughter G. We sat down and game up with the ideas together. All the art was approved by her and the monsters were drawn by her. We hope you enjoy playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/1251fc1b965ba4f0b51f81a3f44b5843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LIGDMike"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
