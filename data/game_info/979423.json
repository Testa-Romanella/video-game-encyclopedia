{"id": 979423, "slug": "sealed-in-wax", "name": "Sealed in Wax", "name_original": "Sealed in Wax", "description": "This isn't your grandpa's roguelite, deckbuilding, card game. That's right, Sealed in Wax isn't even a roguelite. What you're looking at is 40+ levels with <strong>NO</strong> randomization and <strong>NO</strong> starting over. These levels have been handcrafted with care and are brought straight farm to table for your enjoyment.<br/><br/>Remember back in the good ol' days when you would buy a game, play through its levels once, then move on with your life? Well here you go pal, this one's just for you. Infinite replayability? I don't think so. Spend a few hours and send all these levels to the shadow realm.<br/><br/>How does it play? Your nameless hero faces off against a series of big baddies that have escaped from the aptly, and quite blandly, named Tome of Magic. You take on the role of the puppet master to play monster cards for your hero to fight and reward cards to power up your hero. At the end of the level, your hero squares up to take on the big baddy directly. Should you succeed to seal the big baddy back into the Tome of Magic, enjoy the plunder of your victory in the form of newly unlocked cards. You are free to tweak your deck to your heart's content between levels.<br/><br/>Finish the game? Sit back, pat yourself on the back, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment of having beaten Sealed in Wax.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T08:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fccb1fa97932b2b8843e8c56673f2013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raven Blue Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raven Blue Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
