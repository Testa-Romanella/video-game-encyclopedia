An eight-person team first spent two weeks in Los Angeles, California, touring buildings, museums, parks, and sites of significance. The team then returned to spend two weeks on campus, with the challenge of creating a project that was inspired by what they experienced and researched in California. Each team consisted of Entertainment, Interior, and Game Design students, creating projects under the direction of Dave Beck as the class instructor. <br/></p>\n<p>The team responsible for Wisteria included:</p>\n<p>Derek Brown - Animation</p>\n<p>Nicole Fairchild - Game Design</p>\n<p>Mary Flaherty - Game Design and Entertainment Design</p>\n<p>Josh Frederick - Game Design</p>\n<p>Jenn Seibert - Game Design</p>\n<p>Alaina Sieben - Interior Design</p>\n<p>Madeline Spain - Interior Design</p>\n<p>Jesse Vaselaar - Animation</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve come upon a manor that appears to be abandoned. The house is in ruins and overgrowth of plant life and crumbling walls have blocked much of the view of the center-stage courtyard. After exploring the rooms, you find yourself at the top of a tower. Making your way onto the balcony, you notice a set of staircases leading to the courtyard and climb down. After exploring the area, you notice something you didn\u2019t see before\u2026 a grave. Your surroundings fade from view.</p>\n<p>The game was inspired primarily by the following locations:</p>\n<p>Hollyhock House</p>\n<p>Adamson House</p>\n<p>Getty Villa</p>\n<p>Mission San Juan Capistrano</p>\n<p>Autry Museum of the American West</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffb20b648cca6519363b07f651bea668.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TFB Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
