Score points given by opening blocks with mines near them.</p>\r\nTo move to layer bellow you should open this block.\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDigits over blocks indicate how many mines around them, not counting them itself. So under zero can be mine.\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<p>- Reduced chance of instafail on first step</p>\n<p>- Refactoring with making more modern raycast. Maybe fixed something, maybe broken something. Wanted to fix another instafail bug. Mirrored digits over blocks.</p>\n<p>- Moved arrow one block higher, so now it's visible. Increased box around arrow too.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb93df077050d286536c069191b3c698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Morricore"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
