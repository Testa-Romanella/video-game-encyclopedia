Play fast, play smart, or you'll literally <strong><em>run out of controls!<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>In the game you must direct one or more cars to a finish-tile. You can manipulate the level using control-modifiers. So it's quite easy? Oh no! We made sure you never have enough modifiers to finish a level up-front ;) You have to switch modifiers around while the cars drive, and really think ahead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made for the GMTK 2020 gamejam, with the theme 'Out of control.' </strong></p>\n<p>Created by: Steven Kuperus (Virtual Turtle Games) and Thomas Rebel (Pengon.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>* Unfortunately the dragging of modifiers can be a bit buggy.
