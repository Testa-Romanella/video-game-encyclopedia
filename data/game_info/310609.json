It is a multiplayer top down style arena shooter in the vain of Subspace. Currently it is still pretty basic but i am trying to do weekly updates with new features and bug fixes. As it is a multiplayer game i need a number of players on together at the same time. So please invite friends to play also.</p>\n<p>The game features multiple ship chassis that can be outfitted with different weapons and equipment. Again right now selections in game are pretty limited but i hope to be adding much more. Eventually ships and equipment will have to be unlocked or earned to use in some game modes, but for now everything in game is usable.</p>\n<p>The game uses an auto patcher and a basic account system for saving user data. As i don't yet have a privacy notice in game yet please rest assured the game does not collect any info from the user other than game related data (username, scores etc). The account creation requires an email address to activate the account, i do this to help reduce account creation abuse. I do apologize for the inconvenience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/58138613636c30971bdaacf2d04963b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justplain Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
