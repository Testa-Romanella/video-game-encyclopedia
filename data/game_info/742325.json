So i went with\u00a0the\u00a0overload is overloading player with the things to control(3 characters). I\u00a0 also tried to balance the game, while trying to do chaotic mechanics.</p>\n<p>And a few tips: The game has\u00a0random, but you can play around it(there is random chance of you getting 4 random particles out of 1).\u00a0You can break incoming particles(except for sword) with\u00a0pretty muchanything, but you want to collect the arrows, \u00a0and\u00a0the warrior is good for collecting arrows, not only he can collect arrows with a tip of his sword(you need to hit with it first), but also\u00a0the mage can heal him, if his health is lower than 2. The archer is your only way to attack the boss. The boss has 3 phases after he has 15hp and\u00a0 10hp left. Also the fireballs can heal him. There is a certain strategy required to win, so have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:44:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bdb657e5a610baad37ed994cc970bcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coffeetest1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
