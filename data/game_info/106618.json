The initial terrain is generated with a diamond square algorithm (for the bedrock) and Perlin noise (for the sand). The water erodes the sand, weathering the terrain. Different levels of rain and sunlight affect the water cycle, adding rainwater and evaporating the existing water. Boids flock above the waves.</p><p>Press the spacebar to get a new world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b26bab474c552188ebe7a176cef8c87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ikarth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
