To maximize damage, it is best to be facing your enemies directly before pressing the right &amp;quot;Weapons/Fire&amp;quot; button. Holding the left &amp;quot;Shield&amp;quot; button will allow you to deflect all enemy projectiles. Prolonged use of the Weapons/Shields will cause a temporary overload. Note that it is NOT possible to fire your weapons while Shields are active until you level-up your starship and unlock Translucent Shielding at Level 5.<br/><br/>In addition, completing missions, earning XP and leveling-up your ship to Level 5 will also unlock new playable spacecraft for FREE. You may also skip the RPG grind and instantly level-up via the use of optional In-App Purchases. Each In-App Purchase can also be Restored, thus allowing you to instantly unlock playable ships on multiple iOS devices.<br/><br/>YouTube game play trailer: http://youtu.be/wpAzofgjmKE", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f99e0ad9a9577c0cce086c804ff24d5.jpeg", "website": "http://milesgodspeed.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Miles Godspeed"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Miles Godspeed"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
