The theme of the jam was \"Hide or die\" and\u00a0for this game, we went for the style of an old 90s point and click adventure. The game is fairly short, as you can only add so much to a linear game like this one in a game jam. Me and my partner, Esnix, had a lot of fun taking pictures and making music for the game, and we hope you enjoy playing it!</p>\n\n<p>Hide from the entity that's looking for you. If you don't find an escape fast enough, he'll take you. Everywhere you go is a gamble on your life.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming, SFX &amp; Photography: Troglodev</p>\n<p>Soundtrack &amp; other audio engineering: Esnix</p>\n<p>(Free assets were also used.)</p>\n<p>Made with Godot, with love.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ec5c509652a76848477713cae91d235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sundown Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
