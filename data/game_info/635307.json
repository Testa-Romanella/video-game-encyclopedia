Awaken the soul of a foolish adventurer, of a humble servant or an untimely guest to try and earn back your freedom.

Look out for beguiling traps, secret treasures and snarky ghosts!<h3>Relics and Weapons, and Spirits \u2014 oh my!</h3><br/>But do not fret - ancient relics, as old as the bones beneath your feet, will help you on your journey and might just give you the edge you need to succeed.<br/><br/>And should you happen upon a kindred spirit, try and help \u2014 you might be surprised by the result.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T03:33:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07ef99abe22bfd72ddafd04c047dfac6.jpg", "website": "https://arx.bg/spirit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ARX Media"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ARX Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
