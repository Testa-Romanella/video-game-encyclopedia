The number you swiped disappears and numbers above it fall down. Combine 9s for big points!!!</p>\n<p>It's a simple to learn, yet addictive\u00a0game that will get you hooked for just one more round!</p>\n<p>There are two playable modes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Moves - score as many points as possible in 30 moves.\r\n</li><li>Timed - score as many points as possible in 60 seconds.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Numerology is intended to be a hypercasual game, so mobile version is a most. I will be working on this in the near future. You can already play it on a tablet or touch-enabled laptop using the HTML5 export.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaderboard</strong></p>\n<p>Numerology includes a global online leaderboard for both game modes! Try to beat the highscores there. Some of those were set during ScoreSpace #12 Jam.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>The current version is 1.2.0, you can check the itch.io devlog for updates.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for ScoreSpace #12 Jam and the original release (1.0 and updates up to 1.2.0)\u00a0were uploaded to the ScoreSpace #12 page in gamejam.com. Note that further updates are only hosted here on itch.io.</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>HTML5<ul><li>itch.io embedded version does not like the click to edit Name. For some reason it does not register the name, so you can't change it :/ <strong>I've hosted the latest HTML5 version on my VPS for the time being, you can access it by clicking on the link below in files.</strong></li><li>Music sometimes does not start automatically. It has to do with a condition in which there has to be user interaction with the webpage (not the game canvas) in order for it to start playing, or something like that. Will research it soon.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Feature backlog</strong></p>\n<p>I joined Improve Your Game Jam here in itch.io to further refine this and produce versions 1.2.1+. Here is the feature backlog:</p>\n<ul><li>Allow automatic shuffling of board when there are no more moves left. Possibly maintain current behavior in a \"hard\" mode.</li><li>Ability to shuffle board manually, associated with a certain score penalty.<br/>\n</li><li>Music on/off, Sound on/off, Board restart buttons.</li><li>Possibly combos that score more points!</li><li>Hints display (again, probably maintain current behavior in a \"hard\" mode)</li><li>Endless mode!</li><li>Android version!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d61f707b974918a30ad73d6cad63542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["biyectivo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
