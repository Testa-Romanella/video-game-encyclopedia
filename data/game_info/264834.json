We hate restrictions so there are NO timers, pay-to-win, energy bars and the like in the game. A player can purchase a skin for his avatar only.<br/><br/>CARDCORE is a pure PvP focused LCG that was born from our CCG Azorian Kings. <br/> <br/>In order to make the game equal for all we give ALL the cards to players at the start. You get 400+ cards of six races and all 12 warlords! You are free to make any experiments. No limits: you can play as you want and how much you want.<br/><br/>Enjoy the original and deep card game for FREE :)<br/><br/>P.S.: in case you're looking for PvE experience we've added the Azorian Kings banner into the game. The whole world of Azoria (campaign, quests, challenges and events, cross-play with CARDCORE players) is waiting for you here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/640850/Azorian_Kings/<br/>Sincerely yours,<br/>Daizor", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31dee68386038d0c21df921d41b7286e.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/clashofcards/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azorian", "kron0s_alexey", "Pavel_Balakin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elina Faritovna Balakina"], "esrb_rating": null}
