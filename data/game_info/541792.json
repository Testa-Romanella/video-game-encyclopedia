You are welcome to download and freely play this version as much as you want, with no limits. It was made in about 3-4 weeks and as a sample game to see how far we could push our first game.\u00a0 We have since lost the source code to this game so we will not be updating this, BUTTTTTTT, we will be working on a newer, more modern version of the game from what we learned in this release.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game, we had a blast making it. It is released as is. We do not support the software nor can make patches for the\u00a0 game due to the source code being lost. If you would like to make a donation to the project, please do so. Anything will help the progress on the new release of the game down the road. We currently have no time line as to when it will become a reality at this point, but all funds raised will greatly allow us to do more on the newer version, and, the funding will push the game to the top of our 'to do' list.</p>\n\n<p>Please let us know what you think... we love hearing your feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e3921253a8dac20df32f4bbf35016d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Light Storm Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
