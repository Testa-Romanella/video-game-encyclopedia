Once you get a bite, you will pull the fish out the water, but watch out, these fish wont get caught without a fight! Use your attack to slice the fish before it bites you!</p>\n<p>In each fight room, you need to defeat all the enemies, once you do, a portal will spawn to take you to the next room. Be sure to fight fast though, as the intense desert heat will quickly drain your health while away from the safety of the oasis!\u00a0</p>\n<p>After clearing a number of fight rooms, you will reach another oasis room to restock on fish. If you left any fish alive in the previous oasis, you will receive bombs as a reward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anytime you would die, if you have any fish, you will eat a fish to return to max health. Once you're out of fish, you will die for good, and will have to begin from the start.</p>\n<p>MUSIC CREDITS:<br/>\"Cottages\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Cyborg Ninja\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/3180d1cbdb0d4cd995da4bc72e5a1554.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wazzak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
