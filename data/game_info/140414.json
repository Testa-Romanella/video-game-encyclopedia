Currently only survival mode is available.\u00a0 This game will be free while in alpha for those that want to test it out and perhaps report on bugs and offer suggestions to improve game play.\u00a0 Due to the current control set up this game will only be available for platforms that support two button mice. So no mobile or Mac versions are planed at this time.</p>\n<p>Planed updates and additions:</p>\n<ul><li>More sentry gun types including mortars, flame throwers, missiles and lasers.</li><li>More throw-able items such as decoys and grenades.</li><li>Destroy-able walls and fences.</li><li>Retrievable items.

The final release may vary significantly from its current state. All game play features and content are simplified while in the alpha phase so I can concentrate on developing the foundation of the game and proving features. Once the game moves to the beta phase game content and features will start to become fixed and finalized before release. If you have any suggestions for features or content; or discover a bug, please visit the discussion board and post your ideas there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f37c71e6f590b36a9575136040abd3f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fideltfg"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
