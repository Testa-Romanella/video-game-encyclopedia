Our player is a traveler who has drifted to a unknown place. He found out a vestige of civilization and explore in it. After he walked out of the vestige and go through a forest, he saw the rise of new civilization. In this whole trip, he witnessed the decline and rebirth of civilization.</p>\n<p>The player needs to blow wind, this simple ability, to solve puzzles in different places, or interact with them.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0This game was made in an 8 days gamejam. The topic is \u201c\u4e07\u91cc\u540c\u98ce\u201d. Our understanding of this word is that when people unearth things from borderland, they found out the same element with their own culture. Therefore, we further associate with an interview with Hawking. The journalist asked him, what are the things you find most beautiful in science. Hawking said that Science is beautiful when it makes simple explanations of phenomena or connections between different observations. It reminds us to make a art game which could bring people emotional experience. We hope that players could have connections and live with this world instead of being alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u300a\u98ce\u4e4b\u5524\u300b\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5e73\u53f0\u8df3\u8dc3\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e3b\u89d2\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u6f02\u6cca\u5230\u5f02\u5730\u7684\u65c5\u4eba\uff0c\u5374\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u660e\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5524\u9192\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u673a\u5173\uff0c\u7a7f\u8fc7\u68ee\u6797\u53c8\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u6587\u660e\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u89c1\u8bc1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u660e\u7684\u8870\u843d\u4e0e\u65b0\u751f\u3002\u73a9\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u7528\u201c\u626c\u98ce\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u662f\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002</p>\n<p>\u672c\u6b21\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3b\u9898\u662f\u201c\u4e07\u91cc\u540c\u98ce\u201d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\uff1a\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u8fb9\u7586\u6316\u6398\u51fa\u7684\u9057\u8ff9\u4e2d\uff0c\u542b\u6709\u4e0e\u4e2d\u539f\u53e4\u8ff9\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u8054\u60f3\u5230\uff1a\u970d\u91d1\u6709\u6b21\u88ab\u8bb0\u8005\u91c7\u8bbf\u95ee\u5230\uff1a\u201c\u4f60\u89c9\u5f97\u4eba\u4e16\u95f4\u6700\u8ba9\u4f60\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u201d\u65f6\uff0c\u970d\u91d1\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u662f\u201c\u9065\u8fdc\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u201d \u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u5230\u505a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91cd\u60c5\u611f\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5b58\u6d3b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u6709\u7740\u6574\u4f53\u6709\u673a\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u952e\u76d8\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u652f\u6301xBox\u624b\u67c4\u6e38\u73a9\u3002\r\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<p>Who made it?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Programmer, Composer: \u6bdb\u5e38\u677e Changshong Mao\r\n  </p>\n<p>Artist: \u6731\u679c Guo Zhu\r\n  </p>\n<p>Programmer, Designer: \u5434\u4f73\u6e20 Jiaqu Wu\r\n  </p>\n<p>Artist: \u9ec4\u6021\u7136 Yiran Huang\r\n  </p>\n<p>Designer: \u66fe\u4e66\u626c Shuyang Zeng\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T10:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/275e554b052ffcf7497a50d698c90a7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam4days", "WuJiaQu", "MCATIN", "eromogasensei", "spanner", "Chukaalco"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
