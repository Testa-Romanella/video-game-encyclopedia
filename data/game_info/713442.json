The theme of the jam was colour changes everything so when in the non-coloured area you'll lose focus quickly (you have about 2/3 seconds of grace with full focus) and enemies do double damage.</p>\n<p>Game gets harder and harder with each world. There are two worlds, overworld and cave. Each time you go back to the overworld it'll get a little harder. In general the cave is harder and the overworld is the lul world to refresh.</p>\n<p>Hints to get to the hard mode:</p>\n<ul><li>Collect the red items. If you collect double health than you have containers you'll gain a new one. Always worth it. (upto 15)</li><li>When you get to the end levels attack enemies at the top first and hit them down</li><li>Collect items early game you'll need them late game</li><li>The game gives you less resources and more enemies as it gets harder so just get stuff when you can!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e0f8a7d39aba5ad912f96c475c42e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scott Foster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
