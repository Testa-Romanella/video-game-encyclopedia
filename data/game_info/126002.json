Essentially it tries to model single cell organisms. The rules describe when a cell is born or dies according to the state of it's eight neighbour cells.</p>\n<p>You can look up the principle and exact rules on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>The game (or simulation) allows you to add and change cells, put in some predefined patterns and start/stop the simulation. </p>\n<p>It's fun to watch how patterns emerge, and sometimes go into looping stages.</p>\n<p>This project is also available on my personal homepage.</p>\n<p>You can freely use and modify this for any purpose you want.
