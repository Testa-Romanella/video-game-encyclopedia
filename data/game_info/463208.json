The gods deemed the world unworthy of light and dark, since they believed they could govern themselves.</p>\n<p>Then, on a fateful day, light and dark were reincarnated as humans. Two fraternal twin children. The balance was restored, and all began to fall into place again. Until the world blamed the original loss of light and dark on magic users, beginning to kill them and break them, turning them into soldiers for the front lines of war.</p>\n<p>A young group of children hid their traits and magical fingerprints, seeming as ordinary as possible. They grew to the age of 14 until light and dark began to fight because dark didn't understand why everyone got off the hook so easily with her sister.\u00a0 And so, with all the power they could muster, they fought a devastating battle.</p>\n<p>To keep her friends safe from her sister, light traded her own memories and powers by using her biggest spell to lock dark away for some time, at least to when she could come back older and wiser.</p>\n<p>Light no longer remembered anything, sent off with her sisters final wish. For everyone to forget light. The world fell at the knees of dark once she broke out of the weak spell, and now it is up to her friends to help her restore her memories and either restore order and make amends with her sister, or to take all the power for herself and govern the world alone with the guilt, but with the reassuring thought knowing the world will be safe.</p>\n<p><strong>It's up to you.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T04:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c191db70b432ba3508e105b722ecf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mari!"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
