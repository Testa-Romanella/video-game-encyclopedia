Billions of years later another meteor hit and broke the flower free. After humans found and contained the flower found in the crater, they started experimenting on it, making a fatal mistake and feeding it anabolic steroids thus making it stronger and deadlier. The flower then broke through the containment and started showing signs of root growth. The roots on the flower seem to work like mouths that try to find a place to feed this immobile monstrosity. The roots grow by making external growths on the flower that travel on the roots and attaching to the furthest point of the root becoming part of it, thus making them longer.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\nIn a faraway land called Suomi, we find ourselves in the shoes of one named\u00a0Joni \u201dJohn\u00a0Souls\u201d Sielut,\u00a0who is on a task to prevent\u00a0His task is to shoot the external growths, preventing it\u00a0from\u00a0spreading its roots outside of the volcanic grounds of the crater. Because it is predicted that if the roots get themselves to fertile\u00a0soil, the plant starts to grow exponentially and pollute the atmosphere with toxic fumes meant to destroy\u00a0all\u00a0living organisms.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Design:<br/>Sami Turpeinen<br/>Frans Pesonen<br/><br/>Audio:<br/>Otto Kemppainen<br/><br/>Programming:<br/>Lauri Ojanper\u00e4<br/>Danil Smirnov<br/>Eemeli Koivisto<br/>Konsta Kurkinen<br/><br/>Artists:\u00a0<br/>Jere Juntunen<br/>Noora Knuutinen<br/>Miina J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4<br/>Liida J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4<br/>Anssi Liimatta<br/><br/>Resident Coffee Maker:<br/>V\u00e4in\u00f6 Verho<br/><br/>Outsourced Helper:<br/>Kim Kupiainen\r\n\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T23:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a042e9395a7a84a6e91e85a8e5a793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feyrex"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
