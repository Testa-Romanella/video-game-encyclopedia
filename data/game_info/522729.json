Time to reflect that!</p>\n<p>Here is the link to Fun1, for comparison:</p>\n<p>https://mysteriousdeveloper.itch.io/fun-1</p>\n<p>Regardless, Fun2 is, to quote one of its\u00a0NEW characters, \"much, much better\" than Fun1.</p>\n<p>Here are its features:</p>\n<p>1. 2 Maps(Twice as many as Fun1!)</p>\n<p>2. 5 Types of Enemies(+1 type which is less common), already more than Fun1!</p>\n<p>3. 4 Kinds of Weapons(1 of them particularly rare and powerful), 4 times more than Fun1!</p>\n<p>4. Survival against waves of an Enemy. Ok, it's not too different from Fun1 in that respect, except:</p>\n<p>5. 16 \"Twists\".\u00a0What are \"Twists\"? Twists are slight alterations to the game which may(or not) drastically alter gameplay. Two are picked in each playthrough, and are changed up every 5 waves.</p>\n<p>6. A primitive upgrade system(inherited from Fun1) - Upgrade your max health, max stamina and damage!</p>\n<p>7. A better voice actor(\"The Dictator\", he calls himself).\u00a0Technically speaking, Fun1 also had the same voice actor, albeit with a worse microphone</p>\n<p>Here are the controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move Around(I'm sure that's the most difficult to remember)</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Shoot(Just a tad difficult to infer)</p>\n<p>F - Walk up to dead Enemies with Dollar Signs emanating from them, and press F to loot them for some moolah, or walk up to certain Traps(which can spawn as a result of certain \"Twists\", and hold down F to pick it up</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Sprint</p>\n<p>P - Pause the game</p>\n<p>R - Reload</p>\n<p>There may or may not be other controls, and they may or may not be explained ingame.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed my game, consider supporting me on Patreon:</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/mysteriousdeveloper</p>\n<p>Fun2 will be updated over time, to bring more enemies, features, weapons, twists and maps, so this is\u00a0<strong>certainly not\u00a0</strong>the finished product.</p>\n<p>Regardless, all the best to you, and I hope you have Fun, too. (See what I did there?)</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>(<strong>You don't have to read this unless you are\u00a0<em>particularly\u00a0</em>interested)</strong></p>\n<p>Since this game was also made for the 2020 \"Finish your Game\" Jam, here are some dated developer logs as to what I did in the past few days:</p>\n<p>Fun2 is a rather simplistic first person shooter where you have to fight against waves of a certain enemy, armed with a random weapon, and survive for as long as possible. However, in every game there are also 2 \"Twists\". \"Twists\" are alterations to the gameplay to make it more interesting. There are currently 16 twists(discover them all!). There are also 5 possible enemies, and 4 possible weapons(one of which is particularly rare, but very powerful if you're lucky to gain it).\u00a0</p>\n<p>16/11/2020:</p>\n<p>Today, I dedicated the day to prettying up the map with some pixel-style textures(rather than random textures I got off the internet).</p>\n<p>Then, I proceeded to directly copy the map from Fun1 into Fun2.</p>\n<p>Looking at both maps, I found that they were very dull, so I changed the Light Generation rules a little and now it's a lot more bright(which conflicts with the white text I use in my GUI)</p>\n<p>I also made a start on the Menus(finally), but didn't get to finish them.</p>\n<p>17/11/2020:</p>\n<p>Today, I FINALLY hooked up all the Menus to the actual game, so now it is SOMEWHAT playable. All that Fun2 needs now is a pause menu in the actual game, a \"Credits\" part where we delve into who did what, and of course an \"Options\" setting(in my developing time I think I grew pretty sick of all the music).</p>\n<p>Previously, the only way I could know what \"Twists\" were present in the game was by looking at the public variables in the Unity Editor. Now, there are little symbols in the Top-Right corner showing exactly what Twists are currently active. Moreover, when new Twists are picked (either in the beginning of the game or every 5 waves), there is now a sort of animation showing what twists are picked. It also shows a description of how each Twist works, negating the need for a tutorial.</p>\n<p>18/11/2020:</p>\n<p>Today, I fixed an issue that was present, but one I avoided in all my playtesting - if several enemies pin you in a corner, there is a chance for you to fall through the map. Now, if that happens, the player will get teleported back onto the map, allowing them to continue the slaughter.</p>\n<p>One of the twists, \"Bug Bugger\", involves enemies being shrunken to tiny sizes and being frightfully fast. Previously, aiming at them and shooting them was quite a nuiscance. Now, the player can simply jump on the shrunken enemies and squish them like bugs.</p>\n<p>I also added an \"Options\" menu in the Main menu, wherein I allowed the player to change Mouse Sensitivity, as well as music, sound and voice volume.</p>\n<p>I also greatly improved the GUI. Unfortunately, silly as I am, I didn't take a screenshot of the PREVIOUS GUI, so there's nothing to compare it against. Regardless, it was pretty bad compared to the current one.</p>\n<p>I added an actual Title to the Main Menu.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I played through 15 waves of the game 5 times, and, using the results of my play, rebalanced some of the Twists.</p>\n<p>19/11/2020:</p>\n<p>Just some finishing touches.</p>\n<p>20/11/2020:</p>\n<p>Ditto. Converting it to WebGL was more of a nuisance than expected...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T06:27:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/727ddd947dec21801c54fe0798c867b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MysteriousDeveloper"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
