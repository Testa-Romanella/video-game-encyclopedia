I made it with my brother over a 4 week period. We used Unity, and all assets have been created by us, except for the font.<br/></p>\n<p>We made Glinny's recipe.</p>\n<p>The scenario is that you've been cursed by a Demon and you're looking for a potion that will cure you. You have arrived at a Witch's house in a far-off land. The Witch can help you, but she needs you to collect 3 ingredients.</p>\n<p>You use an item called a Witch Ball to collect monsters and then throw them into the cauldron. If you've captured a monster in the Witch Ball you can throw the ball to kill enemies. To release the monster, just throw it at a wall.<br/></p>\n<p>Throwing 3 ingredients into the cauldron will make a potion. Try different ingredients and see what you get.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move: WASD or arrow keys<br/></p>\n<p>Throw ball: SHIFT</p>\n<p>Interact/Dialog: E or SPACE</p>\n<p>Pause: ESC<br/></p>\n\n<p>Spoilers below.</p>\n\r\nGlinny's Ingredients\r\n<ul><li>Instant death from touching the SIDE of a spike.
