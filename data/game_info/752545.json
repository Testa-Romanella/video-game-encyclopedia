{"id": 752545, "slug": "eva-warrior-princess-demo-windows", "name": "Eva: Warrior Princess DEMO (Windows)", "name_original": "Eva: Warrior Princess DEMO (Windows)", "description": "<p>Buy Me a coffee (support the game!):</p>\n<p>buymeacoffee.com/EdgyOtaku</p>\n<p>This is a demo of a large project made in RPG Maker designed to be a long, thought-provoking game exploring serious topics such as oppression, loss of a parent, and the very nature of one's own humanity even when suppressed, all-the-while keeping your spirits up with our heroine's sarcastic tone and terse vocabulary. Join Eva: a Demi-Beast princess forced to marry an Elven prince to unite the two kingdoms and end embargos and mutual distrust. Though, things get even worse for her when he is kidnapped by a mysterious\u00a0 woman, forcing her on a perilous journey to rescue him, where she quickly realized the world is almost never as it seems.</p>\n<p>NOTE: There is a known performance issue I am currently trying to fix. If after selecting your class Eva's room does not load after a few seconds, simply restart the game; that should be enough. If push comes to shove, I might be forced to use the default sprites instead of upscaled ones.</p>\n\n<p>This demo may not look like much (currently including just the first battle and a prototype of Eva's room), but a lot of blood, sweat, tears, love, and passion went into it. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/11636d6d8e761464f3ae2ec82f50d00a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edgy Otaku"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
