It should take you around 5 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nMoveWASDInteractFSprintShiftOpen/Close Pause MenuESC\r\n<p>Credits:</p><p>Created by: Kevin Hutchins</p><p>Using:</p><p>FPS Controller by\u00a0Breog\u00e1n Hackett</p><p>Retro 3D Shader Pack by LEAKYFINGERS</p><p>Models by Kenney and Quaternius</p><p>This was an interesting learning experience for me. All my previous Unity games haven't been in a retro style (well, not explicitly aimed at that), have generally been procedurally generated, and usually done in a more expansive timespan. I\u00a0ended up cutting a lot of corners, whether by leaving placeholder not-quite-period-appropriate 3D models in or by removing interactability from the game, and ended up with much less polish than I'm happy with. Still, I'm content with what I achieved.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Because I only have a Windows machine, it's the only platform I've tested on. I've posted Mac and Linux builds, but I\u00a0have no idea if they work or not.\u00a0Be aware that they may be buggy, and may not work entirely. If you let me know in the comments, I'll try to resolve the issue.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:51:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/1734d4740db2bf130e1805d1032ba17a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
