In this puzzle type, the numbers  are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines  of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a  clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three  filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between  successive sets.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>\u00a0VNonograms</strong> uses the default Pico-8 control scheme, that being:\r\n    </p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Up/Down/Left/Right</strong>: With the arrow keys, WASD or the dpad/joystick on your controller\r\n</li><li><strong>Accept/Reveal colored tile</strong>: Z / C / N / (A) or (Y) on XBox controllers\r\n</li><li><strong>Mark tile as blank</strong>: X / V / M / (B) or (X) on Xbox controllers\r\n</li></ul>\r\nProject page\r\n<p>https://github.com/uvehj/VNonograms\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f8da023785e8b13569a64962cd1bb43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Uvehj"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
