Your weapon is a lethal beam that forms along two charges. Place charges such that the beam passes through targets to destroy them.\r\n<p>INLINE TEST is a product of 5 weeks of messing around with C++ coding language. Primarily as\u00a0a programming challenge and a learning opportunity, the game was built without a dedicated game\u00a0engine. The project does, however, include external\u00a0libraries, namely PixelGameEngine UI framework by OneLoneCoder, and cute_c2 Collision Detection framework\u00a0by RandyGaul.<br/><br/>Please, feel free to leave your feedback. All criticism is welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb5b1424236cc4e1a8083bc04a6419f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ven"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
