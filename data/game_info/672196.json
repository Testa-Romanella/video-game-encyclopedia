Tested by my 7yo with great results.</p>\nA Lonely Knight Braves The Darkness<br/>\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong><br/>My son had a hard time learning to read clock faces in Kindergarten. To me, the best way to <strong><em>share knowledge</em></strong> is to practice and teach through repetition.<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Knight's Sprites\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong><br/>The game had a couple other clock based mini games\u00a0but\u00a0around 36 hours in, I got stuck fighting with Unity's new Input System and spent way too much time attempting to make it work. After mangling the code around I finally just scrapped the Input System but at the cost of some other mini games I was prototyping. This leaves the game feeling a bit more empty than I'd like but that's a game jam for you.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nMy First Idea Was Math Based\r\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong><br/>Made in Adobe Illustrator and Procreate. Was going going for a storybook kind of style and feel to the game. Something child friendly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nWeapons I didn't get the chance to implement\r\n<p><strong>Music:<br/></strong>All the music was made in Logic X in the last 2 hours of the jam. Not my best work but it gets the job done.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Video:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Developer:</strong><br/>A single person developer using Unity. Built all the code, graphics, animation and music myself within the jams 2 day timeframe.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Backtrace</li><li>EnergyBarToolkit</li><li>DoTween</li><li>Misc SFX</li></ul>\n\r\nAn unused Spider enem\r\n\n<p><strong>Backtrace:</strong><br/>Prior to this jam I'd never used or even heard of Backtrace. After seeing how simple it was to setup and use I can't imagine deploying a game without it. Being able to visualize errors logs and keep them all in one place is amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong><br/>Always happy to hear your feedback and ideas. Please leave a comment and let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/039bad8f4670649aafa00c9e3c018667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshBurleson"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
