{"id": 391064, "slug": "be-quiet-and-drive-far-away", "name": "Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)", "name_original": "Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)", "description": "Install instructions<p>Created for the class\u00a0Digital Storytelling and Resistance at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2019<br/></p>\n<p>This work was loosely inspired by the following manifesto:</p>\n<p><strong>Doomer Manifesto</strong><br/>Find here a document that needs no writing, signed by no one, for these<br/>words do not come from a person fitting any metric of humanity. A document<br/>signed by Apathy. Written for no other reason than for an excuse to keep a<br/>screen emanating the only light into a dead room.<br/>The Brain that absorbs these words may yet produce currents powerful<br/>enough to flow into the components that produce any detectable pleasure, any<br/>emotion at all. This Brain would do well to leave now, swiftly, and stay away.<br/>The Brain that has not seen its reflection in the void, crazed, cackling and terrifying, may hope to never see that damning sight. The Brain that has seen<br/>everything at its right time and no more is a tender blossom, with sufficient<br/>vigor and life to shake Frost\u2019s tepid cling. But if the hubs of light in this Brain<br/>have all blinked away, has had its power lines cut down and its copper wiring<br/>scrapped for pennies, if the inside of this Brain is as suffocatingly dark as the<br/>abyss it floats in, then the words below will serve as no more than a succinct<br/>synthesis of what this Brain already accepts.<br/>Fear is the name that the road into abyss calls itself, for Fear leads this Brain<br/>here. But Fear is an exhausting emotion, and through fatigue the Brain forgets<br/>this name. In spite of itself the Brain forgets Fear, as a fish in the crushing<br/>depths forgets water. The Brain encaged in your structure has brought you<br/>here.<br/>On thinly carpeted floorboards you lie, your vertebrae flattening in resignation. All you feel is exhaustion, the exhaustion of Fear. Fear flays your skin,<br/>incinerates your endo-skeleton, until all that remains is scar tissue and dead<br/>nerve endings. The time of your impotent body and the Brain encaged inside<br/>is bleeding out fast. You attempt to project astrally, looking down at the body<br/>you left below and see a stranger. As you descend to the stranger, should you<br/>find yourself grasping for ways to dull the oncoming incineration, the axioms<br/>proposed here will serve you no worse than any others you may choose to abide.<br/><br/>Presented here is a call to inaction:<br/></p>\n<p>ISOLATION\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dispel the hope that you will ever stop being utterly alone. No matter the<br/>people you surround yourself with, the elaborate lies you construct, the act<br/>you play so dutifully, no one can truly know the twisted machinery that<br/>turns within you, to risk being cut by the hundred jagged teeth of septic<br/>gears. For the sake of yourself and others, allow for as much isolation as<br/>you can in your time here.</p>\n<p>NEURO-CHEMISTRY</p>\n<p>\u00a0If possible, try to secure a steady access to a select few mind-altering<br/>drugs if possible. You have already or most likely will lose the ability to<br/>feel anything, desensitized by the world around you and its vices that you<br/>do not possess the willpower to avert. At the very least, pick a reasonably<br/>effective agent amongst both stimulants and depressants, so you may at<br/>least simulate a flux between relaxation and arousal.<br/>ART Immerse yourself into art, literature and film that speaks to your sensibilities. Your time in the flesh is thankfully fleeting, and there are a plethora<br/>of doomed literature and films to fill these wasted hours with, created<br/>perhaps by people with Brains such as yours. Music in particular, may<br/>speak to you when no voice does. An exquisite numbness is to be found in<br/>blaring distortion, indistinguishable melody and searing volume blissfully<br/>pinning you down like a weighted blanket.</p>\n<p>PERSONA\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adopt an ideology that minimizes friction with your surroundings; to<br/>blend in is to go unseen. See Isolation. The machinery of the forces<br/>that govern you are ridiculously out of control, reducing your principles<br/>to yet another prop to convincingly sell the act of your life.</p>\n<p>ANGER\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find outlets for your anger, the last emotion you can still feel after waves<br/>of anxiety and apathy crash upon your psyche and erode it all away. Anger<br/>is a form of hope, a sense that you possess any shred of agency to affect<br/>change. Allow this to dissipate in some physical exertion, masturbation,<br/>weight-lifting or walking are valid options. Rest assured, like all others,<br/>anger too will pass, leaving only void.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7d09c8bde79dec5571efe29b74c163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["R1G"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
