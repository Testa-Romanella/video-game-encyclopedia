Also, be careful of evil HR handing out pink slips! Workers come in different colours and to attract them you need to have a minimum number of workers in your union.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Blue collar (0)</li><li>Red collar (50)</li><li>Gray collar (100)</li><li>White collar (red tie) (150)</li><li>White collar (baby blue tie) (200)</li></ul>\n<p>Use Arrow keys to control, press X for help and press Z when you get stuck in corners (collisions are still quite finicky in this early build!). Make your way to the boardroom in time if you want a \"high score\" but you can also take your time and slowly chill, the game doesn't end once time is up.</p>\n<p>Used TIC-80 for this entry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/8237673028d7569cff717930465f4e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["randomphantom"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
