We created this prototype during our formation, as part of an exercise of \"Rapid Prototyping\" (Create a prototype within a certain period of time).</p>\n<p>We were also dealing with certain requirements:</p>\n<ul><li>At least 3 Mini Games</li><li>A High replay value</li><li>Some Unique Selling Points</li><li>Only one client app</li><li>At least 2 players, that have to play simultaneously</li><li>A not serious and broadly attractive topic</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0So we decide to create a game that took place in a crazy show (like the japanese ones) that offers to the world mum fights ! And to put more in evidence the comedy mood of the game, we chose an artistic direction that reminds the funny animations that can me found on youtube (Like Deotoons or Colas Bim).</p>\n<p>It was really cool working on that project !\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0-Leeroy DOBARIA: Coder / Lead Programmer /\u00a0Project Manager \u00a0</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49: Portfolio</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49: Itch page</p>\n\n<p>-Etienne-marie GRONDIN: 2D Artist / Artistic Director</p>\n<p>-Joachim DEVEAUX : Code\u00a0/ Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T07:21:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffbc61268bd65757e8b245395766a721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GEM", "Roy-Sama"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
