Play with friends or strangers in online play, or play offline with friends face-to-face!<br/><br/>Exploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for iOS.<br/><br/>Creat\u200bed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).<br/><br/>KEY FEATURES:<br/><br/>- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.<br/><br/>- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers<br/><br/>- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal<br/><br/>- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens<br/><br/>- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history<br/><br/>In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t\u200bhe game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Exploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.
