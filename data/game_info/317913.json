It is an arena FPS where you must kill 25 enemies to win. Each staff shoots a different projectile that has a different damage type: fire, ice, lightning, and arcane. The enemies are immune to a random damage type so the player must use other types of magic to kill them. I was able to use an amazing spell asset pack that was on sale as part of Unity's may sale.</p>\n<p>The amazing staff I used was created and provided by Adrian Jones. It would normally look so much better but Unity was being difficult.<br/>Here is a link to Adrian Jones' ArtStation<br/>https://www.artstation.com/cranbena<br/>and a link to the staff itself<br/>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/XA4Q3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3c5727acc95f74761f13933a6cc931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tgarcia9"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
