Well, aren't thou in luck, my friend! In there here areas, under our King's rule, prosperity prevails! Trade reaches far beyond our seas, bellies swell full of produce, smiles and cheer flood the streets...<br/>But there is one venture that remains unhelmed... House-makin'!<br/>See, tavern-dwelling folk have been spillin' talk 'bout this patch of land uphill that the King's got his garment all wrinkled up about. He's looking to get a sprawling town built there, round about a dozen hurls next to the limestone quarry! Guess what he needs - corageous visionaries with hands of gold like yerself! Don't fret, I can see the inky journals peekin' through that bag o' yours! So what're you waitin' fer? Think ye can challenge the great many awe-some artist\u00e9s of thy Continent? Why straddle on there and get your rocks off then, I'll be sending the King the splendid news! Have no fear, Architect, I'm sure  that you'll bring much joy to the lands, and the King shan't leave thou without praise!</p>\n<p>That was some fine description fiction wasn't it. Sorry to break the mood, but this is a demo/prototype I made in 2020. It's unfortunately very barebones, so reading and following the instructions is strongly advised. I planned on polishing the project and possibly even expanding on it before releasing, but the project files are seemingly long lost as of this point. Definitely will keep the concept in mind for future projects though, stay tuned!</p>\n<p> All 3D Assets used made by Kenney: www.kenney.nl<br/>\r\n(www.kenney.nl/assets/fantasy-town-kit)<br/>\r\n(www.kenney.nl/assets/nature-kit)<br/>\r\nA sincere 'Thank you' for all your work helping the game-dev community across the world! \ud83d\udc9a\r\n</p>\r\n How to play: \r\n<ul>\n<li>&lt;WASD&gt; to move around</li>\n<li>[Space] to ascend / [LShift] to descend</li>\n<li>[LClick] to place tiles / [RClick] to delete tiles</li>\n<li>[Mouse Wheel] to rotate tiles</li>\n<li>[Q] to select previous tile / [E] to select next tile</li>\n<li>[TAB] / [R] to move between hotbar pages</li>\n<li>[Alt+F4] to exit the game (crude, I know, I just can't add in anything to the game at this point)</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/5572c6f17655cd78e3ffdad0e0f04135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scrillrock"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
