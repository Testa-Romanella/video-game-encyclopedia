The concepts behind a neural network have been distilled to their essence in this idle simulation.</p>\n<p>Not to say the game is simple. Sure, it starts simple with only nodes, training, and data, but soon balloons into a complex idle game with prestige and upgrades. Not to mention offline support.</p>\n<p>Take on the role of a young undergraduate student as you become quite the idle tycoon. Soon you&#39;ll be rivaling even GPT-3.</p>\n<p>Perceptron is not just another idle clicker. It was designed around the idea of training a neural network and has taken inspiration from many neural network topics. Who knows, you might even end up learning something.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-08T05:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf903868fd08508dfe2b3b4764d4078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
