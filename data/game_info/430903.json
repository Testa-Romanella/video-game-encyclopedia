But good news! You are still alive! You are an ice cream seller. They will not kill if you keep selling them the best ice cream.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Control your character with arrow keys. Enter to interact with houses/van and mouse to interact with objects in the screen.</p>\n<p>Gather ingredients to create ice cream and mix them in your workshop!</p>\n<p>To create an ice cream, you first need to create a base for the ice cream. There are two types of ice cream:</p>\n<ul><li>water-based ice cream (mix water and sugar), to create sorbets</li><li>custard-based ice cream (mix milk, 2 creams, 6 eggs, salt and sugar), to create regular ice creams</li></ul>\n<p>Once you have bases, you can mix them with fruit or species to create new ice cream!\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul><li>Lemon sorbet =\u00a0water-based ice cream + 3 limes</li><li>Vanilla ice cream = custard-based ice cream + 2 vanilla beans</li><li>Most basic recipes require two ingredients:\u00a0a base and between 1 and 8 of a\u00a0fruit/plant. In general, the bigger the fruit/plant, the smaller the number you need.</li><li>Not every combination is possible (for example, there is no raspberry sorbet).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Find out new recipes and put them in the comments!!! There are 21 flavors of ice creams!!!</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><strong>Ingredients can be gathered from fruit trees and plants, or lying around\u00a0</strong></em>(note:\u00a0due to time limitations, some ingredients [that do not grow in\u00a0plants or trees]\u00a0could not be added. They will be added after the jam version).<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Some fruits, plants and objects grow faster than others... check every day!</p>\n<p>Once you have ingredients, head to your workshop and craft.</p>\n<ul><li>Left click ingredients and mixture bowl to put them there.</li><li>Add two or more ingredients and then mix them!</li><li>If the recipe is not correct, you will lose the ingredients... if it is correct you will have a new mixture/ice cream!\u00a0</li><li>Once you have several flavors, you can reorder them using RIGHT click - only the first 12 ice cream slots are available on your ice cream cart!</li></ul>\n<p>Keep track of the time. Whenever at the top it says \"Time to Sell\", head to your ice cream van and wait for the aliens to come.</p>\n<ul><li>After interacting with the cart, wait until each alien gets in line and asks for his ice cream.</li><li>Try to match the ice cream exactly and sell it to him before he leaves! If not he will be unhappy. Keep track of the alien happiness bar at the top.</li><li>Some times (with increasing probability) an alien will request a flavor you don't have! He will get mad, but hopefully you are able to meed the demand of the rest of them!</li></ul>\n<p>Try to make as much money as you can and level up! (Each time you level up, aliens will ask for new flavors of ice cream!\u00a0Be prepared to serve them!) Also, when you level up, you will unlock more cones and decorations for the ice creams - but be ready, because the aliens will ask for them!</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<ul><li>F9 in version 0.2 switches between arrow keys and WASD.</li><li>F11 switches character between a male and a female character.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85c/85c9c72ff6fe9de11eab4efdfb362b12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["biyectivo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
