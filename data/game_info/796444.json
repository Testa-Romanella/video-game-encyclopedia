Why would you go out of your way to take pictures of creatures that were thought to be myth? To get famous on the internet of course! Cat pictures are overrated, now it is time to take pictures of dangerous monsters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The more pictures you take, the more internet points you get. The more internet points you get, the more famous you are and the more you can travel and explore.\u00a0 Objects in the environment can help aid in luring in these camera shy creatures so you can snag a sweet photo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is currently in early development with more content planned over the game's development. There's still plenty of missing content and developer tools visible in the current build.\u00a0Currently the content is rather light just as a proof of concept. There is only one area, Yosemite National Park, and one Cryptid, the Fresno Nightcrawler. The plan for the future is to add more cryptids and more locations to explore and take pictures of.</p>\n<p>Game designed and programmed by Packed Lunch Studios<br/></p>\n<p>Music done by the wonderful TKIMuse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T13:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c79743f013573006464dfc987ebffe25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PackedLunch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
