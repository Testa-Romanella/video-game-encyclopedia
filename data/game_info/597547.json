He loves cooking and his family. This cooking game has you complete 3 tasks to make soup in the allotted time. If you're too slow, you fail!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am aware of a few bugs that are quite disruptive, such as cutting boards spawning and disappearing rapidly. This game was made in under 48 hours and I could not for the life of me figure out a fix. I may update the game in the\u00a0\u00a0future, but who knows. I am happy with how things turned out for such a short time period! Music, SFX, art, were all made by me. I used a color palette called Choco Dream, by Potvii.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f138ff9e20a4247cc2e77e7462bb36b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jhunter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
