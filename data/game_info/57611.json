It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. The characters of the game were designed by Takenami Hideyuki (\u7af9\u6d6a\u79c0\u884c) who had previously taken part in designs for Sakura Taisen, and specifically, enemy designs for Sakura Taisen 2. The game itself was modified from Tokimeki Memorial: Forever with You, with improvements including an expanded area to display backgrounds and larger characters. However, the gameplay between the two series varies in many areas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment", "RED Company"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
