There aren't really any rules, just do whatever. Crash into the fully dynamic tires, or drive around with friends. Pick and paint whatever car you like, and just have fun drifting and jumping around. And Poly Racing, early access or not, is going to be a community driven game. We really want to keep the game exciting with new features and content very often and hope that you will suggest your ideas for Poly Racing!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\nPhysics Based Environment<br/>\r\n12 Cars<br/>\r\n12 Levels<br/>\r\nMore to come!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:48:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/85233131ecea515a6bbc51980043ee74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blinker Fluid"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blinker Fluid"], "esrb_rating": null}
