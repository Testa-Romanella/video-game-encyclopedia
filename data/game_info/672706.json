But be warned! The ground is unstable and your path to retreat may be blocked by the ground falling away! There are no penalties for dying but you do restart at the beginning of the level!</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys/WASD to move. The camera will follow your character. Find various interactables (switches or pressure plates) and while standing nearby, use your Left Mouse Button to activate. If you get stuck, walk into the lava. The level will restart with doors and paths reset. Press Escape to pause the game or quit.</p>\n\n<p>All art and sound effects made by me.\u00a0 Background music courtesy of the random generator at https://strofe.com.\u00a0 Lava effect adapted from multiple tutorials on YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>If you need help navigating the maze, I have attached a PDF with my level design work (from Microsoft Excel) that uses color coding to help navigate the levels. <strong>WARNING</strong>!
