The twist is that the rules of the game are not in your control.\u00a0Each turn, the rules change. These rules may alter the possible moves of pieces (distance, type, rotation), their positions, or even cast certain effects on them.</p>\n<p>These changes are shown to you beforehand. Therefore the goal of the game is to try to adapt to the ever-changing ruleset and strategize ahead of time to complete the 10 available levels.</p>\n<p><strong>All the art, code, and audio were made during the 48 hour period of the jam.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Unfortunately, due to a\u00a0bug that I had no control over - and that I discovered too late -, which made the game IMPOSSIBLE to play, I had to remove it from the jam in question. This version is still the Jam version, just with that bug removed...</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98b/98bdcd8f5c8f1aeadded625020ce0bbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FireGreeks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
