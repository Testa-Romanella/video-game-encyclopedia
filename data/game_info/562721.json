This came after I was browsing splore for a while, and checking out carts online, looking at how other people were putting together their games.</p>\n<p>The is built on a multi-state system I found on the wiki, a cart I found on splore called RP 0.1 by Paperdo which helped me wrap my head around tables and figure out collision, and a tutorial on DocRobs (http://gamedev.docrobs.co.uk/creating-objects-in-pico-8-using-tables-to-imitate-...) that helped me understand how to use tables for multiple entities. Also the wiki in general, because wow that's a life saver.<br/></p>\n<p>All in all, after I decided I wanted to do the project,  it took me around a week to get this made. I think I want to work on it further and refine the game.</p>\n<p>If I do, it would probably include: <br/>figuring out a way to move by 1 pixel without the collision being too obtuse to move around properly.<br/>Getting\u00a0a specific amount of enemies to spawn randomly without them clogging up the top half of the maze.<br/>Enhancing the AI so they move in mostly predictable ways.<br/>Nicer graphics instead of random blobs.<br/>Levels, and different maze designs.<br/></p>\n<p>The enemies may move once a second and you win by killing all the enemies. Currently a random amount spawn each game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0f4d3b9b9f77e414a2f725cbd2e528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["luxurio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
