In <em>ReDiscovery</em>, you take control of a rover tasked to find ancient relics, geological samples, and remnants of past expeditions.</p>\n<p><em>Web Version Note: ReDiscovery </em><em>is intended to be played as a standalone build. The WebGL version is provided for convenience, but includes lower quality lighting, possible visual bugs and performance issues. If you have any of these issues, please download and play the standalone build.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Created for <strong>Mini Jam 75</strong> (Theme: \"<strong>Wisdom</strong>\", Limitation: \"<strong>Weight as a mechanic</strong>\") in 3 days.<br/>All visual assets and code created by me during the jam.</p>\n<p>I had a great time making <em>ReDiscovery</em>. It was my first time properly using a lot of the tools in Unity, such as terrain and wheel physics. I also learned a lot from implementing the items system, and persistently keeping track of which items have been collected/stored/learned. Specifically, I learned a lot about serialization and some specific applications of static classes and variables\u00a0in the context of Unity. If I were to do it again, I would probably spend a little bit longer populating the world and signalling to the player places of interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong></p>\n<p>Music:<em>\u00a0</em><em>Scott Buckley</em></p>\n<p>Font:<em>\u00a0</em><em>Recharge by Typodermic Fonts Inc.</em></p>\n<p>Sound Effects:\u00a0<em>LloydEvans09,\u00a0reg7783,\u00a0adeluc4,\u00a0<br/>sewdio2003,\u00a0blueblomer,\u00a0VKProduktion,\u00a0trullilulli,\u00a0<br/>IanLyanx,\u00a0GameDeC,\u00a0Paul368,\u00a0ZvinbergsA,\u00a0fordps3,\u00a0</em><em>paulnorthyorks</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7a5ec2214b56f65e83778f6de9924f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jacobgreendev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
