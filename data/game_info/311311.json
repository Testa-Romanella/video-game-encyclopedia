But, they can shoot at each other! You only have the bits that you see, so if a thruster gets shot off, you don't have that thruster anymore and may not be able to move fully.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Player 1: WSAD (move) 1 (shoot)</li><li>Player 2: Arrow Keys (move) Enter (shoot)</li></ul>\n<p>Based on three of my favourite space games: \"Spacewar!\" \"Splaymaster\" and \"Captain Forever\". I suggest you give those a play at some point.<br/></p>\n<p>The AI's a bit basic, but it seems to work OK. I have a tough enough\u00a0time beating it, so it can't be that bad.\u00a0 I\u00a0did want to build some more ships to chose from, but for now there are only two: a fast lightly armed one, and a slow heavily armed one. You can win with either one.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Version of Godot</strong>: Latest from github.
