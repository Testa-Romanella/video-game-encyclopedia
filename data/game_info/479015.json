Not all customers rewind before returning, so the tapes will take different times to rewind. Keep your 4 speed rewinders running at optimum performance to reach a HIGH SCORE! It is a crappy job, but at least you have some good music to listen to while you work.</p>\n<p>Drag and Drop tape on the rewinders and click the rewinders when they turn green to eject the tape and open it for the next one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8cf1bcc15f734a854244bb3a4a2a63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["B Makes Stuff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
