Your goal in each stage is to eat all the fruit to unlock the goal, then escape through the goal with all Snakebirds. Eating a fruit will increase a Snakebird's length by one. Falling on spikes or off the screen will kill your Snakebird and you have to restart. Some levels can have movable objects, which can help you on your way.</p><p>There are a couple minor gameplay changes compared to the original game: Movable objects must not fall off the screen, and there is NO undo feature (this is more cruel than it may sound at first, so be careful).</p><p>A word of warning: This game has a very high difficulty curve, especially if you have not played the original game. However, all stages are selectable from the start, so you can always try your luck on a new challenge.<br/></p><p>Happy snakebirding!</p><p><em>September 2016</em><br/></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><p>DPad: movement<br/>A: switch between Snakebirds<br/>Select: restart the stage<br/>Start: return to title screen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee7111b78d466d54be20a7cc0ef7b483.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fb1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
