Today you woke up under a storm cloud in the courtyard of a massive castle. You don't know how you got there, and your only clue is an invitation in your pocket, beckoning you to visit Castle Red.</em></p><p><em>The castle is vast and empty, but there are a few others roaming the halls. Others like you, brought to the castle under mysterious circumstances. Each holding an invitation.</em></p><p><em>The worms are in the walls.</em></p><p><em>Praise be.</em></p><p>----</p><p>Castle Red is a Survival Horror game created with RPG Maker VX Ace. It is my first Ace project, and features a simple stealth system (the Trace Stealth System created for VX by Prof. Meow Meow, and converted to VXA by LiTTleDRAgo) and a lighting system (Khas Awesome Lighting Effects by Khas Arcthunder). Throughout the game you will explore a massive castle, solve puzzles, interact with various characters, evade monsters, and try to solve the mysteries of Castle Red.</p><p>Featuring a branching story with six possible endings!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35cc066553a350c5b8051ee9c861d6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LizardBite"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
