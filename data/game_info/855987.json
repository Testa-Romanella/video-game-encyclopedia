If you're of those this can trigger or unsettle, please refrain from playing the game.<br/>For some reason, if a new pictural asset and a new track are generated at the same time, the web version won't play the track unless you rollback: for this reason, it is advised to play the web version if, and only if you can't download the game. I'd also add that the issue didn't happen on mobile devices.<br/>Finally, lauching the web version might generate a Javascript error: I am alas no Javascript expert, but changing the browser often helps (I never had this issue on Firefox, but sometimes encountered it on Chrome).</p>\n<p><strong>SCENARIO</strong></p>\n<p>It's the story of Isaac and Elijah, who are dumb enough to date one month after meeting each other... Wait, no, wrong story...<br/>Or, maybe, it's the story of A\u00efcha meeting her racist, homophobic, but mostly dumb\u00a0parents-in-law and... still wrong, I think?????<br/>Well, it's the story of motherfucking Jasper who cries like a baby because he's going to have a baby and has unsolved daddy issues... Wait, we're nearing it...<br/>It's the story of Lumine Estern, who's cursed because one of her ancestors was an ass and... oh no, it's even worse<br/><br/>Well... what is this game about?<br/>It's a story about true love, about delicious meat, about social norms, about testicles, about... life, in the deepest way possible.<br/>A story to remind you that, whatever mistake you can make in life... remember I made a worse one.<br/>(it is a joke tho don't kill your baby and put it (should i use \"it\"?????) in the freezer, i think that's worse than a cringe game but that's just me lmao you do you)</p>\n<p>it was a legend of light. it was a legend of dark. it was the legend of Delta Rune. (what do you mean it isn't????)</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I brought Leonardo da Vinci back to life so that he could make art for this game but he sucks at digital art<br/>The worst art direction you've ever seen<br/>10 minutes of suffering<br/>CGs that will make your eyes bleed<br/>This should have been a spooktober submission at this point<br/>For the second time in one of my games, a giant talking slice of bacon.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>everything that isn't mentioned below: me, alas<br/>music:\u00a0dovasyndrome,\u00a0Darren Curtis, jojo's bizarre adventure, me<br/>sound effects:\u00a0zapsplat, except for the cooing; that's me</p>\n\n<p>(note: the donation thing is a joke, please don't give me your money, i don't want it)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c34f0d51257120f09f59ead5fa7995d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chimeriquement"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
