An engineer is sent to an abandoned, clandestine research facility and is tasked with decommissioning equipment and gathering research material left by scientists. As the engineer travels deeper into the void, they are thrust into an unstable world of phantasmagorical horrors. <br/></p>\n<p><em>\"A lot of games throw around the phrase \u201ccosmic horror\u201d nowadays, but few manage to deliver it as well as The Black Iris does. As soon as you step into the facility the atmosphere is electric and there\u2019s a real feeling of awe as you unravel the enormity of what\u2019s going on there. The retro styled visuals and vibrant purple-hued color palate are superb and the audio design is incredible. It\u2019s a mind-blowing experience. Highly recommended.\"</em> - AlphaBetaGamer</p>\n<ul><li>Explore a small open world in a play time of around 20-30 minutes</li><li>This game contains flashing lights</li><li>Content warning: One instance of body horror, unsettling sound design</li><li>Soundtrack version available for $4.00 (Gives access to the game + 4 Tracks)</li><li>Controls:<ul><li>WASD = Move</li><li>E = Interact</li><li>T = Toggle torch</li><li>TAB = Menu/Inventory/Objectives</li><li>ESC/P = Pause</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>All proceeds from this game (after the standard 10% revenue share with itch.io) will go to West Dunbartonshire Community Foodback.
