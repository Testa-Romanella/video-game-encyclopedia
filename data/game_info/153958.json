Compose as precisely as possible - no crotchet or quaver can go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>The dot marked with white at the top of the screen\u00a0shows the 'instrument' that you have selected. The white box moving across the screen shows you where the current musical 'beat' is.</p>\n<p>By pressing the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong> arrow key, you change the selected instrument. By pressing <strong>space</strong>, the instrument starts playing at the current beat, and the coloured boxes show the notes of the instrument. To pass the level, you have to have all the instruments be playing at the same time, but without any of their notes overlapping.</p>\n<p>Best played in an up to date Firefox or Chrome.
