In his attempt to get to work faster he went through the Kuiper Zone of the Solar System K2-72e (also known as Earth's Solar System).   </p>\n<p>A trivial route for any Alien Archaeology Professor, but our dear Mark was too occupied texting while enjoying his hot Vilf\u00f8vlin Grande beverage from Planetbucks and didn't noticed the icy rocks up ahead!! (Icy Rock being like: \u201cOh hi Mark!\u201d)\r\n </p>\n<p>A terrible crash almost spilled the beverage of Mark, but thankfully his 10 arms managed to save the drink, finish the text he was writing, turn his driving seat back up and maneuver to avoid any more rocks!\r\n </p>\n<p>His space-car crashed to a deserted unnamed planet which Mark had a strong feeling that it could be called Earth, or something like that.\r\n </p>\n<p>Earth was filled with water, it was believed though that it wasn't always like this. Forrest and deserts were filled across lands that were above water and all the water that is now occupying the whole planet was trapped in huge ice mountains. Due to climate change though temperature rose and the ice went back being just plain water.\r\n </p>\n<p>Now Mark has to survive and repair his car while exploring this planet. Who knows he might even find some traces of ancient civilization! That would certainly be a pay raise!\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is a survival 2D sandbox with procedurally generated world. You can collect materials\u00a0by mining the world and create food, your base , discover and learn the cultural heritage of Earth and eventually repair your spaceship to return back to your planet and share all the incredible and terrible things humans did while occupying Earth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Learn and share the human history and culture. Study and find possible reasons why Earth and humanity was destroyed and try to avoid their mistakes.<br/></p><p><strong>Future goals</strong>:\u00a0</p><ul><li>Player character as Mark.</li><li>Map filled with water and be able to swim.</li><li>NPC fish that player could interact, kill and eat.</li><li>Base creation.</li><li>Lore.</li><li>Spaceship repair.</li><li>Tools, Gear and Upgrades.</li><li>Life/Stamina/02</li><li>Human Cities</li><li>End Game.</li></ul><p>PS: I was one man army so without designer and music engineer I could only use royalty free assets.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:41:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42dfdd5f7098ce1302d2dc43c98097e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ikiaras"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
