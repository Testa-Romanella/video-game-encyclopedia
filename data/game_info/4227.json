The princess is blind to the various dangers and pitfalls of the castle and will continue to move forward -- potentially to her doom-- if our hero doesn't do something! Upon coiffing down a magical blue elixir, Dokuro gains the ability to transform into a swashbuckling hero. This noble form allows him to save the day and simultaneously catch the eye of the otherwise unaware princess. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPush, pull, jump and toggle to solve unique and increasingly difficult puzzles. Handle inhospitable situations with the power of the almighty chalk! Different colors of chalk allow our little bonehead to draw lines of flame, create great bodies of water, and repair broken ropes.
