If you fail a level you'll get the option to retry it, and if you succeed you can move on to the next difficulty.</p>\n<p>This game is written in Clojure using Quil which is a library for creating interactive drawings and animations. For the most part it is pure functional Clojure code with a little bit of mutability scattered around to control the threads responsible for playing music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>The souce for the game is on Github here, feel free to have a look.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>- Arrow keys to control the speed and direction of your ship.</p>\n<p>- Spacebar to fire your cannons when the yellow bar is full.</p><p>- Esc to pause the game and return to the menu.</p>\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\n<p>https://0x72.itch.io/pixeldudesmaker<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-wooden-ship-tiles<br/>https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad1348d38cb0aa2c60f70d064526365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kimbsy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
