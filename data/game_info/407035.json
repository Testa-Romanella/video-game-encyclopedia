Upgrades with higher fire rate and damage.</li><li>Area weapon - damages all enemies in a radius around the tower. Upgrades with higher fire rate and damage.</li><li>Beam weapon - Shoots a beam all across the map, but can only target enemies that are close. Upgrades with longer duration and more damage per tick.</li></ul>\n<p>Effects:</p>\n<ul><li>Burn effect - damages enemies over time. Upgrades with more damage and duration.</li><li>Slow effect - slows enemies. Upgrades with higher slow percentage and duration.</li><li>Tesla effect - bounces lightning to a maximum number of nearby enemies (only applicable to the project weapon). Upgrades with more damage and more bounces.</li></ul>\n<p>The game is purely controlled with the mouse.<br/>Drag items from the inventory into the 3x3 crafting grid so that they match one of the recipes from the recipe book. Once a recipe has successfully been crafted you can either drag the result onto one of the towers if is an effect or a weapon, or just drag it out of the result box if it is a tower or wall, to add it to your object placement menu.<br/>Note that effects can only be used on towers with weapons and one tower can have a maximum of two weapons.<br/>Dragging an effect or weapon onto a tower which already has that effect or weapon equipped will upgrade that instance of the effect or weapon.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:13:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b516c907aa861c1ff6e653916d75bd7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jasninus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
