It wasn&#39;t very reliable to begin with, since tapes and tape recorders varied greatly in quality and compatibility. If not stored properly, tapes have a tendency to degrade over time, especially if left near strong magnetic/electric fields (like cathode monitors/TVs, speakers, children, power sources, power plants, EMP bombs, any kind of star, ...). Sometimes, some of the data can still be recovered even after decades of mistreatment.</p>\n<p>Tape Recovery Simulator 96K builds new game mechanics around old data recovery tricks.
