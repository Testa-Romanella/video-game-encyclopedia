I only had February of 2022 to work on it, and then I would be done, no matter the state of the game. <br/></p>\n<p>I did this to teach myself how to finish something. I've been watching a lot of dev talks, there's a lot of free ones on youtube, and they almost always say the same thing: that finishing just one project is going to teach you exponentially more than starting several. <br/></p>\n<p>There are a million things I don't like about this game.\u00a0But I finished it, and I'm going to call it done. Is it good? Wwweeeeeellllll.... But it's done.</p><p>So I can't say I learned how to finish a good game. But I did learn a few things, mostly\u00a0about that saying \"perfection is the enemy of progress\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>So now I can return to my larger project with what I've learned. I'm humbled, I think is the best word for it. I'm not some goddess who can do everything perfect the first try. At the same time, I can't let myself chase \"perfection\" by giving the same project piece a sixth, seventh, eighth try. I need to know when to stop. But I am me, and I can still make art. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T08:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa6/aa6c64afab31719d8b589d3685352788.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BikkuriBunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
