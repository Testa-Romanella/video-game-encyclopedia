That's right I'd owe this darn description box text!</p><p>This is a simple Schmup with the goal of getting a fat score for bragging rights, into your score are accounted your kills and your accuracy! The game'll tell you the controls when you start it up and you can get right on some blue extermination.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway,<strong> E.S.G</strong>, is the first game I ever made. You shoot aliens forever until they die or you die and since the blue alien race has very <em>very</em> <strong>very</strong> fertile<strong>\u00a0</strong>\u00a0mothers you'll go out before they stop coming, but hey, dying's a good way to spend your time.</p>\n<p>All graphics (AAA quality I know) as well as sound effects, music, programming and debug-time swearing where made by myself. Using the Duality 2d engine, sunvox and pyxel edit.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you have a nice time playing the bugger cause I had a nice time buggin - I mean making it. :D \u00a0And you can always check out my devblog on wordpress which the last time it was updated I was probably still a fetus or something, for future updates on my gamedeving shenanigans I deem not shameful enough to bury deep in my filesystem.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun ;)</p>\n<p>Oh and here's the soundtrack if amateur chiptunes are your thing.
