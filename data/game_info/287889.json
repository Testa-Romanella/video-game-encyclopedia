At times the size of your support group may be reduced, but you'll always be able to build it back up again.\u00a0</p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>Sam Berube - Art &amp; Level Design</li><li>Jim Leedham - Programming</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0cf95df796343100cfac44444b43910.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jim Leedham"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
