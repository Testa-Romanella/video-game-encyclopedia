The ability to set quick respawn points at any time means repeating frustrating sections is never required.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Feel Good</strong><br/>Dash into walls that reflect you. It feels really good and looks awesome!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Did I mention there are no platforms?</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Reactive Soundscape</strong><br/>A highly reactive and dynamic soundtrack thanks to Ynglet's custom and needlessly complicated music software.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Doodles for days</strong><br/>The hand-drawn art style takes a fresh \u2018illustrated\u2019 approach, reminiscent of expressive doodles come to life. There\u2019s lots of unusual creatures doing their own thing, making the world feel alive.<br/><br/><br/>I have made a lot of other games before like Knytt, Uurnog, and Affordable Space Adventures but I really hope you will like this game too!\" / Nifflas", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T04:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/683/6831fcf57c6d6d8a04d23c5678dd07ea.jpg", "website": "https://www.ynglet.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 14}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nifflas"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Triple Topping"], "esrb_rating": null}
