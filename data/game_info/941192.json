Its very simple. Choose your fear, diving to the depths of the deep ocean or flying amount the stars in outer space.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal is to answer a series of questions correctly. Each round has a random number of questions, random types of questions and a random percentage to win.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The fun part is when the questions start. There is a balance of questions (Factual Trivia questions and controversial math equations.) The two data sets differ in contrast since the trivia questions are factual and are being sourced from an API. The math equations, depending on where you are in the world, are a series of order of operations questions and there could be multiple answers. These math equations are also being sources from a static list verse and API.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you win the trivia round, you will go to the environment you fear (Deep sea or outer space) but it will be peaceful and you have nothing to worry about. On the other hand, if you lose the trivia round, you will go to to the environment you fear and it will be scary.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Project details</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unity 2021.3.16F1\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset References:\r\n</p>\n<p>Underwater FX - https://unityassetcollection.com/underwater-fx-free-download/\r\n</p>\n<p>Lunar-https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/lunar-landscape-3d-132614\r\n</p>\n<p>Island-https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/free-island-collection-104753\r\n</p>\n<p>FreebeeSkyboxes-https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-free-103633\r\n</p>\n<p>GalaxyFire skybox - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/galaxy-fire-skybox-10976\r\n</p>\n<p>Simple BOIDS - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/simple-boids-flocks-of-birds-fish-and-insects-164188\r\n</p>\n<p>Island music \u2192 https://pixabay.com/music/beats-fashion-chill-11950/\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Scary music \u2192 https://pixabay.com/music/suspense-dark-mystery-trailer-taking-our-time-131566/\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Happy Music \u2192 https://pixabay.com/music/beautiful-plays-natural-landscape-117483/\r\n</p>\n<p>Ocean Happy Music \u2192 https://pixabay.com/music/beats-ocean-of-inspiration-132404/\r\n</p>\n<p>Ocean Scary Music \u2192https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-dark-ambient-atmosphere-2-141314/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>API References:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Trivia API - https://the-trivia-api.com/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Publis Repo</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://github.com/VyperAD8XR/Hackathon\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a2b7588a8173bbed294719a2775867c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cymboldesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
