Finally she stopped in frustration and smiled, then dropped the marker, sigh\u00a0and went on with her plan to tell the children a story that would make them never to be the same again... A story that even I am not sure was real or not... But it was one of the most unimaginable story ever... Well I guess it was a story that why so many things were possible.</p>\n<p>The title of her story was called World 001, she called it the early days of earth \ud83c\udf0d, what actually took place before they were able to live a peaceful life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She went forward into telling them how a man saved the future of thir world...
