It's just a simple game made in Unity,\u00a0all of the art and sounds were free assets, except a few sprites that I modified.\u00a0I made this game to practice some skills and to try implementing some things that I haven't used before. It's far from perfect, there might be a few buggy mechanics, and the menus are pretty meh, but they work.</p>\n<p>Anyways give it a play and let me know what you think. Hope you enjoy it, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/937125502e2aa4e63df6d24a69dd7b99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DewFiend"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
