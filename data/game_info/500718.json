My first ever entry to Ludum Dare is here!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lore</p>\n<p>Your spacecraft has been damaged during space dogfight and you're drifting for asteroid belt. Your fighter reactor can only support plasma shielding, however it is unstable. Your shielding decreases it's radius every second before reactor can pulsate again in it's looping phase. Will you survive until the fleet found you?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game\u00a0</p>\n<p>Point at any targets with your shield to disintegrate them. Look out for\u00a0 blocks, as they can damage your aircraft. Collect other blocks with your aircraft.\u00a0 \u00a0(Health) Block regenerates health of your aircraft while\u00a0 (Buff) makes your reactor reimpulse and regenerate full shielding. You can destroy those block with your shields as well, but you will get less points for doing so, and no bonuses of course.</p>\n<p>Objective</p>\n<p>Survive as long as possible, until Fleet(R) can find you.</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ec/0ec4816ba85edbccf37b60e8ed193802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mkpietrzyk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
