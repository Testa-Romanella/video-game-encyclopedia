Through the narrative the viewer not only has ability to observer the memory, but must follow an alternative path that fundamentally changes what happened and as a result brings the protagonist to a healing moment. The Key was designed specifically for the HTC Vive as it takes advantage of the headset rooms scale technology in a unique way, as the viewer must physically interact with the environment in order to progress the story. The experience also utilises photogrammetry to build environments and Depthkit to capture real performances that are then composited in the experience.  The result is a very convincing and engaging interactive narrative.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92bc7c4dca1e9fdf6385b58378a8a9a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cinehackers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
