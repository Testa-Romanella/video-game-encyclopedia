Plant lover and child of the island, the little rascal has become entangled with that of a great evil spirit. Together they must feed the volcano to cause an eruption and release the local deity Yaphett.</strong><br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to collect and sacrifice souls into the big volcano at the center of the island until the volcano erupts!<br/><br/>Blast your way through hordes of procedurally generated parties of hostile creatures including rat people, imps, humans, ghosts, and more.<br/><br/>Avoid the attention of local deities as you progress through different areas of the Pluto's Island collecting souls. They can cut your adventure short if you're causing too much of a ruckus.<br/><br/>Customize and experiment with combinations of abilities that souls grant. Before sacrificing them into the volcano and beginning a new day, you can use them to progress further into the game.<br/><br/>Nurse potted plants, relax, and decorate Pluto's cozy bedroom. There are rewards for taking good care of your plants!<br/><br/>Solve platforming puzzles for bonus rewards. The majority of these puzzles are only accessible through a gateway that has a chance to appear randomly while playing!<br/><br/>Interact with hand painted NPCs you can choose to help them solve whatever issues they may present or harvest their souls and chuck them into the volcano too!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T05:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86e15ec6fc07ec5bed25a003aa7e14f.jpg", "website": "http://www.ratswamp.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valentino Quijano-Moeckel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Valentino Quijano-Moeckel"], "esrb_rating": null}
