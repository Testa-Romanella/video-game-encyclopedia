In this game, the player wakes up in a post-apocalyptic garden with a lot of creatures and plants! You are free to explore around, gather resources, and get to know the magic that is left behind the world that was destroyed. The player is able to pick up stuff from the environment and interact with it! (eat it, wear it, or use it somehow). Sometimes you will run into obstacles like rocks and rats, you must find your way out!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>WASD: move camera\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow Up &amp; Down : arrange inventory\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse Click: move avatar\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q : Eat</p>\n<p>R: Wear</p>\n<p>Space: Use\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T06:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a2743e4a4467bea14320a7bb2a40e834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["soupsouppp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
