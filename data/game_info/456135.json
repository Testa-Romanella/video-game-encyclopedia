The theme of the Game Jam was \"surprise\", \"sorpresa\" in Spanish. Since \"sor\" means \"sister\" (like you would adress a nun) and \"presa\" means prisoner/inmate, we decided to make the game about a nun in jail.</p>\n<p>In Asun, you'll need to bounce off the holy ball around the prison's courtyard using your cross. Everytime you hit it, it will go faster, but will also slow down with each bounce off a wall. The faster it goes, the more points you'll get! See how far you can make it!</p><p>Developed by Lucas Garc\u00eda, Lori\u00e9n Portella, Jaume Sur\u00eds and Joel Cabaco.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:29:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9af687bc8e03a258e5a5f9f4298a2bec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dynamic.cast"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
