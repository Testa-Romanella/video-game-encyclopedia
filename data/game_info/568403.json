Thanks for downloading and taking the time to play Switch It Up! Switch It Up! Was made for the 3rd Wowiee game jam hosted by Jonas Tyroller, and is the first jam I have participated in (also my first game). The theme was: Failure is progress, and I interpreted it by making a platformer that you have to die to progress. Have fun! (All code, assets, and music were all made by myself in the 72 hour time limit)<br/></p><p>- Made with GDvelop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:47:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c046ebf7e1c8fdbf9b13467194d7690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GoldenMan12321"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
