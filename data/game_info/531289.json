This game is not an accurate representation but a fun thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FIRE AND FREEZE is about when the Germans tried to invade Moscow. The harsh cold climate make it almost impossible for the Germans to continue the invasion. The Russians also used katyushas which are rockets that are massed produced during the reign of the Soviet Union. This rockets, despite of their inaccuracy, give fear to the enemies because of its howling sound adding up to the psychological warfare, the Germans nicknamed this as \"Stalin's organ\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please point out any bugs or crap in the game so I could fix it.
