This was my first attempt at an exterior environment, and my first time to experiment with unity's tree and terrain editors. Additionally, I got to play around with some sound and a wind zone. I even added a script for a flashlight (activated by pressing \"F\") that slowly fades as you use it, and recharges when not in use. I'd say the flashlight was my biggest achievement in this level.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are also some assorted screenshots from my cemetery environment. These showcase the flashlight and the centerpieces of the environment, the gravestones, dead tree, and crypts.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, there's a \r\n\tvideo of the flashlight in the cemetery I made, since it doesn't work properly in the web demo due to reduced quality. The flashlight works in the executable file.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Note: All textures are from Textures.com, and all sounds are from FreeSound.org.</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYear of production: Fall 2014\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f91b572318b76247bd8dc58b229e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["S.
