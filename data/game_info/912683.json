Any feedback you can give me would be great! the game is also on steam for free if youd like to play through the current build of the game thats available.

You can play with the momentum of your dash to do interesting things.<br/></p><p>Bounce Pads spend your jumps but you can dash with them to gain extra height or distance if done correctly</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fdd305aaa7c1d4b6eff791032d03e98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AaronFry"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
