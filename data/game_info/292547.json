This means:</p>\n<p>- There is no sound what so ever.</p>\n<p>- Functionality is bare-bones. I apologise for the player control system; its the default unity one. In addition, it was intended for you to have a gravity gun esque device to manipulate the environment with.\u00a0 That isn't here, but you can still pick up and move things, and shoot buttons at a distance, as if you had it.</p>\n<p>- There is a distinct point where the art budget ran out, so to speak. We were given 4 weeks to design and build the 'grey box' of the level, and 2 weeks to art it up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- There are no menus in the game. To exit, you must Alt+F4 it.</p>\n<p>If these don't put you off, feel free to give it a try. I have upload it here mainly so it exists in a public space, where I can point people to it if they ask.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/5246762b20540ab93fd0b85094201e01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel D'Onofrio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
