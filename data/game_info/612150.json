FLASHING LIGHTS!--</em></strong></p>\n<p>A routine mission goes haywire as an attack of unprecedented scale by the Luftwaffe annihilates your squadron. Now, it's up to you to bring this threat down, once and for all, with only your skills as a pilot, and your limitless reserves of machine gun ammo. But beware! The enemy has the power of the occult on their side, and there's no telling where they'll drag you, or who you'll fight, so brace yourself and give them hell!</p>\n<p>This is an old school project game I've decided to update and place online for any who would be interested. The game is coded in Processing 3 (So, Java. And it's open-source!). I hope you enjoy it for what it is should you choose to play it.</p>\n<p><em>~ W.T.L</em></p>\n\n<p><em>ADDITIONAL GAME CREDITS:</em></p>\n<p>\"Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Confederate Air Force\" by Gary Lee Todd, Ph.D. is marked under CC0 1.0.</p>\n<p>\"2017-108-01\" by Community Archives of Belleville &amp; Hastings County is marked with CC0 1.0.</p>\n<p>\"Lockheed P-38 Lightening, Confederate Air Force\" by Gary Lee Todd, Ph.D. is marked with CC0 1.0.</p>\n<p>To view the terms, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/cc0/1.0</p>\n<p>The music tracks used in-game are\u00a0are royalty-free, and created by\u00a0Patrick de Arteaga.
