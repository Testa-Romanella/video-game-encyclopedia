This was my first game jam, and I\u00a0think I\u00a0definitely bit off a bit more than I could chew. I\u00a0was pretty strapped for time, so I\u00a0didn't have time to make any decent looking game graphics of my own other than the menus and such. I plan on improving this game in the future. This is just a prototype. After all, that's what game jams are for.\u00a0Thanks\u00a0 for checking out the game.</p>\n<p>Programming by me<br/>Game assets borrowed from https://www.kenney.nl/<br/>Music from https://www.bensound.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d42f3fa2498bedef9e5c0026c5edd983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
