It was inspired by the jam's theme, \"Out of Control,\" with a mind-bending and constantly-changing control scheme. You are in possession of a magic vessel (beer glass) that grants incredible power, but in exchange you lose nearly all muscular coordination. It will take extreme concentration to bumble your way out of this nightmare.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Mark Brown of GMTK for running this jam, and Itch.io for hosting.</p><p>Concept, Programming &amp; Art by: Sam Balcomb<br/>Sound Design, Music &amp; Testing by: Jeff Dodson<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5b/b5b1182bf4a40bea6e23d742122bad44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Element Mill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
