{"id": 124778, "slug": "strobemotion-playtest-1", "name": "StrobeMotion Playtest 1", "name_original": "StrobeMotion Playtest 1", "description": "<p>Providing locomotion in VR is an on-going challenge. There's no solution that pleases everyone: Games that release with teleportation only are swamped with demands for trackpad movement, while games that only offer trackpad movement lose the ~30% of players prone to motion sickness.</p>\n<p>I'm working on developing a unique new VR locomotion system that will bridge the gap between trackpad movement and teleportation, which I'm calling StrobeMotion. The goal of StrobeMotion is to provide the most naturalistic motion possible while maintaining a comfortable experience for all players.</p>\n<p>And it works! Well... It works for the two people who have tried it, anyway. To get meaningful results, I need a lot more people to try it.</p>\n<p>I'm looking for people to playtest a short demo level I've built. All you have to do is traverse the level a couple times using the current pre-alpha prototype of StrobeMotion on a couple different settings, then answer a few questions about your comfort levels in an embedded survey. Easy as pie, and it should only take around 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to help, please click the button below to download the playtest level. (This initial test build only supports HTC Vive on Windows. Also, this playtest is <strong>not recommended</strong> for anyone with health conditions sensitive to flashing images.)</p>\n<p>After you finish the playtest, if you have any additional feedback you feel like sharing beyond what the survey covers, of course I'd love to hear it. Feel free to post comments below.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hengeworks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
