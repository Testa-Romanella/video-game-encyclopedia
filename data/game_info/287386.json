You will control a futuristic hovercraft trying to be the first to find the Golden Orb. If the Golden Orb is not found within the time limit, the team with the most points wins. Points are earned by collecting White Orbs which you return to your teams portal or by hitting Green Orbs which provide an instant point. Be careful though, crash too fast and you'll blow up!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b146e7d0f6b645cfb2289f6ddcd1f3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simpli Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Simpli Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
