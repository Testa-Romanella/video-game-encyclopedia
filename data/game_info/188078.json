All systems are failing and your only chance is to keep the ship fission reactor working so the escape ship can be charged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that's not all: the radars have detected another missile coming at your ship. You will have to carefully manage the damaged ship reactor to make it produce as much energy as you can in the limited time you have.</p>\n<p>Be careful though, if the core overheats too much, it will explode.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Move around with WASD keys, run with shift. Pay attention to the failures, and fix them as soon as you can. You can regulate the reactivity level of the core in the core control room. A more reactive core produces more energy, but overheats faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/3812846fe9e6dc29b710551cdbcefaae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magic Workshop"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
