Be careful not to crash or go out of bounds.</p><p>The missiles navigate by calculating the cross product of the velocity vector and the direction vector, then using the signage z coordinate of the resultant vector to determine which way to turn. Additionally, to avoid collision with obstacles and other missiles, when an object enters a trigger collider it gets added to a list and the shortest vector to the object in question is calculated. The missile then determines the optimal path to avoid the obstacles in the list, until they are out of range and they are removed. The missile's turn speed is somewhat low compared to the forward speed so that they do not have perfect object avoidance as part of the fun of the game is getting them to crash into each other or the barriers. Additionally, I originally considered allowing the missiles to slow down to decrease their turn radius but that went against the purpose of the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To Do:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Bug Fixes</li><li>Add sound effects and music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1253e07b515fc04ccb980a2b1a8d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tfrederick1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
