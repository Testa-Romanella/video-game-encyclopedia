YOUR GOAL is to remove the red pieces as they show up by sliding them into white pieces.<br/>Higher white pieces will destroy lower red pieces.<br/>Lower white pieces will reduce the rank of red pieces.<br/>Sliding two pieces of the same color and number together will increase their value by 1. Whenever a red piece slides into a wall, it chips away at it. Once a wall piece is gone, red pieces can slide out and escape, losing you the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:16:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16f344569ea5f391c2ba17862046865.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tangledrealitystudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
