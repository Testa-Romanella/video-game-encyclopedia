So, I decided to do something I usually don\u2019t do, focus much more on art, music, and polish. Making it is the most fun I\u2019ve had in a Ludum Dare thus far. I completed this game in around 8 hours.</p>\n<p>The premise is simple, finish as many drinks as you can before the bartender cuts you off. The more you drink, the harder it is to grab the next drink off the bar. The bartender is constantly judging you. Each time you grab and miss the bottle, he will get closer to cutting you off. When you\u2019ve finally had more than you can handle, the game ends, and you can see the final tally of how many drinks you consumed.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0<strong>MOVE</strong>\u00a0- WASD or Arrow Keys\r\n\u00a0\u00a0<strong>GRAB</strong>\u00a0- Space or Enter\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/248/248ca077f5d8acd094c02aeab178dc97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
