This event turned innocent humans into demons, encantos, and other monsters as the spirits need a vessel to live on Earth. The extinction of humanity was approaching until an albularyo, a man knowledgeable on herb medicine, saved them. He provides them with shelter, food, and protection. He becomes their light in the darkness. But that's what they knew... the albularyo offered the monsters to feed them by killing those whom he saved in exchange for his life being spared. Every night the Albularyo runs his cariton to serve the monsters.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9db18f411721ca8b3d92bf2576800466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SADARA Game Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
