{"id": 516485, "slug": "dinky-king", "name": "Dinky King", "name_original": "Dinky King", "description": "<p>CONTROLS:\r\nX - start the game, or jump\r\nZ - swing the scepter if you have it\r\nArrows - walk left and right, or climb up and down ladders</p>\n<p>This is Dinky King, my homage to the original Donkey Kong arcade. You are the Dinky King! You must save the Queen from the Jealous Jester. Walk and climb with the arrow keys, and jump with X (x)! If you find the King's magic scepter, press O (z) to whack the Jester's balls right back at him! Or, just jump over the balls. The Queen dropped her stuff! Make sure to grab it for her on the way. Arrest that Jester! And if you can...topple him to his doom in the last level. Difficulty increases slightly each time you complete all four levels.</p>\n<p>Nothin' fancy, just a cute little homage.</p>\n<p>Oh, and watch out for SOCK PUPPETS.</p>\n<p>The music is a transcription of a riff from Yancey Stomp, by Jimmy Yancey. It's a great song, check it out here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/c4eQbeuX2Y0</p>\n<p>Changelog:\r\n6-9-20 (4th update today!): A couple more small tweaks, stop slinkies when winning level 2</p>\n<p>6-9-20 (3rd update today!): Make sure flr is used for all calculations based on dif so timers don't skip the 0 condition. Make the highest difficulty level slightly easier so it is actually doable. (takes 8 times through all four levels...can you make it there???)</p>\n<p>6-9-20 (2nd update today!): Make slinkies far less aggressive when first playing level 2, but make them respond to the difficulty setting so over time if you keep completing all 4 levels they will pick up speed.</p>\n<p>6-9-20: Increase delay before sock puppets enter. Decrease volume of ladder and slinky sfx. Add press X message to title screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/779cdb9ab3d1d9f2607688e78a9e862a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gradualgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
