This game is basically an interactive logo I made for folks to play at our info table on the day of the event.

You are encouraged to fall into the abyss between the letters, which adds your soul to the asteroid field. By the end of the day I hope to have collected hundreds of souls.</p><p>you can visit playdategameshow.com for the full list of games this year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c945c271ed23d668a8be2a896305849a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bela"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
