You play as the circles and the computer as the crosses. Computer is smart, but will sometimes slip up. Take the chance! Once in the result screen, click the spinning coin to play again.</p>\n<p>Originally a boring UI based game. I added 3D models and animations mid development, mainly as an excuse to model everything and try my hand at making things look nice.</p>\n<p>The AI sometimes played dumb because the computer player always went first. A perfect player\u00a0in this situation would never lose, only win or draw. I deemed this lame and introduced a coin toss to decide who goes first before every round, and ended up leaving the playing dumb part.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T08:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ba/1ba8bab90e68045593a5032a0d768629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Kalto-Mate"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
