{"id": 96435, "slug": "and-now-the-weather", "name": "And now, The Weather.", "name_original": "And now, The Weather.", "description": "<p>'And Now, The Weather' is a game about British weather, British apathy, and the British penchant for overreaction in the face of minor inconvenience.<br/><br/>Created for the Develop 2016 Game Jam by Oli Carson (@OhCarson) Jim Scull (@JimScull) Bianca Iancu (@voraptor) and Jack Gill (@Jack_Gill_SGS) 'And Now, The Weather' combines god-like weather control powers with pithy, self-indulgent, randomly generated newsflashes to create something not quite like any game before. Any good game that is.<br/><br/>The game was built in Unity over the space of about 24 hours, with its creators working tirelessly, at times in the lobby of their hostel, and at times inside a locked room they weren't supposed to be in, in a hotel that can't be named.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to spread apathy throughout the UK, by clicking and dragging your three suns and three rainclouds to move them from region to region. If a region is becoming too sad (blue) then sending a sun to it will help to cheer it up. If a region is becoming too happy (yellow) then sending a bit of good old fashioned British drizzle should soon dampen those spirits.<br/><br/>As the god of British weather, fight to preserve a sense of disinterest and half-hearted disgruntlement in the scepter'd isle that started it all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2b5b69c4f59df8d19ae963d09f37722.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ocarson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
