{"id": 739791, "slug": "teamkill", "name": "Teamkill", "name_original": "Teamkill", "description": "<strong>Teamkill</strong> is a multiplayer arena shooter where shooting enemies makes them your friend!<br/><br/>Inspired by the legendary <strong>instagib</strong> mode from classics such as Quake and Unreal Tournament as well as the <strong>infection</strong> mode found in countless others, Teamkill is a fast-paced shooter where every shot counts, because hitting your enemies converts them to your team. Teamkill combines arena-shooter instagib style combat with the tension of infection! <br/><br/>Every match starts as a free for all, and just one good hit can turn the tides in (or against) your favor. Any match can switch from a big team battle to an infection-style hunt for the last man standing in a matter of seconds<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> <h3> Co-op..etitive? Gameplay </h3>Experience the unique challenges a free-for-all-turned-team-deathmatch style game brings, where all it takes is one good shot to turn an all-on-one into <strong>your</strong> victory. On the flipside, show them that getting converted to someone else's team doesn't mean things are over, as you work your way to the top of the charts by <strong>out-gunning, out-strafing and out-bunnyhopping</strong> the competition!<br/><br/></li><li> <h3> Community Content Support </h3>Import<strong> your own maps</strong> into the game using publicly available tools, then play them with your friends through <strong>Steam Workshop!</strong><br/><br/></li><li>  Full set of voice acting featuring <strong>Gianni Matragrano</strong> Witness the man, the myth, the legend,<strong> Gianni Matragrano</strong> play both the <strong>in-game announcer</strong> and <strong>Teamguy</strong> with over 100 recorded voice lines!<br/><br/></li><li> Soundtrack by animator, composer, game developer (plus voice actor) <strong>CoreyLaddo</strong> Enjoy an all-new synth-y original soundtrack amidst the carnage of railgun fire and \"Cope, Seethe, Mald\"-ing Teamguys, composed by the real <strong>CoreyLaddo!</strong><br/><br/></li><li> <h3>Multiple Gamemodes </h3>If the standard \"Free For All\"-\"Team Deathmatch\" hybrid <strong>Teamkill mode</strong> isn't doing it for you, try the (slightly) more traditional <strong>Team Teamkill</strong> before swapping over to some <strong> Hide &amp; Seek!</strong><br/><br/></li><li> <h3> Customization Options </h3>Show off your creativity and advanced vocabulary by personalizing your team with a custom name, and a color! While you're at it, why not <strong>customize the game modes</strong> too?
