{"id": 22091, "slug": "spiritlands", "name": "Spiritlands", "name_original": "Spiritlands", "description": "<strong>Spiritlands is a 4X casual resource and people management game in which you create or generate lands of over 3000 isometric tiles and build a populous from campfire to teeming city, from collecting resources, to building and assigning hundreds of workers to a variety of roles including farmers, explorers, and soldiers!<br/><br/>The game pits you against a changing and challenging world- only this time you are it's creator! With hundreds of thousands of possibilities, from desert lands, to waste lands, each world you create changes your gameplay. Explore your world with generated ruins and enemy camps, as you discover, research, and fight to improve and protect your people as you grow.</strong><br/><br/><br/>The story:<br/>Humanity has become consumed with greed. While some grow richer, others are starving. Riots have dismantled many of the world governments, and people seek refuse from the chaos and carnage that now plagues the Earth.<br/>\u200b<br/>In an attempt to free yourself from damnation, you branched out on your own path to the fabled eighth continent, hundreds of miles from the shores of any established country.<br/>\u200b<br/>Few had dared to travel across the sea into the mist- with tales of lost ships and ancient wars that once destroyed the Spiritlands.<br/>For you however, the danger draws you in... the mysteries, the colonies, the freedom to create and do as you desire.<br/>\u200b<br/>You dream of making your own civilisation, to start again! Through blood, wealth, or discovery you will rise with your people, from the wood of the forests, to the iron from the mountains, the Spiritlands will become your home.<br/><br/><br/>The goal:<br/><br/>Spiritlands is a game about possibility and survival. The goal is open-ended, to establish as many settlements you want, with as much population or size as you want. <br/>You might want to create masses of resource guzzling cities with skyscrapers and tarmac roads that tear down the nature that once was there. Or you might want to make hamlets and towns, each producing different goods that share across your civilisation, preserving the nature as sources of happiness. Either is possible- and so is anything in between! Your lands are yours to build up as you please. The end goal is to look at what you have made and feel proud of it.<br/><br/>The people:<br/>\u200b<br/>Your people need 5 things:<br/>- Water<br/>- Power<br/>- Happiness<br/>- Food<br/>- Shelter<br/><br/>Your people are your explorers, workers and soldiers- they fuel your growth and are specific to the settlement they are in.<br/><br/><br/>Resources:<br/><br/>Resources are the corner stone for each settlement that you control. Resources fuel buildings and your people, from feeding them to training them. In the early game, you can click or click-hover over tiles to collect their resources. As a leader you make the first buildings in your Capital. Soon after your resources become automated as you create farms, lumbermills, quarries, mine, and fishing areas and assign your people as needed.<br/>\u200b<br/>Each resource has a rate create by consumption of your automation. You must keep resources in the positive to <br/>survive.<br/>\u200b<br/>Main resources:<br/>- Food<br/>- Wood<br/>- Stone<br/>- Coal.<br/><br/><br/>Exploration:<br/><br/>Spiritlands definitely isn't a game about staying in one area with one settlement. You are encourages to explore, carefully. Placing campfires, you break through the fog the of the lands, uncovering old ruins that you can tell your people to explore for loot chests. You can also uncover colonies that you can trade or fight with.<br/>\u200b<br/>There are also enemy encampments of different sizes, who will attack your settlements if you are large enough to be noticed. You can also attack them. Exploring uncovers more lands, more resource tiles, and more opportunities!<br/><br/><br/>Colonies:<br/><br/>There are 4 colonies across your lands:<br/>The Port Keepers- they run a harbour with ships that create food.<br/>\u200bThe Woodlanders- they run lumbermills for wood.<br/>The Stonecutters- they live in the hills mining stone.<br/>The Miners- who live in the mountains and trade coal.<br/>\u200b<br/>Each colony can be traded with at your markets. Once discovered you can befriend them by trading with them the resources that they need, so that they can build and eventually provide you with freebees! Anger them through attacks though and they will hunt your people.<br/><br/><br/>Combat:<br/><br/>Whether you are fighting encampments or waging wars on colonies- combat is a necessary part of expanding. By building attack barracks, you can create a collective army of soldiers to use as you wish. They are trained purely in attack, and can be researched to be made stronger. Sometimes you will come under attack, especially if you leave an enemy encampment alone for too long. So you need defences...<br/>\u200b<br/>Everywhere has a viewable defence score. Attacks will centre on one of your buildings, but will damage the surrounding area. You can build walls to increase your score, as well as creating defensive barracks or watch towers and posting soldiers.<br/><br/><br/>Research (a work in progress!)<br/>\u200b<br/>Research comes in 3 paths:<br/>\u200b<br/>1) The Discoverers -<br/>Discoverers seek peaceful routes to knowledge, unvailing the world and the secrets in it is their goal, while preserving the natural landscape around them.<br/>2) The Evolutionists - <br/>Evolutionists pursue prosperity and growth. They want to control vast areas with masses of resources and highly developed land.<br/>3) The Conquerors -<br/>Conquorers desire power above all else. They wish to route out all competitors and destroy them, and to be the only sign of life in these lands.<br/>\u200b<br/>Research can increase production power, add buildings such as water towers, armouries and taverns, and even encourage cannibalism.<br/><br/><br/>Map editor:<br/><br/>The Map Editor is the first thing you see after entering your name and the name of your civilisation. On the screen are 3 different sized paintbrushes, as well as a tile selection panel so you can paint tiles. You can also adjust sliders to regenerate your land- as well as paste in seeds you might get from the forum for example.<br/>\u200b<br/>The Editor is really easy to use, allowing you to create beautiful hand-made landscapes. The default areas are perfectly usable and randomly generated, but you can create dead wastelands, vast deserts, biome based places or one single island to fight over- you can even recreate some of your favourite maps from other games!<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios (a work in progress!)<br/><br/>Scenarios add a new dimension to the game. They start you in developer hand made lands, with existing settlements and buildings, with challenges to overcome- similar to old Rollercoaster Tycoon games!<br/>\u200b<br/>Your goal is to stabilise all settlements and regain control. Whether you need to quickly forge an army to defeat enemy encampments- or save a settlement from extinction! You will wonder how the mess could have been created in the first place.<br/>\u200b<br/>Scenarios are fun additions for players who have became experienced in the main game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spiritlands is a fun game packed with content and lots to manage and grow. If you like incremental games, and games of this style you will enjoy this game! Brought to you by the creators of Project Abyss, we work with players to make any adjustments we agree are needed- and many tweaks and small features have been added this way!<br/><br/>Check out https://www.tallstorystudios.com/ forums for more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36ee5c6eeafb14e0c7a5a046c2233211.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/SpiritlandsGame/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 43, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tall Story Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tall Story Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
