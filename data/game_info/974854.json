It has been 40 years since the Technate has taken control of the world. In their arrogance and gluttony, they created a breed of intelligent pig. These pigs were trained from birth to self slaughter when they reach mature age. For a time, the Technocrats enjoyed their meat.<br/><br/>Then, a special boar was born -- one hellbent on destroying the Technate and putting the pigs at their rightful place atop the tower. His name was Rudy Hammon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rudy must destroy the Technocratic infrastructure in his mission to dethrone Klaus K\u00fcller, the highest of the Technocrats. Along the way, he will face mutants, giant robots, and pork-crazed scientists who can't stop eating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game plays like classics from the 80s and 90s such as Contra and Turrican. Find power-ups. Earn upgrades. Swim, shoot, and roll for pig freedom!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Music by Ghostfeeder", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T06:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/167127b8ca30fcd086b5e22465c7356a.jpg", "website": "https://www.cascadiagames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cascadia Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cascadia Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
