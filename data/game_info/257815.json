It is a hectic local multiplayer deathmatch with 18 playable disembodied heads, two maps, and two game modes.</p>\n<p>I originally made this after making Flapphogg for Flappy Jam and wondering if WizFight would still be fun if I mixed it with gameplay elements from Flappy Bird. It was never developed into anything more than a proof of concept, but, being little more than a WizFight mod, it is quite playable despite that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8ca66da796209fc25cb58199005b710d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Chelen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
