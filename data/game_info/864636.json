Private Investigator, a wild card whose life mission is to end the reign of terror led by\u00a0the crime lord who killed your entire family:\u00a0the Queenpin of the Red Hat gang. To do so, you must stealthily traverse the warehouse her gang calls their headquarters, collecting evidence in the hopes of finally putting her behind bars. The more clues you collect, the higher chance you have of achieving this. Be careful not to get shot on the way.<br/></p>\n<p>This project was created to be a point and click\u00a0top-down adventure game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first level has the player navigate an open level with only one roaming enemy that you need to take down in order to progress to the next level - a key for the warehouse. There is a hidden clue somewhere in the environment that can count towards your final score/sentence.</p>\n<p>The second level has you traverse the warehouse setting, finding more hidden clues (8 total in this stage), including a keycard you must acquire to get to the next level. The number of enemies is increased, and they roam a set path to make it harder to collect everything. The player must stealth around the enemies and avoid their lines of sight. If they are seen, they then must retreat before being killed and sent to the beginning of the level.</p>\n<p>The third level has the player enter the Boss' office, where they must retrieve a specific clue (the important files) as well as a hidden clue. Upon collecting the files, they will trigger the boss fight where they are caught red handed by the Queenpin and must face off in an epic battle that involves a lot of particle effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T10:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e790d1538ce088a90774201e35c8deb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ec3938", "Taneim", "spearmintorbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
