While you are in a dark environment or considered \"lost\" you play as a\u00a0 short wizard we have named Lost. While you are in a bright area or considered \"found\", you play as a lighthearted swordswoman named Found.\u00a0Lost jumps higher using magic and has a ranged attack that can hit through walls, but he's quite slow. Found however is incredibly acrobatic, has the ability to dash through the air, and attacks with a sword.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T13:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65df0c0714ecbf13dc0997991a7ba8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garrett Shipp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
