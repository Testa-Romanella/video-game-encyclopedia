This app will work it out and allow you to share the result on Facebook and Twitter!  <br/><br/>You can add up individual salaries and/or multiply a salary by the number of people in the room.  Salaries can be added in per-year or per-hour format.  <br/><br/>When you're ready, start the timer and watch the cost add up.  If you need to close the app so your boss doesn't notice - that's not a problem; open it later when it's safe to do so.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaa39647776bf9723ef24bc71e82a08f_zMmLvm3.jpg", "website": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaWQBM1OpeQ", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Edmund Thomas"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Edmund Thomas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
