{"id": 188989, "slug": "crawling-dungeon-alpha", "name": "Crawling Dungeon Alpha", "name_original": "Crawling Dungeon Alpha", "description": "<p>Crawling Dungeon is a top down 2d rpg with a twist. Their is no items! The only way to get stronger is to level up by killing mobs and bosses. All up their will be 25 campaign dungeons with extra ones for boss rushes and maybe raids. So far you can only access the first 5 campaign dungeons and nothing else. When you start walk up to the NPC who is your guide and press \"F\" and he will give you the basics. At first each dungeon is the same thing, kill enemies, fight giant virsion of them as a boss. But the last 2 are different. The 4th dungeon has a tactic for the boss, and the 5th boss has a tactic and instead of being just a giant virsion of what you versed in the dungeon its a new creature. You can find out the tactics in the trailer video. I'm trying to make the boss fights more unique as i go but it all comes down to my ability to code, if i cant figure it out myself and cant find the answer online i wont be able to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Pricing<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I have made the alpha free but if you wish you can donate to me. Any\u00a0 donations are highly appreciated. The beta will also be free so you can\u00a0 all play that when it releases. For the full game I havent decided if\u00a0 its going to cost, I'm leaning towards it costing, but it wont cost\u00a0 much.</p>\n<p>Please do give my game a try, should take under 25 minutes depending if you rush it or not and if you try all the classes. Please give me feedback so i know how I'm going, just dont be to harsh if you dont like it, this is only my first game.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATES:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>v0.0.2: <strong>CLASSES</strong> - I have now officially added classes to the game, after clicking Start Game you will be taken to a screen where you can select a class out of Warrior, Assassin and Mage. Each one has different stats for different play styles. Below are more details about each class.</p>\n<p><strong>Warrior - The Tank</strong> - this class is the tank class, he has high health but low damage, he only has medium defence or some enemies would deal 0 damage. He moves rather slow but with the amount of damage he can take its not a problem. When he attacks it takes half a second to finish the swing so he can move again, he also cant attack again for 0.3 seconds so players cant just spam the attack button. Use the Warriors massive health pool to your advantage<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assassin - Melee DPS </strong>- this class is a melee DPS class and is just what it sounds like and Assassin. He has low health but high damage insta killing most standared enemies. He moves very fast so can avoid taking damage which brings me to my next point, you really dont want to take many hits as the Assassin as he has such low health, you will die very quickly. When he attacks it take 0.25 seconds to finish the swing so he can move again, he also cannot attack again for 0.25 seconds meaning he can do massive damage output. However standing there pressing attack wont win you the game as you will die very quickly. Use the Assassin's speed and fast attacks along with his high damage output to your advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Mage - Ranged DPS</strong> - this class is a ranged DPS class, you can click on the screen and he will fire a magic ball at the mouse position that deals damage to any enemies in its path. If enemies get to close you can also attack with space like other classes dealing area damage. He has medium health, damage and speed. Now as he has 2 ways of attacking it takes him time before he can attack again, the projectile magic shot can only be fired once every second and his close range area damage attack makes him stand still while attacking (like other classes when they swing) for 0.35 seconds and he can only use this attack one every 0.9 seconds. The Mage is great for taking out multiple enemies as his magic shot goes through enemies dealing damage to the ones it hits and his close range area damage attack. Use the Mage's range and area damage to his advantage.<br/></p>\n<p><em>I do not have a Linux or Mac computer to test those builds so please let me know if they work.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/998a2f4a523518b67ca0c9c829e1f7ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AmazingCoreGaming"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
