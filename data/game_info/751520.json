Fly a wide array of historically authentic aircraft in missions that guide you through different scenarios of WWI.  Earn more advanced planes as you test your skills against unique challenges!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you take the controls, you become one of the great pilots that flew in the Great War.  You will be using your machine gun and bombs to destroy targets such as factories, command centres, pillboxes, vehicles, enemy aircraft and much more.  Each mission presents its own challenge.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWatch out!  There are ground defences that will shoot back at you! German aircraft and even the Red Baron himself, will hunt you down!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you succeed in completing sets of missions, you are given better airplanes to fly.  New planes are faster and more maneuverable.   Some have a better machine gun, some have more bombs, some can take much more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach airplane in Great Pilots was created to be an authentic image of the real WWI fighter airplane.  Missions have been created to mirror the progress of the war, such as the battle of Verdun<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake the controls and take your place among the Great Pilots!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T03:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/9324f1d2d8965b817ab804b735c0d5db.jpg", "website": "https://keepplaying.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keep Playing Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Keep Playing Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
