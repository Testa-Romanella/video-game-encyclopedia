It seems peace doesn\u2019t last forever.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA horrible curse was laid upon the land and Eventide Hollow fell into despair. The source of the curse was also its only protection from it\u2026 the Holomento.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Holomento traps the souls of all who possess it, the mysterious book affixes itself to those who seek passage through the Hollow. If the Traveler dies, their soul is also added to the Holomento before it returns to its resting place awaiting the next traveler.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce acquired, the book is tied to the soul of the traveler holding it. The Holomento cannot leave the Eventide Hollow and therefore any Traveler who possesses it cannot leave the land.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T19:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/510ac159088683b72c544e4f8c294db0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Weech"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Deck13"], "esrb_rating": null}
