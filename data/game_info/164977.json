It was inspired by an 80s movie about a boy who gave secret services during pizza deliveries to beautiful female clients who were bored with their lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Pizzaboy Ultimate is the sequel to a 2015 Flash Game Pizzaboy: Secret Service. PBU is a cross platform game and attempts to be more expansive as it will contain more features and locations in the future. The core game that is linked here contains 9 levels. Another difference is, PBU uses pre-rendered 3d graphics for the sex scenes unlike the simplistic animations that were seen in Pizzaboy: Secret Service. It also adds a new mechanic which is called\u00a0 the companion system and this enables the player to enlist other skycycles to aid them in battle.</p>\n<p>Core Game Features:</p>\n<p>- 9 colorful levels<br/>- More than 10 enemy types including bosses<br/>- 9 female characters including sexy scenes, dialogue and unique sprites<br/>- Fully animated sex scenes<br/>- 3 unlockable companion characters<br/>- Upgradable weapons and other equipment<br/>- Crossplatform: PC, Linux, Mac, Browser, Android<br/>- High replayability<br/>- Connects to the original PT universe story arc</p>\n<p>For comments, suggestions or requests, please send us a message anytime! :-)</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>4/23/2018</p>\n<p>Updated</p>\n<p>2.04<br/>- Added classic controls as an alternate control scheme<br/>- Increased the initial movement speed by 50%\u00a0<br/>- Updated the 'controls' screen<br/>- Fixed the pizza pointer hotzone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942a2fbe570dcffa1f84c0814ef633d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hornblase"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
