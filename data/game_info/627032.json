Equipped with powerful blasters wich draw energy from the liquid neon in your blood you're on a hunt for loot and explore the lucent depths beneath.</p>\n<p>How far can you venture into the deep in this fast paced action platformer?</p>\n\n<p>When you die you loose all the loot you've collected in the current run. Every 3 dungeon layers there is a save area where you have the option to extract back to base and save your loot. The deeper you go the harder it gets but the more loot awaits you.<br/></p>\n<p>Beware of firing to much as your ammo is also your hp!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>---------- Controls </strong><strong>----------</strong><br/></p>\r\nMoveA / DJumpSpaceSwitch weaponQ / EShoot / InteractLeft mouse buttonShift cameraShift\r\n\n\n<p><strong>---------- Credits ----------</strong></p>\n<p>A game by Sarek Lambert</p>\n<p>Made with Lizbox\r\n</p>\n<p>https://jamjamteam.itch.io/lizbox</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0 \"cc.yal.6w3\" by Yellowafterlife</p>\n<p>https://yal.cc/r/19/fonts/license/non-profit/</p>\n<p>Music: Cyberpunk Synthwave MIX - Discovery by Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:51:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d21549fd27a78c3818e5cc71827e896c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamJamTeam"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
