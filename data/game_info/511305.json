Sadly, we did not make it. A lot of artwork and sounds are missing, a lot of concepts are not \u00a0developed to their full extent, and bugs are very probable. With this said, we still believe the core gameplay and the ideas implemented are fun, so give it a try.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Hey, we are the ones that developed this game. We are two students who just learned C# and Unity a few weeks ago, we will be happy to hear your thoughts!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/2964d74d14e1c1ac2b450e1bad89afbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potat0Ninja"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
