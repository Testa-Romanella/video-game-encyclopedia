His Dogo gets lost in the forest, where anything bad can happen... The woods are a dark place, where you can meet horrible spirits or hear scary sounds. Just imagine it. Heartbroken and alone in a dark place. You will do anything to find your loved one... but be careful - you also have a limit. Try to stay sane, or you will never see him again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T04:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc8e8d19633af4b975e2d94a4f418e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
