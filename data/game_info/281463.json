Once you\u2019ve experienced a car that drives itself, you will feel like you have stepped into the future. You will quickly get comfortable as the car smoothly and safely negotiated the suburban streets, including intersections and dense traffic. You just need to set the destination, put the car in autonomous drive mode and go off without a hitch. You can go on both the freeway and city streets; there will be time when other drivers cut in on you, but you will never feel threatened. Each time the car anticipated the other car\u2019s move and reacted appropriately.<br/><br/>Cars that can change lanes on their own, negotiate city streets and handle the drudgery of stop-and-go traffic are now reality and you can take a ride without pedal the metal and just sit behind the wheels.
