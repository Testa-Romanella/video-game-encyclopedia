Line your cards up carefully to exploit your enemy's weakness to control the battlefield, and turn the tides with special card abilities to shake up the game!</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0The game is free to play in your browser. If you'd like to help us fund development of our next game, we are also offering\u00a0a standalone version of the game for $2.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>These versions of the game are exactly the same.</strong></p>\n<p>The $2 donation for the standalone version is simply your way of supporting us in our next endeavor.</p>\r\nGlass Lion Games\r\n<p>Project Tetra was originally intended to be a personal project to build up my portfolio and get a job at some game dev studio. While I was working on it, a very good friend of mine insisted I let her replace all of the weird placeholder art with her art.</p>\n<p>Thus began the incredible journey of Glass Lion Games.</p>\n<p>Janie and I (I'm Charlie - Hello) started Glass Lion Games while we worked together on Project Tetra, which was a wonderful labor of love. It's been an incredible ride for the both of us, and we've both learned an insane amount from this endeavor.</p>\n<p>Project Tetra was always intended to be a portfolio piece, a learning piece, a small project, and when we started to wrap up the first level, we decided we had outgrown the idea, and set our sights on something bigger, and better.</p>\n<p>Project Tetra is officially listed as released because though it isn't a full game, it is what we intended for it to be. Of course, I\u00a0will continue to fix bugs as necessary, but...\u00a0Now we move on to our next game, tentatively titled Shrine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T04:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/8285dad840b996984df4161c3406d67f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Glass Lion Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
