It\u2019s no wonder you are still stuck in your artist block. Luckily enough, you\u2019ve got your trusty artist mannequin to help you think of some new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Artist Block is a game about <strong>striking poses with challenging and wacky controls.</strong> Swing the mannequin around with the mouse and freeze them in place with keys on the keyboard in order to get through progressively more difficult obstacles. Start by learning the basic shapes, and you will soon start overcoming recognizable patterns. Maybe you will even hit the perfect pose and overcome your Artist Block!</p>\n\n<p><em>Artist Block is a student project developed with Unity\u00a0at USC Games in collaboration with Berklee College of Music.</em></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT FOR MAC USERS!</strong></p>\n<p>You might have issues with your download... but that's okay!
