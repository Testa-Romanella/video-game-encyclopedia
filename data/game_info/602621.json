{"id": 602621, "slug": "ship-vs-sub", "name": "Ship VS Sub", "name_original": "Ship VS Sub", "description": "<p>Ship VS Sub is an asymmetrical, competitive, two player game, where two players use different tactics to destroy each other. Player 1 controls the battleship\u00a0with remote control depth charges while player 2 controls the submarine with naval mines. Both vehicles have different strengths and weaknesses. The battleship can take more hits than the sub and can aim their depth charges, but is slow, stuck on the top of the water and cannot move while piloting their attacks. On the other hand, the submarine is fast and can blend in with the darkness of the sea floor, but is more fragile and their mines are predictable. Both player's need to strategize and keep to their strengths in order to destroy their opponent and win!</p>\n<p>The game was made by me,\u00a0AVaucrosson on itch and two others for our 3rd year design challenge!</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 or 2 key to press start. Press for each player at start screen.</p>\n<p>Player 1/Ship: Arrow keys to move the ship and control the depth charge. Left click or left control to launch depth charge.</p>\n<p>Player 2/Sub: DRFG keys to move the sub.
