{"id": 860178, "slug": "neon-foosball", "name": "Neon Foosball", "name_original": "Neon Foosball", "description": "<p>HOW TO PLAY: (in-game too) - 1 Player mode (mobile friendly): - Use [W S] keys or joystick to move your players - (all ur players move at the same time) - (joystick is preferred for better control) - 2 Player mode (not cloud multiplayer): - Blue team: [W S] keys - Red team: [Up Down] keys - Objective: - Shoot on the opponent's net to gain 1 point - First to 5 points wins! Additional Instructions: - Players auto-kick ball towards opponent net when near it (but the computer's team sometimes doesn't auto-kick, to make the game less hectic) - Slide ur players up as you contact the ball to kick it upwards, or slide down to kick them downwards, or don't slide to bounce the ball - Want an extra-challenge mode? Turn turbo mode on in easy mode ;) ================================= Story: You like playing soccer and with neon-coloured toys in your free time. One day you were forced to move from Earth to another planet, where the ground is too wet to play soccer, and the days are far too bright to see your neon toys glow. Despite this, there's still wifi, so you logged onto Scratch as usual, hoping to relive your memories from Earth. Suddenly, you come across Neon Foosball by kevin_eleven_1234 which perfectly combines your memories of soccer and neon toys. \"With this game to bring back my memories, maybe this planet isn't so bad after all,\" you gigglingly say to yourself. ================================= Notes: - Feedback is appreciated! Smash a \u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f if you enjoyed or want more people to play. Huge thanks for the support everyone. More updates should come soon, and comment/remix if you got ideas! - Decided to make this since I was surprised to not see many foosball games on scratch, even though there's quite a lot for similar games like 8-ball pool or air hockey. I used to play foosball at lunch in highschool almost everyday, and plus I also wanted to make a foosball game since 2017, so here it is! - Tried the neat little \"pan left right\" block so the ball sound effects sound more 3D, but I don't think it's obvious to notice without pointing it out... - Feel free to remix with new ball designs and tag it below and I'll most likely check it out! #art #games #all #music #story #epicbackstory ================================= Updates (dd/mm/yy): - 16/02/21 (v1.1): - increased difficulty of hard mode - tweaked thumbnail and table graphics - added more sound effects in-game - added share results option - 20/02/2 1(v1.2): - edited some graphics like table texture - added customize shop - added handsome squid ward as a ball lol - added insane mode! - added floor texture ================================= Credits: - Graphics: - Got inspired by this image to make neon-style graphics: https://www.arcadepartyrental.com/led-games-rental/led-tornado-foosball/ - All graphics designed by K11 in Scratch/LunaPic/Google Drawings - thumbnail shine steaks inspired by @theChAOTiC - Handsome squidward ball from Spongebob - Font: Comfortaa, Alfa Slab One in Google Drawings Game concept: - Credits to the real foosball game for gameplay - And also got inspired by Foosball on Poki.com so check that game out it's even better!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T12:44:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab0140d459dfc3423a6049870119dd39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bunjeejumper2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
