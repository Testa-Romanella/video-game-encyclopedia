Now I did a remake \"Jerry's endless travels:Save Erick\" for dragon computers. Currently only .sna format. In this game you must save Jerry from kage.Text in this game explains the storyline.\u00a0Also I used empty fields in text in order to display text correctly for dragon computer. Probably I will made more stuff about this saga (commercial ones too).
