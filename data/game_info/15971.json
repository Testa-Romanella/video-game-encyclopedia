Strike a balance between attacking, defending, and building your economy to control the board. Blast your opponent with shockwave towers or strike them from afar with the lightning cannon. Construct additional power plants to boost your power economy and extend your reach with substations. Is the situation looking exceedingly grim? Overcharge your power plants for a last ditch defense or a surprise attack!<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Serious strategy in a light-hearted setting<br/></strong></li><li> <strong>Plan your moves carefully:</strong> as with any turn-based strategy game, make tactical decisions and work with the outcome<br/></li><li> <strong>Your leader knows best:</strong> Commander Grak knows it all and is not shy to share his thoughts.
