Mindustry <strong>really</strong>\u00a0hit home though, as it added that Herzog Zwei / Dune 2 kick that bodies crave. This game is an homage to all that.</p>\n<p>It was hella ambitious in terms of features, even for a 72 hour project, and that shows mostly in the relatively thin amount of content. Note all the empty spaces in the builder grid. I took pains to add extra instructions to the main screen, as well as clear error messages when making incorrect build connections, but that was done at the cost of some bug proofing. Most critically:\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's easy to place buildings too close to each other, or even overlapping. For maximum game enjoyment, <em>don't do that</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.0a bugfix</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Two showstopper bugs fixed, involving resource spawning breaking and the shrine no longer accepting Weapons after level 3.</li><li>World mesh stretching/tearing bug fixed.</li><li>End of Wave menu responds to joystick input.\u00a0</li><li>Credits added.</li><li>Leaderboards \"work\", but deeper fixes felt outside the scope of what's fair to allow after submission.</li></ul>\n<p>No gameplay changes were made.
