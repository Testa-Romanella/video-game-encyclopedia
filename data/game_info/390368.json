Move it on the table by pressing \"WASD\" keys.</p><p><strong>JAM:</strong> They are your enemies, you must avoid them!</p><p><strong>BUTTER:</strong> Grab it and use it to shoot \u00a0jams with directional arrows (\u2191 \u2193 \u2192 \u2190). On screen top-right you can see how many butters you have . No more then 1 butter at a time is on the table and the next appears only after you have grabbed it.</p>\n<p><strong>TOASTER:</strong> Consider it as the only friend you have in this game. It spawns every 30 seconds. When colliding it, the toast flies for a couple of seconds and if lots of jam jars are on the table, the toaster will remove a few.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:14:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b00ec718b59ca1c9bb05fb33ef94462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Berix"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
