This game's development was started with a huge dream of making a survival endless\u00a0\u00a0runner, But it ended up with some random weird endless runner game...\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>It was my first game and also very first experience with Unity Game engine and C#. As they always say First game is your worst game but not always the last game you will ever make. I learned a lot during It's designing and Development process.
