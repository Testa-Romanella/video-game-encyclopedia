With its <strong>real-world battlefields</strong> and painstakingly recreated weapons, equipment and uniforms all rendered in the stunning CRYENGINE, Vanguard: Normandy 1944 challenges players to <strong>fight and secure historic WWII objectives</strong> during the most ferocious and intense battle of modern history: D-Day.<br/><br/>It\u2019s June 6th 1944 and the Allied Invasion of Europe has begun. Take and hold crucial objectives as members of the elite Airborne Division, or hold the line as the fierce German Wehrmacht in this tactical <strong>multiplayer squad-based shooter</strong>.<br/><br/>GameplayVanguard: Normandy 1944 immerses players into the intensity of online close-quarters infantry combat. In our <strong>Raid</strong> gamemode, <strong>every life matters</strong>; hold the line as the defenders, take up ambush positions with your squad, and critically stay alive to hold the objective. Alternatively, assault the objective as the attacking team by advancing with your squad, suppressing the enemy, and wiping out the defenders to capture the objective.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We designed Raid as our principle gamemode because we want to put the player in the <strong>boots of an infantry soldier</strong> and instantly experience a slice of <strong>hectic, hardcore combat</strong> on real-life battlefields without having to run around a large map trying to find the action.Key Features<ul><li>Hardcore squad vs squad objective-based Raid gamemode to experience the intensity of battle where <strong>every single life matters</strong> in short intense rounds.<br/></li><li>Focused infantry combat in real-world historic locations, rendered in the stunning CRYENGINE.<br/></li><li>Lead the way by suppressing the enemy and use squad-based tactics to capture or defend the objectives and wipe out the enemy.<br/></li><li>Fight with authentic weaponry and equipment as part of the British or German forces.<br/></li><li>Immersive 3D audio that puts you into the intense firefights and helps you to pinpoint the enemy gunfire (headphones required).</li></ul><br/>Inspiration for the GameThe team developing Vanguard: Normandy 1944 came together because of the desire to play a <strong>historically accurate, tactical, team-based</strong> multiplayer game that is still accessible and fun to play (yes, we do believe those features can co-exist!). We don\u2019t want to spend 20 minutes walking to an objective, or game rounds lasting over an hour. We want to create an intense and tactical objective-based shooter in a modern engine that is fun to play, yet players still face the threat that a single bullet can end their life. You will find that a well organised squad utilising suppression and manoeuvring as a single fighting unit is the most effective road to success.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fab050518378b19f141209694be5dec4.jpg", "website": "https://www.vanguardww2.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pathfinder Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Pathfinder Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
