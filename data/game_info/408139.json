It is a platform where user can experience, analyse and learn from various real life zoonosis outbreak simulations.\u00a0\u00a0On this project I have been working on programming early prototypes\u00a0and UX-UI design. <br/><br/>Sadly our main programmer, who was responsible for implementing UI design worked last minute and did not manage to implement all of the features. Perhaps one day I will reprogram everything and implement what was lost.</p>\n<p>My approach to UX design was systematizing and reducing information by implementing interaction \u2014 choice to access as much information as one need in order to solve the outbreak. In some cases like dialogue choices instead of displaying full sentences I narrowed information to one word which makes experience more intuitive. There are several ways player can gather information: by interacting with environment, having conversations, conducting research (computer, microscope).To store, display and revise all the data I have designed a logbook system, a mechanic that stores and categorizes information in clues and sub-clues: #2clue Blood on the ground \u2022 the goat Betsy gave birth \u2022 blood contains Coxielia Buretti. Additionally once pressed the logbook is used to reveal more in debt clue explanation, read more about characters or locations, travel and configure settings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe550b3b0942b781e2e575f7775339a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roocktopus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
