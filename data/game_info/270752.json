As a round progresses, the balls get closer. If they get too close, you lose the round. Combos can knock the balls backwards to give you more time to finish the round.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSometimes, powerups will pop up that add custom abilities to your bubble blasters, such as the rapid fire ability if you pick up a machine gun powerup.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSee how far you can get and compete on the global steam leaderboards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you like fast paced puzzle arcade games that progressively get harder as you play, this might be the game for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae1ae5de9204d719ffbf0309b41c47c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Disco"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["David Disco"], "esrb_rating": null}
