It incorporates a complete sound system, realistic physics system, narrow-phase collision detection and resolution, along with a complete UI system.</p>\n<p>The project utilises an event system that keeps the codebase decoupled. This enables the graphics system, for example, to communicate with the physics system without ever needing to know of its existence. This ensures the code is easier to understand and maintain.</p>\n<p>This is all driven by a level state machine that manages each level, adding and removing objects when changing to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c88e227489447a658d3f71989c56ea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kyle Robinson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
