It was a very enlightening experience, working to deadlines and having curve balls thrown at us.</p>\n<p>This project was done by me, Alex De'Oliveira and James Porley. I'm very impressed with what we were able to pull off in only a 5 week period.</p>\n<p>My contributions to this project were, programming everything, this included learning xml file reading, having input on dialogue and narrative, system design and game feel and ui design.</p>\n<p>C&amp;C is more then welcome, it is unlikely that we'll ever go back to this project, but I'm always wanting to improve!</p>\n<p>Cheers Mates!</p>\n<p>Andrew.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T09:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b46ff948340c607047b4fb7fb324e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Spinks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
