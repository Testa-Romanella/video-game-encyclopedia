You are a miner in the Klondike gold rush with a map and 100 mines to explore. Select a mine and try to uncover its gold by playing a game of solitaire.<br/>Each mine contains a unique specific solitaire deal with the cards in the same locations each time you try that mine. Each deal is designed to be winnable, unlike a random deal of solitaire where most games cannot be won. You've just got to figure out the right sequence of moves to clear all of the cards.<br/>You start with 1,000g (gold) and it costs 50g to explore a mine or restart the solitaire game in the mine. You can also spend 1g by using the Undo button while playing. When you win a game you will be awarded 1,000g.<br/>Try to explore all of the mines and claim all of the gold! Compare your scores with your friends on Game Center. Try to gain achievements as you work your way toward clearing all of the mines.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/4039aa670d68b2754da010bca78695ca.jpg", "website": "http://clevermedia.com/iphonegames/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CleverMedia"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["CleverMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
