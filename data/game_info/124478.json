It's a good example of what can be achieved in such a small space with this old language, We rescued this game now, after 10 years!! and We wanted to share it with all of you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou'll need a real Msx computer or a Msx emulator in order to play the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nNo compiler, or assembler routine has been used, it is pure Msx1 basic, so prepare yourself for a bit slow experience during level loading ;P Enjoy!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThis was my first \"real\" game for a retro computer, I'm sharing the game and the code too for learning purposes. If you like this, you can follow me on Twitter \r\n\t@VolcanoBytes  and take a look at my other projects.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d6/6d6c084060dab1c0dddb1c3606069d36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VolcanoBytes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
