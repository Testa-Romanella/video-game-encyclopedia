I believe all assets not made by myself are CC0 / public domain / otherwise freely distributable. Please let me know if that's not the case.</p><p>Have fun, punks!</p><p>http://itch.io/jam/wizard-jam<br/>http://soupermatty.itch.io/cyberpunk-carp-killer<br/>smith.matty@gmail.com</p><p><strong>QUICK REFERENCE:</strong><br/>Arrow keys to move.<br/>Move towards object to attack it.<br/>You cannot attack the zombies, you must avoid those!<br/>M - map overlay<br/>T - play/pause tunes<br/>ESC - quit<br/>Enter/Space - confirm</p><p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>Main project including base sprites tweaked and extended from the Unity 2D Roguelike tutorial here http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-rog...<br/>Music - \"Dubna 48K\" from Patrick R on the idle forums, https://soundcloud.com/wizard-jam-sound-bank/dubna... <br/>Additional audio - various clips from Idle Thumbs podcast content https://www.idlethumbs.net/<br/>Wall brick textures - SpiderDave http://opengameart.org/content/27-bricks<br/>Interior tiles - most by Buch http://opengameart.org/users/buch http://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-interior-til...<br/>Carp title screen, logo and tiles - Me!
