{"id": 54663, "slug": "illbleed", "name": "Illbleed", "name_original": "Illbleed", "description": "<p>Illbleed is a survival horror video game developed by Crazy Games (formerly known as &quot;Climax Graphics&quot;) and published by Crazy Games in Japan and AIA in the US for the Sega Dreamcast. It was released in Japan on March 29, 2001, and later in North America on April 16, 2001.<br />\nIllbleed is also the only Dreamcast game which had an official Chinese version, released on January 15, 2002 by publisher Mr.Game. A Hong Kong game magazine at the time was responsible for the translation work. After numerous delays and rumours of cancellation, the Traditional Chinese version was finally released 10 months after the original Japanese release. Only 300 copies were released in Taiwan and it only came in a boxset, which included the outer box, the game itself and a 2002 calendar in a CD jewel case. The official Chinese name of Illbleed roughly translates to &quot;Entering the haunted realm&quot;.<br />\nDespite being financially unsuccessful, this game received a worldwide cult following for its notable combination of nonlinear gameplay elements (e.g. trap detection) and bizarre B-movie style comedy horror theme, dialogue and voice acting.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2001-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-13T02:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9a7/9a7288d0a117aae70389b65df77751d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 398, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Crazy Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["AIA", "Crazy Games", "Mr.Game"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
