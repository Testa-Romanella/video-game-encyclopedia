Some of these robots hid as best they could and formed their own gangs to \u201csurvive\u201d.</p>\n<p>This is where our main character and his story comes in.</p>\n<p>Bob is one of the first models that came out to replace the workers on the construction sites, unfortunately he lost an arm trying to flee from the human revolts against the robots.</p>\n<p>He is looking for a way to restart a robot to make him \"company\". Until he arrives at an abandoned house that allows him to prepare it for a restart but just when he was going to connect it to the electricity, the current that came from the electric poles goes out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afeba41e6998159857b2f9d53522e95e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lozur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
