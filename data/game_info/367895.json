Looong jump by holding the key.</p>\n<p>Bounce on the souls' head to gather the Karma.<br/>Held Karma is indicated in colored counter in the screen's corners.</p>\n<p>While jumping, don't miss the souls or you may fall to a certain doom. You'll also need to bounce on one if you want to reach the other side.</p>\n<p>Touch a fountain to depose the corresponding type of Karma and score a equivalent amount of points.</p>\n<p>Harvested good Karma will deplete the same amount of any bad karma you might hold, and vice versa. Try to collect only one Karma type at the same time!</p>\n<p>You'll score a little bonus if you combo-jump more than 3 souls without your feet touching the ground.</p>\n<p>As your score goes up, the game will become harder and harder.<br/>Good luck!
