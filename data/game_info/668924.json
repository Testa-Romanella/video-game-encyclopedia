So what you do? Ask for it, but it won't be easy...Because you have to ask it to your BOSS!<br/>The game consists on talking with your boss to increase the likelihood of being promoted, but be careful! Because if you say something that he don't like, his patience-meter will increase, and the more higher is the red line, the more angry will be your boss! You have only 7 attemps to convince your boss, and when the counter reaches 0, you will see the final result! Say things that he likes and convince your boss that you deserve that promotion and obviously, don't get fired, and don't leave your boss at the edge of colapse!<br/><br/><strong>ATTENTION:</strong>\u00a0<strong>The \"How to play\" button is bugged and when you click on it the play button will not work. If you clicked on it, restart the game with alt + f4 and press the Play button without pressing the \"How to play\" button and the game will start. Sorry about that. (Also, heres what it says, so you can see it without getting buged lol)</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:34:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34c/34c8ec423f71aaac1094b04023523607.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngelHYYPE"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
