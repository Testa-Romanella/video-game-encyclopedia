After some classmates and friends said they enjoyed playing the game (despite it being incredibly barebones), I decided I'd make a desktop version to help me learn Godot.</p>\n<p>The game has a basic loop: click to look for berries or sticks, and eat berries so that you don't starve, while using the sticks to craft baskets to hold more berries.</p>\n<p>The game will also save your progress, allowing you to close the game and return to it later.</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on a full release of the game, one that'll actually have\u00a0<em>real gameplay</em> and\u00a0<em>graphics</em> and whatnot. Until then, here's the Lite version. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63f/63f4038344d13db78843d80d9636f472.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calquelator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
