The world generates new planets, and your goal is to populate as many of them. You collect space rocks using a vacuum, then craft buildings which you can plop down on the planets. You can also craft a mine which will generate you rocks until the planet has ran out. If a planet is populated enough, the\u00a0inhabitants will start to seek out to other planets by flying with mini spaceships.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a31bddfc2de6fa8b70a89ac178f87422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jogrophy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
