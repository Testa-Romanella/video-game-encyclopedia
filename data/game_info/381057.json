What can you do? <br/></p>\r\nControl\r\n<p>- Movement from one corner to another (RMB)<br/>- Attack around you (LMB)<br/>- Attack breaks your movement<br/>- Attack richoshet projectiles of red bots.<br/></p>\r\nAfterwords\r\n<p>- Game have 10 different levels, but after 10 level you begin from 0 again.</p>\n<p>- Alright, i created what i created in this period. Just good luck!<br/>On start, I planned other gameplay more in mix of Tomb of the mask + Katana zero(with rooms, doors and etc.), but simplify this for time)<br/>But, enjoy it, if you can :)</p>\n<p>- Now blue bots have more chances for missing, so i think you can stop spam LMB :) Basically, i want for counter attack when you and bot simultaneously attack, but in jam period time is not my friend and now it will be a new feature, i think :(<br/><br/>- I try\u00a0 to create a fast action game. After Katana Zero speedruns all becoming very sloooow for me :)<br/><br/>-\u00a0 Appreciate feedback and any ideas. For example, i think very good idea with attack in movement in this conceptions, without stop. But what do you think about it?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Ludum Dare Page for your ratings:<br/>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/ld45-cyber-tentacles<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:34:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1428d7c9de67edf5b58b9d8a22f23c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chiva"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
