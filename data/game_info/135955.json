Try it out, it's one of my funner ones.</p>\n<p>From the original release:</p>\n<p><strong>DON'T STOP MOVING</strong>. Fly through an interstellar grand canyon as the walls slowly\u00a0close in on you. Destroy wave after wave of enemies trying to get you. Dual\u00a0<br/>weapon gameplay, one for killing and another for pushing the walls back.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>From the title screen press <strong>ENTER</strong> to begin the game.\u00a0<br/><br/>During the game you control your ship with the arrow keys.\u00a0<br/><br/>As time goes on, enemies will fly at you and the walls will slowly close in.\u00a0<br/>You have two guns to deal with both of these problems:\u00a0<br/><br/>Pressing (or holding) X will shoot the Alpha gun, a blue bolt that will kill\u00a0<br/>enemies. Kill enemies to earn points.\u00a0<br/><br/>Holding C will charge and shoot your Beta gun. A pink bolt that pushes the\u00a0<br/>walls back when it hits an enemy.\u00a0<br/><br/>The bar at the top is your health. It goes down when you take damage. The game\u00a0<br/>is over when your health goes to 0 or the walls crush you\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>Some enemies have a chance to drop powerups. The red powerup will restore some\u00a0<br/>of your health. The blue powerup will improve both of your guns.\u00a0<br/><br/>Try to get the blue powerups whenever possible, this will improve your Beta gun\u00a0<br/>so you can push the walls back when they start to close in really fast.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70d56ba95f6b3b07a29d9163987092bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["leafo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
