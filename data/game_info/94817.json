But, unlike most games this isn't as simple as just pressing a button. The larger a cluster of beets you tap the more points you get, but beets are always moving and clearing out as you tap them. The goal is to keep your streak bonus multiplier up while getting the largest combos you can to get the highest score.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere are also a few special beets like the titular Fat Beets that explodes and will chain into other colors, the Dope Beet that doubles the points of the combo, and the Rainbow Beet that will behave differently depending on what color note is up. As well as power-ups selected before a song that can either make the game more forgiving for new players or help get more points for more experienced players.\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e3f2ef7546892f0018769abcf1c4e91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Giant Evil Robot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
