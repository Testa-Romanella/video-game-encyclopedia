As a kid, you inexplicably gained the ability to talk to common grocery items. Now you use that power to solve crimes nobody else is equipped for.</p>\n\n<p>It was a day like any other, until you were called up. Someone had stolen a Sandwich just before lunch - only you can solve the case. Interrogate the leftovers, and if they don't cooperate make them talk. Food does not have rights.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Alex Williams (https://byrabbit.itch.io/) and Dennis Lorenz (@d3nni5lor3nz) for the Shenanijam 2018 (https://itch.io/jam/bscotch2018).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>After long debates over suitable game concepts, we got inspired by both the Void Sandwich and the Sticky Justice theme, and ended up with a Cop interrogating an Office Fridge. Made by 2 people,\u00a0so we also got the Tango Achievement!</p>\n\n<p>Now with a Web Build :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/03211b455866883382423fb112c26687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["d-lo", "ByRabbit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
