Not even the mightiest of mountains!<br/>One mega jump at a time, he will reach platforms and defeat the polar environment.<br/><br/>Penguinette was searching for food and for a bit of me time to reflect about their lives in the arctic.

In truth, she was getting tired of this polar setting.<br/><br/>Penguin is lovable, but not the brightest of the pack. It took him a while to realize that she had gone for more than a day. He began to panic and called her name throughout the ice floe. He braved white bears, angry sharks and imaginary penguins sliding through the aurora borealis. Finally, he arrived at the foot of the great mountain.<br/><br/>And here kids, things got serious.<br/><br/>As a response to his calls, he heard her muffled voice coming from great heights. She called out to him, too scared to come down, afraid of sliding to oblivion.<br/><br/>Bravely, Penguin began to jump from ice platform to ice platform, fighting the winds, the falling snow and his own fear. For nothing would stop him from reaching his beloved. Happy thoughts, happy feet, our little hero did as his idol, pengu, had done many times. He rose to the occasion!<br/><br/>HELP PENGUIN REACH THE TOP, FIND HIS ONE TRUE LOVE, AND REMIND HER WHY SHE MARRIED SUCH A DOPE :)<br/><br/>Penguin Drama is a game for kids and adults alike !
