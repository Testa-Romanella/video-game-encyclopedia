Get to know one of your fellow monks, give them gifts, and try to convince them to break their sacred vows in pursuit of a worldly relationship.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tManual\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Movement</p>\n<p>X - Interact/Select</p>\n<p>\r\n\tZ - Open/Close Inventory\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Getting Started:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe NPCs with hearts next to their portraits are possible suitors. You can attempt to garner their affections by talking to them daily and giving them gifts. Be sure to talk to other NPCs though too, as they might have a task for you to do to earn something lovely to give to your chosen suitor. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>There are some problems with the game as it was created for a jam and we didn't have enough time to iron out all the bugs. After the third day, the dateable NPCs will not advance in the dialogue schedule. You can still increase their affections for you by giving them gifts and talking to them, but they won't be saying anything new. Also the nomads (who arrive on the fourth day) say their Day 7 dialogue first. Just ignore their goodbyes; they're not leaving quite yet.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCreated for the LOWREZJAM 2016\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t~by~\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Kyle Reisner </strong>- <em>Direction, Art</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Hugo Delahousse</strong> - <em>Programming</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sam Regas</strong> - <em>Writing</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Andrew Garcia</strong> - <em>Music</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><br/>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecdce945c047885d07f94af255d4a70f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["\u2606goldstarstickrs\u2606"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
