Heavily inspired by the \"Zero Escape\" series.<br/>The prototype features one <em>Escape The Room</em> sequence - Roughly 20-30 min play time.</p>\n<p>First thing I've made using the Unity Engine; being a fan of the this type of genre of games I created this game to learn how to use the game engine itself, therefore the quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired.<br/>Nonetheless if you do choose to take a gander at this game, I hope you find something you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>Music gathered from \"TeknoAXE Royalty Free Music\"<br/>TeknoAXE.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/6846ab6436d8393cd6ab1d3ddd8b9656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CrystalEllipsis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
