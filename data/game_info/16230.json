The birds fly and bounce around like tiny dog-fighting planes. <br/>Features<ul><li>2 - 4 player VS mode<br/></li><li>Single or 2 player coop campaign<br/></li><li>Collaborative level editor. Play while you edit.<br/></li></ul>First time flyersThe controls are simple. But to fly around effectively takes skill and practice to master. Here are some tips for improving your game:<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Take your finger off the flap button sometimes: You rotate faster if you aren't flapping.<br/></li><li>Boost into a wall and you will rebound in the opposite direction.<br/></li><li>Tackle your opponents by boosting into them.<br/></li><li>Shooting is important, you fly slower when holding the ball. With practice you can perform lob shots, rebounds and passes.<br/></li><li>Some players prefer to use the right trigger for flapping (not me!). If you hold it just right, you can almost hover on the spot.<br/></li></ul>Make your own levels together:<br/>Build a level with your friends using the collaborative level editor. <br/>Quickly switch between flying and drawing to test the level as you make it.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/0488a78a986a46e7c2531093fcc394d2.jpg", "website": "http://www.waynetron.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Waynetron"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Waynetron"], "esrb_rating": null}
