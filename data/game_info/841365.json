Solve 25+ puzzles by discovering the most efficient way to connect cities using your available pieces.<h3>25+ maps from across the world</h3>Journey across the world with 25+ levels each set on a map from a different country. As you tune your logic across early maps like New Zealand and Turkey, you'll face increasingly challenging puzzles, culminating in the World map, which only top players have been able to solve.<br/><br/><h3>Connect all the cities to win</h3>Just tap on routes to build them if you have the available colors. Beat a level by connecting all of the cities on the map and turning your red city nodes to green.<br/><br/><h3>Find the secret path on every level</h3>Each level is designed to push you to uniquely think of tradeoffs, combinations, and patterns to find the path that connects all the cities.<br/><br/><h3>Simple to learn, challenging to master</h3>You'll learn the core mechanics quickly, but then will face increasing route possibilities and larger maps as you progress through the campaign.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T04:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7dde2fb207f2564bd68c61edaac2e4a.jpg", "website": "https://routemania.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["Roadtrip Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Roadtrip Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
