This means with consecutive levels you can\u00a0 create a ridiculous, high damage, bullet hose to fire at your enemies. However, the damage of the turrets increases slightly every level as well. So as you become more powerful, you also become more fragile.</p><p>This game makes procedurally generated levels of custom-made level pieces.\u00a0 I designed the rooms, hallways, and turret placement for each room. The game decides what rooms and corridors make up a level as well as which turret goes in what spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move and Left Click to shoot. You can also sprint with Shift and wallrun for some added dodging mobility.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b67/b67012231af28632546bce4a71791787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WillReardon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
