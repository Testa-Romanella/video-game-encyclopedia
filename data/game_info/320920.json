I wasn't able to implement everything I had in mind, but it is playable and as polished as I could to in that time.</p>\n<p>I used a custom build and export templates for Linux and Windows, so there might me engine related bugs. The Windows version is only tested via wine, there were some audio issues on my side.\u00a0For the MacOS-Build I used an export template kindly provided by\u00a0Hugo Locurcio at\u00a0https://hugo.pro/projects/godot-builds/. I could not test that due to unavailable hardware, so I can't offer any support for that.</p>\r\nThird party assets\r\n<p>There are some third party assets included.
