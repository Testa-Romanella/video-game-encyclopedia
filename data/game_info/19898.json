The more it eats, the bigger it gets! Soon you'll be able to eat the entire planet!<br/><br/>The story begins with the goo eating a time machine, causing him to be sent back in time. Playing as the goo, you'll eat your way through six different time periods: modern, Late Cretaceous (i.e. dinosaurs), Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, Feudal Japan, and the distant future. Each time period features a unique set of objects for you to eat. Mice, cats, Tyrannosaurus Rex, mummies, gladiators, and flying saucers are just a few of the hundreds of objects available for consumption.<br/><br/>Levels can span vastly different object sizes; in one level you'll grow all the way from the size of an amoeba to the size of a galaxy. A complete 2-player cooperative game is also included so you'll be able to play the entire game with a friend. After completing the main game you'll unlock a ton of bonus levels that provide additional challenge.<br/><br/><strong>Levels</strong><br/>There are almost 50 levels in the main story mode of the game. There are also nearly 50 bonus levels - these include completely new levels and challenging versions of previous levels.<br/><br/><strong>Controller Support</strong><br/>Keyboard and mouse controls are supported in all modes.<br/>On Windows, most controllers will work for the single player game. To use controllers in 2-player coop mode, both controllers need to be Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers.<br/>On Mac, PS3 and PS4 controllers are supported.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Eat your way through six time periods<br/></li><li>Hundreds of tasty things to eat<br/></li><li>Play the game with a friend in cooperative mode<br/></li><li>Try the bonus mode and play even more levels<br/></li><li>Grow from a microscopic goo to a gigantic planet-gobbling goo</li></ul><br/>Eat your way through time in Tasty Planet: Back for Seconds.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T13:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87f1fa6f2bb2b3361e8f2c41a220bea.jpg", "website": "http://www.dingogames.com/tasty-planet-back-for-seconds/", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Dingo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dingo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
