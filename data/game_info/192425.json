Once passed, it moves into the build room which is what the weapon will be made from and then onto testing for an outcome of the weapons capabilities. Once all stages are passed by you (from visiting each room for each stage of development) just (possibly) sit back and watch the money (maybe) roll in!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952a68002021147819195d9652f1f47f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spin-down"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
