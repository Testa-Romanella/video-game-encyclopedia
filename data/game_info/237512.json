Version one has 75 brain busting levels which get progressively harder as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Unlike other puzzle games, you can use any finger to do the swiping.<br/><br/>There are no time limits nor any lives in the game. There are infinite retries which make the game relaxing to play.<br/><br/>Fun for all ages.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e13e35ab3baf10e417ae784e4166db1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["John Mullan"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["John Mullan"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
