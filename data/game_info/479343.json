By shooting arrows loaded with string, the player can 'rewind' the spool of string, dragging the arrow back towards themselves. This allows the player to be able to pull objects towards them, or use their bow as a grappling hook, all by 'rewinding' the string attached to the arrow. The player can also combat enemies by pulling objects to fall on top of enemies, or simply yanking/dragging objects into hostiles.</p>\n<p>The game has several puzzles and three boss battles, all with unique mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc0cc4708c515b0d1e7a23cf155827d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chichu"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
