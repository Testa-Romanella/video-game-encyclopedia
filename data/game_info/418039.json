It uses tile-based gameplay which allows each user to pick a square depending on where the user clicks on the screen. The user will be able to pick which letter goes first, and then the game proceeds on like any normal game of Tic Tac Toe. The winner is based on getting three letters in a row in any direction, but a tie may occur if both of the players are skilled enough.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39d6e9b767fc47d16a3d726d4f736e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KyleJordon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
