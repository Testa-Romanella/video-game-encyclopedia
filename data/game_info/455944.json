You must stay focused on the game or you won't be able to beat it</p>\n<p>Game mechanics.<br/>The game consists in that you must use the arrow keys of the keyboard or press the arrows that appear on the screen if you are in touch mode, to turn the wheel that has the colors. At the top of the launcher, the next color appears. You must turn the wheel until it matches that color before the pitcher drops the ball. You will have to catch it with the color. If you don't, you will lose a life.<br/>When the launcher lights up in yellow, you must be alert and you must move the wheel in the opposite direction, taking the prize catcher down to grab it.<br/>Very few people have beaten the ruletrix, guess how long you need to do it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47c/47c71edf4003d39d85a9ebe4de7d27f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RGesell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
