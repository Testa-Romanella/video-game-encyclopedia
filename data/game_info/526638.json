Bust your way through the asteroid belt and get revenge on the Solar System!</p>\n<p>Pressing the Orbit button will slow you down and cause all bullets that graze past you to become stuck in your orbit, ready to be fired back out at your enemies. You don't have any weapons\u00a0of your own, so you have to use the enemies' against them!</p>\n<p>Its an endless game mode, so try and get as far as you can and reach a high score. After enough levels, you'll also have to fight a planetary boss.<br/>I spent the last month making this for the Game Off Jam, I'm happy with the result and eager to add more features such as all the planets as bosses at a later date.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>WASD or arrows: movement<br/>Left Click- Orbit mode + reveal hitbox<br/>Left Click release- Fire\u00a0<br/>Right Click- Dash</p>\n<p>Meteors only get caught\u00a0in your Orbit mode if they aren't aiming directly at you. They need to \"graze\" the player in order to be picked up, meaning they pass by you closely.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Pipotchi/MRM2</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Pipotchi- Art, Coding (https://twitter.com/m3smay)<br/>Sirkoto51- Music\u00a0(https://freesound.org/people/Sirkoto51/)<br/>nebulousflynn- SFX (https://freesound.org/people/nebulousflynn/)</p>\n<p>Using these sounds under:<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e079db10195190e56b7b3cc2ec87240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["pipotchi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
