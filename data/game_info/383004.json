Well now you can find out! We created this game as an entry for the Mix and Game Jam, which has a theme of converting games from one dimension to another (3D to 2D or vice versa). Our game follows the story of a kid who happens to have some nightmares with monsters, and telekinetic abilities mimicking that of the gravity gun. We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Also: Yes. We know.
