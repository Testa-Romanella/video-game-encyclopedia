Survive long enough to research a cure for the plague afflicting your city.</p>\n<p>Made for Godot Wildjam #18 using Godot version 3.2, the theme was Plague, and we used the sub-themes\u00a080s tech aesthetic and random chance. Source available at\u00a0https://github.com/iwilliams/PlagueDistrict. Our scope was a bit too large for the amount of time we were able to dedicate to the jam. It's more of a prototype then a full game, the balancing isn't quite right, but you can still click around and play.<br/></p>\n<p>Ian Williams\u00a0@ianawill: Programming and game design</p>\n<p>Izumi Thorn\u00a0@thornIzumi: Music/SFX and game design</p>\n<p>Saina Shayanjoo\u00a0@saina_shayan: Illustrations</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/010c2cad0dd04c31449acd07ff0a05cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["iwilliams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
