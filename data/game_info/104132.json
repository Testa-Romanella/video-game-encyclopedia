It is an interactive experience, created for PC and MAC and supporting Oculus Rift VR and HTC VIVE.</p>\n<p><em>Progetto Ustica</em> recreates the main events of the 50 minutes flight of the ITAVIA DC9 shot down from the sky over the Tyrrhenian Sea at 8:58 PM on June 27, 1980.</p>\n<p>The exact chain of events was never confirmed. The facts are still highly controversial but what we know with a fair amount of certainty from legal and technical evaluations is that the DC9 was shot down by a military missile that killed 77 passengers and 4 crew members. Several military aircrafts were most likely involved: one or two Libyan Mig23; two Italian F104 that crossed the DC9 course a few minutes before it started plummeting; two unidentified aircrafts that engaged in a military operation and shot down the DC9 by mistake.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME</strong></p>\n<p><em>Progetto Ustica</em> puts the player inside the DC9 shortly after its take off, from a first person point of view. The player explores its cabin, interacts with objects and people, and finds several objects that unlock additional features:</p>\n<ul><li>new points of view, freely selectable by the player, that show what is happening from the perspective of the military aircrafts, a radar vision that encompasses the whole scenario, a lone nocturnal fisherman watching the sky, and more;</li><li>audio transcripts of that night radio communications, both between the DC9 and the control towers contacted during the flight and between military aircrafts and their control centers;</li><li>contextual information on the military activity in the Tyrrhenian Sea, new hints on events of that night and on what followed: investigations, cover-ups, suspicious deaths, and more.</li></ul>\n<p>The player retraces the events of that night through multiple points of view, each one contributing to build a different path among several possible cameras.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Progetto Ustica</em> is not intended as a scientifically accurate recreation of facts, or as an investigative game that aims at discovering the truth.</p>\n<p><em>Progetto Ustica</em> is a game for memory. some details of the scenario are true, others are plausible. we leave the player the task to further research and not to forget.</p>\n<p>The game is now in development. It will be published in Q4 2017.</p>\n<p>Realized in collaboration with Associazione Parenti Vittime della Strage di Ustica.</p>\n<p>Follow us on <strong>www.facebook.com/progettoustica</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Read our dev diary - in Italian for now - on <strong>www.progettoustica.it</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f20e424c0c7ffae93d7c249a1a81c08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["IV Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
