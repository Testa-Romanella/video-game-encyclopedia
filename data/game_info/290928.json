React to various situations... you never know what&#39;s gonna happen: annoyed neighbours, problematic tenants, police involved?

The better it looks, the more money you make.<br />\nInvest wisely to achieve maximum profit. Keep an eye out for the best bargain, and strike when you see an opportunity. Are you into risky deals, or you just want to play it safe? The choice is yours!<br />\nBecome a landlord and get involved in real-estate. You are the one in the driver&#39;s seat.
