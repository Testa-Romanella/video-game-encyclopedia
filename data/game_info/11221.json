I think you will try to find a reason why you are here. Hmm.. Go ahead and try.. But if you can't do it just ask me. I always there in places like that. Always live over the wall, the next ward.. And I have a Secret.. Please, don't tell anyone.. I put it in the box for new ward tenants under their beds. No matter how you turn that box, the Secret will try to get out. And yes! You still want to know how to escape? I will help you.. But please, in that case don't believe the doctors.. They don't want me to help, they are afraid of our friendship.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Original gameplay (indirect interaction with one of characters, you can control the beetle by turning the space).<br/></li><li> Oldschool graphic stylistic.<br/></li><li> Lack of fourth wall (you are the main character, not the guy on the screen or running beetle)<br/></li><li> Gravitational puzzles and, of course, your new friend that lives over the wall..
