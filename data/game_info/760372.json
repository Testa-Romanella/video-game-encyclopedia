Escape the mine by running up towards the light while avoiding large boulders. There is a countdown timer until the mine completely collapses. Collect BLUE crystals to increase your time. If you do not collect any blue crystals, you will probably die. <br/><br/>Stick to the left for a slightly easier route. The right side is for those who want more of a challenge.
