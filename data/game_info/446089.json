Dwarves are built more for sprints, not marathons. Luckily, you may find some leftover beer to keep your stout heart going.</p>\n\n<p>GOBLINS</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, they are spread out in search for food. But the scent of the dwarf lures more and more of these filthy beasts each day. They cannot be attacked, so you must avoid them!</p>\n\n\n<p>The Keep</p>\n\n\n<p>Get to the keep, and progress to the next day. This is where you may rest, but you will soon feel the days grow longer as the hordes of goblins swarm these caverns.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:57:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dcd7749fa90cb224479e7738b298e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mamzgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
