However, the simplicity that Godot provides is comfortable for me, and I would rather make this version better than making spagetti code in another engine.</em></p>\r\nTODO\r\n<ul>\n<li>Timer</li>\n<li>Map/checkpoint editor</li>\n<li>Leaderboard</li>\n<li>Multiplayer (Steam)</li><li>MacOS release</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/6868c3a16b8306c082aff94efbf678e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Zede"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
