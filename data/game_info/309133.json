For now we're only working on the local Tournament part.</p>\n<p>An online mode might\u00a0<strong>only</strong>\u00a0be consider\u00a0if the game/ prototype get enough attention from players (it's difficult and takes time to do).</p>\n<p>The prototype(s) is available for free (+ donation soon if you wish to while we'll be working on it).\u00a0 We will try to release a new version at least once every three months.<br/><br/>If a final game version is one day release, the same \"free to play + donation\" approach\u00a0should be kept. (so\u00a0 the maximum of players can still enjoy the game, while helping us if they can or want to). But that might change too. We're not there yet anyway.<br/><br/>The menus are available in five languages already! Contact us if you wish to help and add yours.
