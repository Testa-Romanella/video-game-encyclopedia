And then the people you hire get all sweaty and gross and what are you supposed to do with them? Well you can go ahead and fire them because we have the solution for you! With Factorama, you have the ability to create and manage your own fully automated factories! In no time you'll never have to worry about sweaty humans again, and won't that be great?</p>\n<p>Factorama is a Factory building game where your goal is to generate as much dough as possible. There are several machines for you to use, and dozens of items you can produce and sell. We even have multiple game modes so that if you want to be a lazy couch potato and not worry about money, then no problem you can. Or you could be a hardcore entrepreneur and never leave your Factories side.
