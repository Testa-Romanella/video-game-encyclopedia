In game you are interdimensional farmer who can travel between different seasons. Each time you change season by going in on of the direction indicated by text on the map new season specific environment's being generated. At this very early alpha build you are carrying three items from the beginning of the game: tree seeds, wheat seeds and a cauldron. Game is about figuring out what you can do with theses items in different seasons so i.e. plant a tree in the summer, wait for it to grow, and go to autumn to take and eat an apple, because you will start starving quickly. But there's something more, placed items are persisting between seasons so be aware of spending too much time on winter biome or your plants will going to inevitably perish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Movement : WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Placing Items; F\u00a0- sapling, G - wheat, H - cauldron.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a2837e25e65730a604c5fd56af432c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MichalDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
