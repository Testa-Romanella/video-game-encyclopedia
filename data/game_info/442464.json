The controls are \"right arrow key to move right, left arrow key to move left, and up arrow key to jump\". There is a bug where sometimes you get stuck in the ground after jumping, so to get out of that, just jump and move until it stops.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a8631e0bd69e0dfc536f4c57d802729f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xXhomiespongeXx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
