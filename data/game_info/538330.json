With the lab closed due to the pandemic, we created a virtual gallery for this year\u2019s show. Our inspiration was the lab itself; we set out to recreate it but, during that process, solid walls gave way to abstract spaces. That transition from physical to surreal is reflected in the layout \u2013\u00a0which will take you from an arcade-inspired gallery all the way to outer space! There are three spaces to explore: HELLO WORLD, ZOOM ROOM, and SPACEPLOITATION. The design of each room is defined by the works featured within.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy and don't forget to explore and play the games here and download the catalogue of the show here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d8c5974841340d428628d56ebd353de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MICA Game Lab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
