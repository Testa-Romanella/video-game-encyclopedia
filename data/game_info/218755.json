Your goal in this simple, dynamic and easy to learn game, is to get the box all the way to the finish line. What makes this interesting, the only thing you control is the box\u2019s color, switching to black for as long as you are tapping. Why even bothering switching from white to black? Because you can only pass obstacles if they are the same colour as you. As soon as a black little box comes up next, tap the screen until you passed it.
