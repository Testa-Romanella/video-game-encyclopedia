Find a way out as fast as you can, but beware - its defense systems will try to stop you from leaving alive by any means necessary...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD - move</p>\n<p>Z - Shoot (will fire in the direction that you move in)<br/></p>\n<p>X - Strafe (when shooting while strafing, you will fire in the direction you are facing instead)</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay and Features<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- Procedural generation - maneuver your way through a map that changes every run</p>\n<p>- Light mechanics - the darkness can be disturbed by both you and your enemies (take advantage of this)</p>\n<p>- Sound cues - when you can't see, hearing is half the battle; listen carefully to prevent yourself from being caught off guard<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- this game was made for the Retrograde Jam 3 (this is supposed to be like one of those arcade games where you put in a coin and see how far you can get)</p>\n<p>- I recommend downloading the Windows or Linux version if you can; the web version works if you're not using any of those systems but it's a little slow</p>\n<p>- the game is supposed to be somewhat  Nintendo Hard, but also relatively short (beatable in under 30 minutes to \u00a0an hour)</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Tips (Recommend reading this if you're struggling)\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Room part:</p>\n<p>- your torch has a limited amount of light (~ 10 minutes), but in practice, you are unlikely to run out, so take some time to plan your moves<br/></p>\n<p>- enemies need to wait about two seconds before they can shoot again; if you know where they are, you can bait them into shooting before running</p>\n<p>- you may use all your ammo here if you wish, as you will not need it for the boss</p>\n<p>Boss:</p>\n<p>- your gun is pretty much useless for this part since you cannot kill the boss, although it can be used as an emergency light source</p>\n<p>- the boss will shoot faster the further you run, but its charging period will always be the same; when you hear the charging sound, try to get between the columns of spikes right when the boss shoots so that you will have room to dodge<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T11:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda806c76d8f90b381625101a494dc67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Incognito_User"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
