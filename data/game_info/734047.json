Keep them away by throwing pebbles and boulders at them, but make sure you don't hit your friendly Red Squirrels who are searching for more nuts in the forest -\u00a0or they will be knocked out and won't be able to help gather nuts for a while.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>A/D:</strong> Move around<strong><br/>LMB:</strong> Throw pebble / Boulder<br/><strong>RMB: </strong>Dig out boulder</p>\n<p>Hold down LMB to charge into a higher arc to lob it over your friends' heads. Remember that with a bit of practice you can throw rocks at your other rocks and boulders to alter their velocity and trajectory! If your final nut is stolen, you lose the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Good luck!</em></p>\r\nScoring:\r\n<p>When you defeat an enemy squirrel, you'll get as many points as you have nuts stored.</p>\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<ul><li>Please refresh the game between attempts, a bug is causing the game not to reset your score to zero when starting a new game.</li><li>If at the leaderboard, you can't see your score you just submitted, even if it's top ten - go to main menu and then back to leaderboard and it should've updated correctly!</li><li>The leaderboard somehow sometimes submit the score without the name, cause unknown. <strong>If this happens to you, tell us what\u00a0 score was yours and we'll put in your name manually!</strong></li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Programmers:\u00a0</strong>Robin Toller Hovler / Jonas Pannee</p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0</strong>Sandra Caraan / Edvin Edenhage<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/155/1558cf0014d59fc21f440c65ec3886cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robin Toller Hovler", "Edvin Edenhage", "Trashcandogchoir", "Sandora.Ka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
