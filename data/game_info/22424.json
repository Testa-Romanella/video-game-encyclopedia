Live on the fringes of society and pick the bones of the fallen. Become a miner and trawl the constellation for exotic ores. Take the fight to wherever you choose, hunting pirates and renegades from port to port.<br/><br/>You choose what ship to use, what metal to make it out of, what equipment to put on it.  You choose what to specialise in, the more you play the better you become, the more you use something the better it becomes.  You choose where to go, what missions to take, where to fly and when.  There are threats, the unforgiving cartel, unstable wreckage and even mining asteroids can be lethal.  Never fly alone with local co-operative play.<br/>Space Salvager:Live your own epic space adventure!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5af/5afd2cb51625d9d12e8115f6b2525c1a.jpg", "website": "http://2persongames.wordpress.com/space-salvager/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 62}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Albon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sam Albon"], "esrb_rating": null}
