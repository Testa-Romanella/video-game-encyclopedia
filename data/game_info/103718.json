For those who haven't played the original, yes, there is actually a space whale in it.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move! No other controls, whatever the on-screen indicators might make you think.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is made with Bitsy by Adam Le Doux, plus a lot of custom code this time. Special thanks go as ever to Sean S. LeBlanc, for his invaluable JavaScript assistance, and to Lenny Magner for the code that runs the timer. Em was the one-slime playtesting squad.<br/></p>\n<p>Aseprite\r\n\u00a0was defintely worth the money.</p>\n<p>For anyone curious, the speedrun timer starts as you get out of the bed, and stops as soon as the Space Whale's dialogue box appears. And yes, it's entirely in there because this jam overlapped with Summer Games Done Quick 2018.</p>\n<p>For those about to ask \"how did you do the (X)?\" a comprehensive dev log for this one is defintely coming.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d2/0d27afd888971c92294c827b7e6f3933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["verticalblanking"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
