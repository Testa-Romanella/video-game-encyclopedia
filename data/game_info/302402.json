Obviously you can also kill enemies with it. :)</p>\n<p>Every planet that you see, you can visit... and every planet is a level with an energetic orb that you need to collect in order to get away with your brother!<br/>If you aren't able to pass a level change the planet, collect an orb and give it to Elliott at the spaceship: he will give you some power up that help you pass harder levels.</p>\n<p>The game was made in 96 hours for a jam, so forgive me if there are some bugs!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n<br/>- \"A\" and \"D\" to\u00a0move (you can move even in mid-air).\r\n<br/>- Mouse click to shoot. Aim at the ground and shoot multiple times to jump.<br/>- \"R\" to reset if you got stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0<br/>A game made by\u00a0<strong>havana24.net\u00a0<br/></strong>Follow me on twitter\u00a0<strong>@hav24\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff4b48a733a0503b1d432fb4418b2b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Havana24"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
