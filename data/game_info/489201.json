{"id": 489201, "slug": "three-primes", "name": "Three Primes", "name_original": "Three Primes", "description": "<p>Three Primes is a game about alchemy, exploration, and discovery. Find the elements hidden around your laboratory and create alchemical elixirs to affect yourself and the environment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Try exploring the lab or creating a potion using the elements by your table. Some potions have an effect when you drink them, some can be used to activate objects, and some can be used either of these ways. Search the scrolls for hints into the alchemist's activities and the true nature of the elements. <br/></p>\n<p>Your feedback is valuable! If you play the game, please let us know what you think. Your donations will allow us to improve the puzzles and develop the game even further, adding features like controller support, a save function, additional potions, secrets, and more. We hope you have fun exploring the alchemy lab and we look forward to creating more interactive experiences in the future. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89af871df4eb55a1ba556e2380248689.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Three Prime Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
