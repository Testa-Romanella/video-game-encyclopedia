{"id": 914732, "slug": "one-year-old-catch", "name": "One-Year-Old Catch", "name_original": "One-Year-Old Catch", "description": "<p>One-Year-Old Catch also called \"\u6293\u5468 Zhuazhou\", literally, \"pick\" and \u201canniversary\", is a Chinese ritual held at a child's first birthday party, when the child is 1 year, i.e. typically twelve months after birth, old. The parents put various objects before the child. Parents will often put objects that symbolize career choices or personality traits. The child's choice is used to forecast its future. This custom is prevalent throughout East Asia, more like a superstition.<br/></p>\n<p>One-Year-Old Catch, as a ceremony to predict the future and temperament, is very regional and Asian. It is very interesting, but it is contrary to the values emphasized in today's modern society. It seems that an item is more or less the future direction of an individual's life Some are unreasonable, which also reflects the idealism in East Asian culture. In general, children do not necessarily follow the path of what they grasped at the beginning of life, nor does their future become what they grasped when they grasped it.\r\n</p>\n<p>One-Year-Old Catch is a microcosm of East Asian culture, and this ritual also reflects the deprivation of individuality that is prevalent in East Asian cultural circles, where individual expression is repressed and the child must be the object of unconditional obedience, which robs the individual of his or her sense of self. Unfortunately, this is a logic that is deeply ingrained in many East Asian parents.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Rules\uff1a</strong>(1) Click to start;\u00a0(2) Select an item;\u00a0(3) Display the occupation corresponding to the item;\u00a0(4) Select again/Exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T15:49:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/950b1d244997c4b7e47c03c49eb9d194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lianqi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
