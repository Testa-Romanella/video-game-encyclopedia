In the series of missions, combine robotic modular geometry components into different structures to adapt to combat situations. Build ground defenses around, send propeller air probes, attract and transfer scrap resources, and anything else the physics allows. Clean up anything unwanted to complete the maintenance task.<br/> <br/> <br/>Crazy physics-based gameplay99% of the stuff is physically simulated, affecting how objects move and behave in action. Consider physical phenomenon when making strategic decisions. e.g The bullet bounces off non-targets. Obstacles or drones can physically affect opponent rushing in. Structural balancing...Strategy focused, multipurpose robotic components for fast in-place live constructionThings are made of robotic components which can be served for multiple purposes. This allows for fast building of functional small structures in realtime with pause. There is also no upgrading of things such as ground defense towers, just modify them or build more onto them to adapt to new situation.Open and reusable game mechanicsObjects will be reusable for other purpose/or have additional usage with more sandbox elements introduced.Experiment, sandbox and survival modesExperiment mode (aka. campaign) explores a wide range of gameplay with robotic component combinations, including expansionary defense, conquest and production etc. <br/>Sandbox supports building and testing of varies structural designs with large material supply and completing additional challenges. <br/>Survival mode is fortress defense.Clean metallic esthetics, floating high in atmosphere.The clean style matches the sci-fi background while giving clear visual on structural design. Also supports colorbindness.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e58270a6500df5069ea72041974472c.jpg", "website": "http://labtd.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laboratory Systems"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamera Game", "Laboratory Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
