In New Era, a new protagonist travels to completely new locations and meets along the way both old enemies familiar to us since 2003 and new monsters that never were in any PC game in the series before. At the same time, we have retained the main advantages of the original Alien Shooter: the linearity of the plot, the classic weapons and character leveling systems, the game economy and balance, and also improved the Survival mode, making it even more exciting.<br />\nWe hope that with the help of Alien Shooter 2 New Era, you will be able to return to your 2003 at least for a while and enjoy the game. :)<br />\nThank you for playing with us!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T09:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535e522567bf9b35cd7166b86cca2b05.jpg", "website": "http://www.sigma-team.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sigma Team"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sigma Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
