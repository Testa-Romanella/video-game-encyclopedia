These Words have power: they can change the rules of the world around you and help you brave the harsh elements on your path. But beware: changing those rules might benefits your enemies! You\u2019ll have to use the right Words, at the right time, to reach the end of your journey.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><em>The Last Word</em>\u00a0is an infinite runner (with levels): you do not control the avatar that you see on the screen. Whatever you do, she will run. She might encounter obstacles, though, and that\u2019s where you come in. Use your keyboard to change the rules of the world around her. Each rule has a key attached to it, displayed to its left in the UI: that is the key you need to press. As long as a key is pressed, the rule is changed. Once you release the key, the rule comes back to normal.</p>\r\nGoal of the game\r\n<p>You play an entity who has an interest in this little girl finding more Words. What is that entity looking for?
