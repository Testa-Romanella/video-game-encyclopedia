Use other tiles that appear every turn to catapult yourself to other areas of the puzzle board.

Get to the exit in as few moves as possible. Use other tiles, but do watch out! Tiles of similar color that meet will leave only a singular tile of that color. Watch out too for black tiles that move only in the direction of the arrows found on them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e0877bb728b8cf515f84ac4e67794d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gameswarp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
