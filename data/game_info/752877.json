Use your wits and your special bug powers to navigate fields, tall-grass, mud wallows, and perilous waters. Don't let the creeps get too close (unless you're feeling hungry)! Survive 30 short levels to reunite with your friends and family.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>-Simple, turn-based puzzles with the strategic movement and resource conversation of a classic roguelike. <br/>-Juicy ability cards to keep creeps on their toes.<br/>-Short &amp; sweet. 30 bite-sized procedurally-generated levels per playthrough.<br/>-Bug sounds!<br/>-Catchy but repetitive MIDI soundtrack you can turn off in the settings.<br/>-All mouse input<br/></p>\r\n Built in a week for 7DRL 2022\r\n<p>So likely a little, uh, buggy.\u00a0My hope is to keep polishing it up post-jam! Please don't hesitate to reach out or comment with feedback, issues, etc. <br/><br/>P.S. If you're a first-timer player, I'd suggest clicking \"learn\" on the start menu and following the tutorial til you get in the swing of things! &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39cc2826d12c5438baa612377cdb1597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["-hexcavator-"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
