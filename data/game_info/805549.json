The closer you are to each other the stronger the link becomes, dealing more damage, But if you got tooo far away the link breaks dealing no damage. The game requires from the two players to move in a harmony, balancing between being too far and dealing little damage or being too close and not covering enough area to damage. The game is in a pixilated style.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T16:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54cb53f1ff8d8ea441e335dc9a63283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Issa Al-Salmi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
