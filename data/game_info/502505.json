In this game four players venture through a maze to find the treasure in the center of the map. There are 2 teams of 2 and each team shares one flashlight that they will have to pass to each other so make sure you communicate and share. To win you and your teammate\u00a0must BOTH get to the treasure before the other team does (There is no win screen or popup). Have fun and explore! Also the collision is buggy so make sure not to touch any sharp edges.</p>\n<p>Team 1 Controls:</p>\n<p>Player 1: Use WASD to move</p>\n<p>Player 2: Use GVBN to move</p>\n<p>Use F to pass light</p>\n<p>Team 2 Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Player 1: Use 9IOP to move</p>\n<p>Player 2: Use arrows to move<br/></p>\n<p>Use L to pass\u00a0light<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/7962afb7ae0b47c9d942f0a64d6496f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PieHunter29"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
