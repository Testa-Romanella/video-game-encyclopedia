Call Me Under takes place in the mysterious underwater city of Styx, a haven inhabited by humans, sirens, and a host of unknown otherworldly entities. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur demo is a very early example of what you will see in the final game, with many elements and features still a work in progress. We created this preview with the intent of introducing you to the characters and giving you a peek into the world of Styx, and we look forward to bringing you an incredible game when completed!  Blue is the only character that is voiced in the demo, but all seven of our main characters will be in the completed game. The game will be available on PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch upon release.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T03:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/84625b3aa46e9120874b20ae518d340e.jpg", "website": "https://www.lunarisgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunaris Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lunaris Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
