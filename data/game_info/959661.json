Buy and sell an unknown stock using its real, historic data - beginning from a random time in the past, trading the asset using only technical analysis concepts gained along the way. Learn fundamentals of how to trade based solely on patterns and technical indicators, gradually unlocking upgrades which expedite and automate your trading. Borrowing from the mechanics of some \"idle\" and \"roguelike\" games, progress is made by banking funds for future runs after you are margin called, and upgrades can enhance the speed of simulation, increase margin equity, unlock advanced indicators, and per its name, engage automation techniques.<br/><br/>In gamifying a process known as \"backtesting\" in economics, Trade Bots players test their own trading strategies against real, historic stock/ETF/crypto data dating back to as early as the 1950s to present day. Over the course of the campaign, design intricate trading bots using a custom-built visual node editor. The engine is highly flexible and accommodates practically any trading strategy imaginable while requiring no programming background. Advanced unlocks allow for playing with cryptocurrencies, Exchange Traded Funds, and the ability to share your bots with other players.<br/><br/>Features Include:<br/><ul><li>Support for 20+ Technical Indicators]</li><li>100+ Unlockable Upgrades</li><li>Stock, Crypto &amp; ETF Modes</li><li>Ability to Import &amp; Export Bots</li></ul><br/>Trade Bots is developed by Cinq-Mars Media, the non-profit known for the hit [ur=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1014280/The_Devils_Calculator/l]The Devil's Calculator[/url], included in PAX's 10 Best Indie Games of 2019.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T03:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/17648497bb1b6fb1f570318f4b16a337.jpg", "website": "https://cinqmarsmedia.com/tradebots", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cinq-Mars Media"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cinq-Mars Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
