It's a whole new kind of puzzle. A 3x3x3 arrangement of cubelets with the center one missing allows sliding permutations. After a randomization, the goal is to restore the cube to its original configuration based on color and alphabetic hints.</p>\n<p>Dragging the cursor rotates the cube for a better view angle.</p>\n<p>Clicking the cursor on a cubelet adjacent to the empty space will slide it into that empty space. On laptops you may also hit <return> when the cursor is on the cubelet of choice to select and slide it. On MacBooks, a 2-finger tap on the touchpad does the job.</return></p>\n<p>As indicated on screen, <h> will toggle a help screen.</h></p>\n<p>Note that <c> will toggle an alternate skin Color. One looks like a rubic cube coloring, and the other is an RGB coloring where red increases in the X-direction, green increases in the Y-direction, and blue in the Z-direction.</c></p>\n<p>Works on Windows, Macs running OS-X and PCs running GNU/Linux.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946c1f0e6df986e7465023e557e6594f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fastrgv"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
