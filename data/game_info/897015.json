After 2 years of staying inside, running away from the cold embrace of a winter that seems to never end, the brothers decide to go hunting, due to their food running low. However, the cold temperature is not the most dangerous thing out there...</p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\r\nThis game was made in a month for the\u00a0Winter Visual Novel Jam 2022.\r\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>~1.5k words</li><li>3 endings<br/>\n</li><li>A very talkable character</li><li>wind.ogg</li><li>The worst ending to ever exist</li></ul>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first game made in Ren'py. I'm planning to use this game engine some more in the future, so this game jam was the perfect opportunity to mess around with it (I wanted to make a winter themed VN even before discovering this jam, how convenient).</p>\n<p>Also, this was my first game made for a game jam\u00a0(it's becoming a theme by now lol). It was supposed to be a bit better, the story a bit more expanded and the ending overall much better, but I've lost all interest in this game and I didn't felt like working on it anymore. Maybe I'll actually make a quality ending in the future, but I wouldn't count on that (let's just say ending 2 is canon). This experience was painful and I'm never doing this again.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year!</p>\n<p>Don't forget to look out for your younger siblings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T08:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/292/2927b97545ed4c1543b5897a756ad203.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Alxe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
