In these two player versus game you control a sheep and a clown. Move the sheep around using the left joystick gathering cry onomatopoeia. Gathering the onomatopoeia makes your sheep bigger. Deliver the onomatopoeia to the baby's basket to make him cry for the mother's attention. Use the left trigger to do a small dash. You can also move up and down a clown (using the right joystick) that shoots bread (right trigger) to decrease the size and loudness of the next cry. The baby that has cried the most when the time ends wins. You can also when by gaining the mother's full attention (when she gets to the baby's position). <br/></p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Maximiliano Valent\u00edn L\u00f3pez, Jaime El\u00edas Moch\u00e1n Quesnel, Benjam\u00edn Mitl Mart\u00ednez Guerrero, Mariana Zazhil Mart\u00ednez Campos, David Zuratzi Mart\u00ednez Huerta, Felipe Ortiz Ugalde, Gustavo Abraham Doncel de la Torre<br/></p><p><strong>Special thanks:</strong></p><p>Special thanks to Chef Diana L\u00f3pez del R\u00edo for providing us with great food during these lasting hours.
