Please be respectful to other shoppers, and have a great day!\"</em></em></p>\n<p><em>Feeling lonely is natural. The seeking of companionship, the recognition of one's identity or just the odd \"Hey\" could mean the world to someone. Whether they are the shopper of a plaza with a strange amount of advertisement posters or if they are the presence of a graffiti artist just wanting their work to be recognized and appreciated on existing works, the fight against being alone could be just as simple as placing a sticker on something.</em></p>\n\n<p>You play as Spirit, a ghost who haunts a shopping plaza and is facing the difficulties of having no interaction with others ( or at least non-scary paranormal interactions).
