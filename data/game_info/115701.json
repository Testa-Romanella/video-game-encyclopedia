If you let the balloon, \u201cLoonie\u201d, touch the ground or if it gets popped by an obstacle, you fail and have to restart the level. With the added challenge of Loonie in the game, you must be aware of the balloon\u2019s life, as well as your own.</p>\n<p>During each level, in addition to thinking about surviving and completing the level, an<br/>advanced player must worry about their completion time and collecting all the coins<br/>present within the level, in order to get a perfect three star score</p>\n<p>If you enjoy this game please go and give this game some attention at the dev's page here:\u00a0https://neoludo.itch.io/loonie\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090ef323a7f4acfb91e76639accda299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
