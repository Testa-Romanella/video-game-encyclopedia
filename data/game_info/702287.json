{"id": 702287, "slug": "dirty-land", "name": "Dirty Land", "name_original": "Dirty Land", "description": "<strong>Dirty Land</strong> is a game about real estate, crime, and desperation, inspired by classic sales movies of the 80s and 90s.  <br/><br/>Step into the shoes of Frank Marsh, a newly hired salesman for Pure Sky Properties, a real estate office where coffee is for closers and the status quo is hawking swamp land to unsuspecting buyers for a tidy profit. Will you cast aside your ethics for a quick buck, or will you take the high road and find a way to scrape by honestly?<h3>Something New Every Day</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>Welcome to your new job.</strong> At the start of every day, you begin out front of an unassuming, drab strip mall, where Pure Sky Properties is tucked away. Every day brings new characters to meet, new events to experience, and new stories to be told. What will it be tomorrow?<h3>Choose a Lead, Go on a Sit, and Close 'em!</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>These are the new leads.</strong> You'll probably close one of your leads today, but can you close two leads a day? You're gonna need some caffeine for that. But you know what salesmen say about coffee... you better prove your worth if you want that cup of joe!<br/><br/>Every day you'll have chances to make a sale. Learn what they like, study their habits, memorize what you can about them, and get them to sign on the line which is dotted!<h3>The Birth of a Salesman</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>You are Frank Marsh.</strong> You've made a mistake that has ruined your family. You can't change your past, but you can change your future! <br/><br/>Will you take the high road and stick to your principles, or take the low road and chase the easy money? Whichever path you take, you'll discover multiple endings based on the choices you've made and whether you succeed or fail in those choices.<br/><br/>On top of those choices, you'll need to balance your family life with your work life. Will you be a model father and go home and play with your kids? Or will you go out on another sit and close that elusive buyer? Go too far down one path and there will be consequences... your choice will change Frank's story - at work and at home.<h3>Make Friends First, Sales Second</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>An office is a place where dreams come true.</strong> A place to meet lively new people. A sociopathic manager. An elusive owner. An opportunistic coworker out to steal your money. A flamboyant salesman with no concept of failure. A seductive hairdresser. An intrepid drycleaner. A neglected wife. A pair of dumb mob thugs. A ripped-off customer. A brutal detective. A homeless derelict with clues to a mystery. A rival firm across the street. And many more...<h3>Always Be Closing</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>The money is out there.</strong> All you gotta do is reach out and grab it! How many leads can you pitch and sell? Can you bag the top leads? Will you take advantage of easy prey, or tackle deals with honor?<h3>Play the Sleuth</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>Do I have your attention?</strong> Good. Because it's not just sales numbers that you need to keep your eye on.  You need to keep your wits about you, because in an office full of backstabbers, anything can and will happen. Including the surreal!<br/><br/>Clearly you've been framed. But by who?<h3>Solve Murder Mysteries</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>In a desperate world you'll meet desperate people.</strong> Dangerous people. People who will do anything to make rent. To not get fired. To make that promotion. To secure those juicy leads. From unsavory characters to hilarious charmers, they all have secret motives to uncover... you'll need to gather clues and piece together the truth to gain the upper hand in this double-crossing world! <br/><br/>Everyone is a suspect! Especially you! <br/><br/>And this murder won't be the only one...", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b59f72187ec1966e78c3cb0098ff444.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Naturally Intelligent"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Naturally Intelligent"], "esrb_rating": null}
