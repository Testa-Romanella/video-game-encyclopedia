{"id": 397461, "slug": "wend", "name": "Wend", "name_original": "Wend", "description": "<p><em>Wend </em>is a single player, top-down perspective game about exploration in which the player navigates a complex labyrinth, lighting their way with a single torch as they collect relics and wander towards the center. The catch, however,\u00a0is that the brightness and size of the player\u2019s torch light is dependent on their state of motion: the torch burns\u00a0low and small while running through the labyrinth, and burns bright and large when while standing still. Luminescent gems can be found throughout the labyrinth and allow the player to mark their way as they proceed along the dark and mysterious\u00a0paths. The game is intended to\u00a0facilitate feelings of mystery in players as they methodically explore the vast labyrinth and challenge them to apply their memory and spatial awareness skills to uncover ancient relics required to access the secrets that lie at its center.</p>\n\r\nUse movement to illuminate the environment\r\n<p>The player has the ability to control their torch light through the movement mechanics. While moving, only a small radius around their avatar is illuminated, and while stationary their torch is raised automatically to expand this radius to the neighbouring pathways to view a greater portion of the labyrinth.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nPick up and drop gems to create breadcrumb trails\r\n<p>The player may collect emissive gems hidden throughout the labyrinth to help them find their way.\u00a0These gems illuminate a small area around themselves, and, as such, can also be placed back down to create strategic paths to specific areas or landmarks the player deems significant.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nExplore the labyrinth to collect relics and discover the path to the center\r\n<p>Due to the inherent nature of labyrinths as well as the reduced visibility within the environment, players must physically explore much of the area in order to find and collect relics, and navigate to find the exit.\u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game was developed to be played with an\u00a0Xbox controller.\u00a0<strong>Headphones recommended.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the left stick to move around the labyrinth</li><li>Use the right stick to move the camera (only enabled when you're standing still!)</li><li>Press \"A\" to pick up and drop gems, and to collect relics</li><li>Press Start to pause</li></ul>\n\n<p>Keyboard Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Arrow keys to move camera</li><li>\"B\" key for picking up/dropping objects and any other action button prompts</li><li>TAB to pause (arrow keys to navigate menus while paused)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T04:04:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f49fc7cffa867f9dfc852b578db90dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["christabuttera"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
