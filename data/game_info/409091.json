It's your job to keep them in tune and bring music to the ocean's depths. <br/></p>\n<p>When one of the four instruments is broken, you will hear it as the melody will be out of tune. You'll have to identify which instrument has failed, and play its sequence back to it in order to fix it. <br/>If your submarine's melody is out of tune, water will start filling up the inside of your vessel. You lose if your ship fills up completely with water. </p>\n<p>It's your job to keep the music going for as long as you can!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> WASD to move, mouse to look around, Left Mouse click to interact with instruments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T04:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f33/f33fab79a4f92247c305b4fbbd6172f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gamechuck", "Winged Adventurer", "Lazanja", "resonantflux"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
