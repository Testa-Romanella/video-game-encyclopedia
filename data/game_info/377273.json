Inspired heavily on nuclear throne and Enter the Gungeon, Dungeons &amp; Cats is a short demo made in 5 months by four 16-year-old guys who like programming and pixel art. We would be really glad if you could give us a chance, testing our game and telling what you think of it in the comments. If you find any bug or weird thing in our game, we would be very pleased to hear what you have to say to us.<br/> The game is composed of 4 procedurally generated levels, and your mission is to kill all the enemies coming in waves at every level, reaching the end. You can dash pressing the right mouse button, and attack with your staff using the left mouse button.\u00a0<br/> The art of the game is composed by some art we did and also some pixel art we used from other remarkable artists , such as Robert:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii<br/>and Daniel Linssen<br/>https://managore.itch.io/m5x7</p>\n<p> We hope you enjoy playing ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc25057a86d3f40ab2e811bebe6092b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChatSaiko"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
