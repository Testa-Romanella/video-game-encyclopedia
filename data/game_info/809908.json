You play as a hungry\u00a0penguin who ate the town's only fishing rod, and now must use it to support their rapid growth. Try to collect all the fish while surviving to get a new high score in this arcade fishing mashup inspired by Bird &amp;\u00a0Beans.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Two play modes:\u00a0Classic and Advanced</li><li>Optional but intuitive crank controls</li><li>16 unique fish to catch</li><li>High score tracking\u00a0</li><li>30 FPS on device (most of the time)</li></ul>\r\nLeaderboards &amp; Feedback\r\n<p>Submit your high scores or any feedback you have for me on the Google form\u00a0here! I will compile and post the top scores to this page at the end of every month.\u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay tips\r\n<ul><li><strong>Classic mode</strong>:\u00a0Use your fishing rod tongue to\u00a0catch fish early for more points! Use the <strong>A button or crank</strong> to cast the line.<ul><li>A button controls require better timing but are quicker to use</li><li>Crank controls\u00a0are more precise but can be slower to use<ul><li>Rotate the crank clockwise (forward) to cast from the vertical position.</li><li>Each time the crank is reset to the vertical position, the line can be cast again.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Advanced mode</strong>:\u00a0control a\u00a0<strong>vacuum tank</strong> and suck in multiple fish at once for more points. You have six uses before your battery needs to charge, which happens as you move or score 3+ combos.<ul><li>Use the <strong>crank</strong> to aim and the <strong>up button</strong> to suck.</li><li>Alternatively, dock the crank and use\u00a0<strong>A\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>up\u00a0</strong>to use the vacuum at a fixed 45 degree angle.</li></ul></li><li>Not all fish require skillful play to catch! You always have the chance to\u00a0see a rare fish appear at a lower score threshold than normal.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Programming and design</strong>: Mac Vogelsang<br/>\n<strong>Music</strong>: royalty free (by Hupple)<br/>\n<strong>Sounds</strong>: royalty free from zapsplat.com <br/>\n<strong>Misc. textures and assets</strong>: 1-bit textures by VectorPixelStar and building sprites by Rad Potato\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game engine is adapted from\u00a0my\u00a0Bird &amp; Beans port which can be found on here on\u00a0Github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a38/a38a62308424ea088bd957c01af96787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vogelscript"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
