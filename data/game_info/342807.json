This objective isn't to win but to learn a lesson. It simulates when something goes wrong in a person's life and it can seem that everything is spiralling out of control and we are stuck in a bad situation.</p><p>This is done by the game starting and it keeps pushing the character up towards the baseline. It can seem like a meaningless game , however, an important feature this is yet to be implemented are the things in the background that can be clicked.\u00a0</p><p>This is just a reminder to everyone to still enjoy life and appreciate its beauty. Yes there are times when things are bad but our mindset and attitude changes everything. Once clicked, the moving blocks slow down and the player is transported to another level (that is yet to be implemented).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e301cba2deb772a2989c5c5e73a79a30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["W-KE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
