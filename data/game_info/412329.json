You press right and both players go right.<br/>BUT you can only see one world!<br/>If one player dies, the level restarts.<br/>Every time the player loses in a parallel world, you will see it for a brief moment.<br/>You\u2019ll have to draw a mental map of a parallel world and play both levels at the same time.</p>\n<p>There are 3 difficulties:<br/>Confused (easy) you can see the parallel world at any time<br/>Dissonance (normal \u2013 intended difficulty) you can see the parallel world when you lose<br/>Schizophrenia (hard) you can\u2019t see the parallel world at all</p>\n<p>Current game name is Cognitive Dissonance. (might change later)<br/>While it is a puzzle platformer, it is also a metaphor on being lost in your own self. It is about difficulties in making complex life decisions. It is about being scared of the future and not understanding what is the right thing to do. When you start each level, the main character will display his thoughts in a textbox above the level.<br/>As you play a game, he will become more sure in his decisions and in the end meat and unite with himself from the other world.<br/>(the lore is not very clean. We didn\u2019t discuss it much. This is just a general theme.)<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nSomething like that <br/></p>\n<p>The game is unfinished but we will make sure to finish it later and hopefully publish it on Steam!</p>\n\n<p>For the Full Moon Game Jam.
