Although this game is extremely similar to the original game, it is just a demo and new and far more original additions will be in the full version once it is done.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left click to shoot, right click to lay mine, WASD to move, and use mouse to aim.</p><p>Current Known Bugs: Collision with shells and corners of walls is a bit buggy but not game breaking. Killing the last tank and yourself at the same time (ie. with a mine)\u00a0causes current mission to increment but still makes you replay the mission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f3/2f393310456579d77fecfb8ad5899a9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorLobsterPHD"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
