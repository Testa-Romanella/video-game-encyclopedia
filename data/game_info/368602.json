You control a space junker in a top-down perspective, travelling to debris fields of destroyed space stations and ships in order to reclaim valuable cargo. Only problem is, the security systems still work, aliens have taken over the area, and there may be other scavengers trying to stake a claim as well.</p>\n<p>The game is in mid-alpha development, meaning that almost all of the core functionality is complete, and I\u00a0am now working on additional content to add more depth to the gameplay.</p>\n<p>Note: There is a Save/Load function, however I\u00a0am unsure if it will work across different versions of the game. I apologize for any inconvenience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:27:45", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DamienJS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
