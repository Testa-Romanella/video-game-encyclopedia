How the weather then developes is \u2013 out of your control.</p>\n<p>There are no sounds, and the scoring system is bugged. You could say that those things are now \u2013 out of <em>my</em> control. :)</p>\n<p>Controls: mouse, left button</p>\n<p>Tips: </p>\n<p>\u2013 Regrettably, the casting system is inconsistent. The upwards pointing arrow increases temperature, and the downwards pointing arrow decreases it. The third symbol increases pressure, if not used with temperature change. Otherwise it increases humidity.</p>\n<p>\u2013 You get a much better score if you get the weather \"right\" than with correct temperature. However, the system is bugged and imbalanced, as getting the \"right\" weather is super easy. I suggest you try to find your own fun. The scores are not saved anywhere after you close the game.<br/></p><p>\u2013 Temperature increase and decrease cancel each other out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:34:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba573342598afa7e39f16ee30630cd3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shedd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
