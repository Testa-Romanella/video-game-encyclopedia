In\u00a0<strong><em>Cell Theory</em></strong>, create a simulation by\u00a0placing grids on the screen, and press SPACE to see your simulation come to life! There are TONS of combinations, so there are\u00a0pretty much endless possibilities (how fun).</p>\n<p>The game, while sort of not original, has some new stuff to offer.\u00a0What are those new stuff, you ask? Well...</p>\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW?\r\n<p>There's still the normal game mode, but there\u00a0are also 3 BRAND NEW game modes in\u00a0<strong><em>Cell Theory</em></strong> that completely change the rules of the simulation. New properties can emerge from...</p>\n<ul><li><strong>MULTIMODE:\u00a0</strong>Cells are immortal, causing them to grow at an alarming rate.</li><li><strong>STRETCHMODE: </strong>This\u00a0makes it so that cells stretch out horizontally, sometimes even completely mirroring the other side!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>AND...</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>CHAOSMODE:</strong> Cells still die, but they can\u00a0now duplicate in various new ways not possible in any other mode! Even placing One cell will make the simulation sprout with new patterns and formations.</li></ul>\n\n<p>But how does the simulation even work? Well, let's briefly explain that here in...</p>\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS!\r\n<p><em><strong><em>\"</em></strong><strong><em>Conway's Game of Life\"</em></strong>\u00a0is a form of\u00a0Cellular Automaton\u00a0created by mathematician John Conway. In\u00a0<strong><em>\"</em></strong><strong><em>Conway's Game of Life\"</em>,</strong> cells interact in a grid determined by certain conditions that are met. These\u00a0</em><em>conditions are the same ones in\u00a0<em><strong>Cell Theory</strong>\u00a0and they go as followed</em>:</em></p>\n<ul><li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.\r\n</li><li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\r\n</li><li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\r\n</li><li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>Programming: Tob</p>\n<p>Art: Tob</p>\n<p>Game Mode Concepts: Trace</p>\n<p>Font: Monogram by\u00a0datagoblin</p>\n<p>Music: Royalty Free Music Pack by\u00a0Tim Beek</p>\n\r\nTHANK YOU!\r\n<p>Thank you for checking out our project, we hope you have an awesome day :)</p>\n\n<p>(Quick note: Certain screenshots from the game are from early versions of the game.
