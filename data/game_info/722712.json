You have to dodge the rocks and pick them up when they land in the trees.<br/></p>\n<p>Then, you need to drop them on the platform that counter balance with the pick up truck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With enough rocks on the platform, you will be able to finally\u00a0go home.</p>\n\n<p>This game was a little challenge for me for fun.\u00a0 I wanted to make a short game but didn't have many ideas. So I ask around me for random elements. I asked 6 people.<br/>1 person, gave me 2 game mechanics</p>\n<p>- Bullet Time</p>\n<p>- Wall Jumping</p>\n<p>and each other person gave me these elements</p>\n<p>- Forest</p>\n<p>- Llama</p>\n<p>- Tapir</p>\n<p>- Hook</p>\n<p>- Couch</p>\n<p>With that, I had to find an idea for a game.
