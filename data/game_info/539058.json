Don't be hit. If you are hit multiple times, you will become a giant and sink into the deep ocean (since the orange boat cannot provide the buoyancy to support a giant). <br/><br/>To control the orange boat is very simple, just press the up, down, left, and right parts of the controller's touchpad to control the boat. After landing on an island, you can press the touchpad to move too. <br/><br/>The way to successfully get rid of pirate pursuit is to row boats as soon as possible, and at the same time avoid shells. You will also pass through three small islands. When you find and land on each small island, time will be suspended and the pirate ship will stop. At this time you can play and hunt for treasure. Every island can be visited and played, and there are mysterious treasures waiting for the tiny you. When you found and landed on the final island, you will win. This is your fairy tale continent.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44dbce90db241c3b9114f1bd3f8c5124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 480, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William at Oxford"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["William at Oxford"], "esrb_rating": null}
