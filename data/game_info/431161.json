On each level you have 10 seconds to make it to the end before the run dies and you have to try again.</p>\n<p>-All levels are complete-able however some of the levels are definitely hard.<br/><br/>list of mechanics and controls:<br/>controls:<br/>- left and right arrow keys move the character<br/>- space jumps<br/>- down arrow makes your character fall faster<br/></p>\n<p>mechanics:<br/>- jump pad: when on top of this platform you can jump higher than normal<br/>- locked door and key: pretty self explanatory, collect the key or the door wont open (things may be hidden behind the locked doors).<br/>- teleporter: The bigger teleporter will teleport you to the smaller one, use this wisely as you cant go back once you teleport.<br/>- grav change: Gravity change balls will flip you upside down, collect another one to flip back around.</p>\n<p><em>When you beat all the levels it loops back to level 1.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df72f620c906f2251b8b5bb92ce817d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["himegized"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
