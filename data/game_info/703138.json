Place your towers along the way to destroy the bugs before they get to the exit. All bugs can cause malfunction to your towers.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\u00a0- Cursor movement: arrow keys</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Select and create towers: Z</p>\n<p>- Cancel: X</p>\n<p><strong>If you had selected one type of tower and need to change to another type, press X to cancel the selection and Z to select the new tower.</strong></p>\n<p>Controllers are also supported.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>I made this game for the Game Off Game Jam: 2021\u00a0using Pico-8</p>\n<p>You can find the GitHub repository\u00a0here</p>\n<p>The game has 8 handcrafted levels, five types of enemies, and six types of towers to use to defend your place in the computing world. Initially, I was planning for 16 levels, but I had to cut them in half or I would not finish the game in time. It was my first experience with the tower defense genre. Definitely, it needs more polishing and balancing.</p>\n<p>Meet your enemies:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Beetle: the first contender to show up. Not special, but can cause some damage to your computing tasks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Slug: The slowest bug you will face. It is more toxic than any other bug in the menu.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Centipede: Its multiple legs will disable any booby traps you plant along the way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Scorpion: It is like a war tank and will try to destroy any terminals it can find.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Flies: They fly fast, nothing can slow them down.</p>\n<p>What you have in your arsenal:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Spinning\u00a0gun: spits bullets when bugs came close. The cheapest one to get.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Booby trap: When triggered, this lethal explosive takes down almost any bug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Laser: Multi aiming high energy gun. It fries bugs like no one can do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Sticky trap: Slow down enemies. Flies are not affected.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Auto turret: Do not waste\u00a0bullets! This high-tech gun fires directly through the enemies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Terminals: They fix bugs for you and give you the ability to buy your defense equipment.</p>\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n<p>RobbyDuguay for Nine Songs in Pico-8 (https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=11038).
