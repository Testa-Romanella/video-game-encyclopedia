The warm scents of sizzling takoyaki and freshly baked taiyaki wafts in the air, the lanterns bring about a comforting glow, and the world around seems to be so full of life.</p>\n<p>Technically, it is.\r\n</p>\n<p>Spirits are allowed to have their fun, too!\r\n</p>\n<p>Celestial Festival is all about lighting sparklers and having fun. The goal of the game is to simply see how many sparklers one can keep lit with the use of a golden sparkler which stays lit. If all the sparklers on a single statue fizzle out, or any four are unlit, it's game over \u2013 so light them as quick as you can!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0A project by Dream Team for VR Jam 2022, a 9 day game jam, using the theme <em>One Time Use.</em></p>\n<p>Dream Team is an Australian four-member game jam team\u00a0consisting of:\r\n</p>\n<p>Amanda Parks |\u00a0Programming &amp; Tech Art/Lighting</p>\n<p>Jane Wei | Music &amp; Sound Design\u00a0</p>\n<p>Samantha Handley | 3D\u00a0Art &amp; 2D Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harley Brown | Narrative Design, Script Writing, Voice Acting &amp; 2D Art</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fabd2385848b310e936f12ba3c74c2b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Dream Team"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
