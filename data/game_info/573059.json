This is also the first Game Jam I've ever done</p>\n<p>Warning: Do not remove the Assets folder and Make sure You have some sort of audio device plugged in... The Game Won't turn on if not.</p>\n<p>We were supposed to limit our self's to a specific console. I didn't really do this because I couldn't find a 2D old console that supported 480p or the specific color pallet I wanted to use. So I Remade Atari Space Invaders in the \"Style\" of A Snes / NES / Genesis Game. I did cheat a little by adding HD music instead of chip-tune this is my bad. I didn't allocate time very properly so I just threw together some music in Garage Band and called it a day. I used Raylib 3.5 and C to make this game.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy The Game ! - Liquid</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>XBOX Controller - Right Trigger \"Shoot\", DPAD \"Movement\"</p>\n<p>Keyboard - Arrow Keys \"Movement\", Left Click or Space \"Shoot\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd17c2c0b52db35194551a8e5fafafe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PixelPhobicGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
