With a whole laundry list of chores to complete and time running out, will he be able to stream at all? It's up to you to get him ready!<h3>ADVENTURE AWAITS</h3>Explore the Jerma manor, from the darkest depths of the basement to the casino in his living room. Every inch has been faithfully recreated in stunning 3D, then pre-rendered to a 640x480 texture and compressed to hell. Enjoy!<h3>A COLORFUL CAST OF CHARACTERS</h3>Folks, we've got em all. Mr. Green, Wall Dad, Jex, the uh... fish thing from Seaman? Can we put that in there?<h3>REFERENCES</h3>Hey remember that one bit from that Jerma stream from like three years ago? No?<h3>MINIATURE GAMES</h3>We've got a blackjack minigame, we've got the wire puzzle from the famous social deduction game with the little colorful beans. We might even have a quick time event thrown in there, but don't tell anyone. That'll be our secret.<br/><br/><strong>DISCLAIMER: This is a fan game completely unaffiliated with Jerma985 and the JERMA family of products. It was not commissioned by Jerma985 and in no way represents him. It's also totally free and I'm not making any money off it.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-29T21:12:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6da57e285e049002a1436f4b75aa2ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["14hourlunchbreak", "William Enders"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Cool Computer Zone"], "esrb_rating": null}
