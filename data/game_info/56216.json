{"id": 56216, "slug": "star-fox-adventures", "name": "Star Fox Adventures", "name_original": "Star Fox Adventures", "description": "<p>Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game, developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. Although the game&#39;s original concept was intended for the Nintendo 64, Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to re-design the game to be both a part of the Star Fox series and as a launch title for the GameCube. The game was released on September 23, 2002, and was the final Nintendo game that Rare developed, before it was acquired by Microsoft to be a part of its Xbox division the day after the game&#39;s release in North America. The game&#39;s story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and save it from destruction.<br />\nThe game received mostly positive reviews, notably on its detailed graphics, new character designs on characters including Fox, and its dynamic environments. However its Legend of Zelda-influenced gameplay received mixed feedback, while there were mixed reactions from critics and fans alike in regards to Rare&#39;s departure from Nintendo following the game&#39;s release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T12:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64e52ddbc22c3f9286fff8935c26d338.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 32, "beaten": 42, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 21, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 55, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
