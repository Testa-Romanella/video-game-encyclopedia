Side note on the medals, more than kill sprees were going to exist, but they seemed to do the job well enough.</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>InkScape</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Roland SH-201</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/1321cab038664c3635b6027da9b67ad6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scott R Howell"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
