Hire available units and place them in a special field before the beginning of the battle. You can fight in two different modes: choose a hero if you want to fight using the third-person controller and crash the enemies by yourself or watch the battle in the tactics mode. In the third-person mode, you can direct your units into the battle or order them to defend themselves. You may restart the battle and place your army differently. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMain features of the game:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u265e Use the possibility of taking part in historical battles;<br/>\r\n\u265e Command your army;<br/>\r\n\u265e Arrange your forces before the battle;<br/>\r\n\u265e Control your hero<br/>\r\n\u265e Or watch the battle in the tactics mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/056/056841c0334871c07b88d110e8ced2eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IK"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["hede"], "esrb_rating": null}
