(eew) But we all agree that sweet food is the BEST.\u00a0Or at least top 3!</p>\n<p>It is sooo delicious that even aliens got to like it! And that's okay, there's enough sugar in the world to feed us all, but they don't seem to like the concept of \"share\"... The aliens took aaaall the extra sweet donuts in the city and they are keeping them locked!</p>\n<p>I know, it's so mean...!\u00a0Someone has to teach them a lesson! And that someone is ME! ^^</p>\n<p>I'm Aiko! I live in the house that's next Julia's Bakery and I have a dog, Sussy, and three birds!</p>\n<p>When I eat those sweeeet donuts, I feel I can handle everything! (for a limited time...) So I'm gonna punch them so hard that they will regret stealing the donuts from us! At least before I run out of sugar! haha!</p>\n<p>Do you wanna help? ^^</p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> or <strong>WASD</strong> to move yourself.</li><li><strong>CTRL</strong> or <strong>left click</strong> to punch.</li><li><strong>SHIFT</strong> to cover yourself with a magic shield.</li><li><strong>ALT</strong> or <strong>right click</strong> to make an area attack.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Use <strong>F</strong> to switch to fullscreen mode.</li><li>Use <strong>R</strong> to restart the game.</li><li>Use <strong>ESC</strong> to close the game.</li></ul>\n\n<strong>The aliens can drop some items!</strong>\n\n<p>This <strong>donut</strong> will give you the power you need!</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0And You're gonna need this <strong>juice </strong>to replenish energy!</p>\n<strong>Crush them all and save the sugar!</strong>\n\n<strong>Credits!!</strong>\n<p>This game was made by:</p>\n<ul><li>Eacrow - Programmer</li><li>Flamaroth - Composer\u00a0- (Bandcamp)</li><li>Nio - Artist\u00a0- (ArtStation)</li><li>Chikorita - Artist</li></ul>\n<p>This game was originally made for the game jam\u00a0Weekly Game Jam - Week 113</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b7/2b72ab41329b9b31d061fcab057281d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eacrow"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
