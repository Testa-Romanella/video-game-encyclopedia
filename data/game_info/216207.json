{"id": 216207, "slug": "oh-mayday", "name": "Oh! Mayday!", "name_original": "Oh! Mayday!", "description": "<p><strong>Oh! Mayday!</strong> is a shoot'em up in which you have to catch all the enemies' bullets so your protective\u00a0bubble will activate and\u00a0damage your foes.\u00a0 It's payback time!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong></p>\n<p>In Oh! Mayday! your ship is capable of absorbing the enemies' bullets to fill its energy bar and damage the enemies around it.\u00a0It speed, maneuverability and shield size depends on this gauge.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Energy:</strong> Your energy fills a little every time you catch an enemy's bullet. If your energy gauge depletes, your ship will enter a stall, and will fall to the bottom of the screen. That's death.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Ships: </strong>If the enemies touch your ship, you'll explode. That's death too.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Bubble:</strong> Your shield will activate when you catch an enemy's bullet for a short period of time. Use that time to hit your enemies with your big bubble of death.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Points: </strong>Killing enemies will award you points. One of the benefits of being a high horse pacifist!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD: for movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spacebar: To start/restart the game once you have died.</p>\n<p><strong>--------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong><br/><br/></p><p>-Moving will spend your gauge faster. Save your energy!</p>\n<p>-The enemies' bullets can't hurt you. But their ships can. Avoid contact!<br/></p>\n<p>-Try to calculate your enemies's bullet and your enemies ship trajectory for better results. Math! Yay!</p>\n<p><strong>--------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Design, Art, Music Effects and \"Programming\"</p>\n\n<p>Jos\u00e9 Massa</p>\n<p>Music by:</p>\n<p>Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p><strong>\"Rollin at 5\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Rollin at 5 - electronic\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made on Construct 2.</p>\n<p>Entry for the GMTKJam2018.
