To achieve this goal, the player will first have to navigate the map and find all of the door keys to get through the level and collect the repair boxes to open up the final door. Starting at the beginning of the level, the player will be inside of its capsule.</p>\n<p>Moving close to the first collectible (key), it will give the player access to the next room. By picking up door keys and repair boxes, they will have access to the next room. The player will notice spiked turtle shell creatures which should indicate that they are a threat to the player.
