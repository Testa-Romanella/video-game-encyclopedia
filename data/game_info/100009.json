As with my previous game outing,\u00a0 <em>Dunk on Trump</em>,\u00a0I have to state up front that I'm not a game developer, therefore this game is janky as hell. Despite the jank,\u00a0 you should prepare to indulge yourself in dozens of seconds of posted up in the corner of a club type angst. Can you balance your social anxiety and intoxication and maintain at the function? I doubt you can't. Trust me, I made this and it's designed for failure.
