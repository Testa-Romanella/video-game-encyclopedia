However, he can use the ropes to come back in the fight, and even hit you back.<br/><br/>Dashing through attacks, Jabbing, Grabbing, etc.. \u00a0There are many options at your disposal in this nervous 1v1 Prototype to prevail on your opponent. We hope you enjoy the game! Feedback is Appreciated !</p>\n<p>The game was made at ISART Digital Paris by a 7 people team.</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>The game is only playable by <strong>two players</strong> in <strong>local mode</strong>, and with a controller each. You can still use Parsec to play remotely.</p>\n<p>The game is still in really early development, so you may encounter some bugs. Here are some of the known Issues :</p>\n<ul><li>Rope collision may fail\u00a0</li><li>Perfect Parrying the Perfect Comeback does not display the correct feedback</li><li>Various OOB due to grabs\u00a0</li><li><strong>HOLD START TO LEAVE TUTORIAL</strong></li><li>And many more</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Aldaberto CUELLO</li><li>Jules GUYOMARCH</li><li>Jean HARANG</li><li>Marine NICAULT</li><li>Thibaut PANCHOUT\u00a0</li><li>Corentin SAMANIEGO\u00a0</li><li>Elo\u00efse VREL</li></ul>\r\nThe FUTURE\r\n<p>Here are some of the features we are looking to add to the game/rework due to feedbacks and playtests.</p>\r\nGame System Tweaks and Balance\r\n<ul><li>Rework the perfect comeback to make it more of a comeback mechanic ( based on a meter)\u00a0and not an absolute unbeatable option.</li><li>Include a Janken-type Mind game into the perfect comeback interaction. Right now when you master the game, the perfect comeback option will always be parried due to it being un-cancelable. There is no counter to the parry and a player at 100% is DOOMED.</li><li>Nerf the parry or buff the jabs. The startups of some jabs being slow for neutral purpose, it is really easy to get an effective parry</li><li>Make the Guard a more attractive option, like buffing the on guard hit disadvantage.\u00a0May come with a complete parry rework, we'll see.</li></ul>\r\nNew Additions\r\n<ul><li>Making characters with unique traits and gameplays</li><li>Adding a special attack to the game, making characters more unique</li><li>Different Stages and Stage Selection</li><li>4 Players maybe?</li><li>If we manage to do this much it would be awesome.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:23:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b2/8b270a697de78f5e14e3dbe24fbcecd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corsam", "Thibaut Panchout"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
