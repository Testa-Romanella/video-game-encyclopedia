Making a new game means I can put my own spin on the project but stay true to the classic roots of the game.</p>\n<p>Updates will be coming out weekly, Every Tuesday at 3PM EST. So keep coming back to enjoy more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/31324c7472ae270a6a2a23c3c211a1b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Trillium Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
