The art style and gameplay will be different on release but have a similar feel and still be easy to pick up.</p>\n<p>Changes from the last demo include:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Multiple levels (two that lead back to each other)</li><li>Ability to save your progress (current level and powerup)</li><li>Control improvements and fixes</li><li>Additions to art, tweaks to audio, bug fixes</li></ul>\n<p>You can choose to walk past stairs or get on them. To get on stairs, use the up or down arrow when at the bottom or top of the stairs.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm mostly looking for feedback on gameplay mechanics, audio, and level design, but feedback on the controls, visuals, and other elements is also appreciated, as are bug reports.   Please be specific about any problem you have, whether it's a bug or not.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want to help this game look better, please contact me (preferably via comments the first time). I can pay fair prices  for art.</p>\n<p>Controls can be changed to virtually anything. Standard keyboards and Xbox-compatible controllers are supported. Button and key names may differ based on your hardware (this will be worked on in future releases).\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Default keyboard controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow keys</li><li>Attack - C</li><li>Jump - X</li><li>Climb ledge - Up arrow</li><li>Get on stairs - Up arrow/down arrow</li><li>Enter door - Up arrow</li><li>Pause - Escape</li><li>Accept setting - Enter</li><li>Back out of menu - Backspace</li><li>Guaranteed pause - Pause key (not rebindable)</li><li>Guaranteed quit - Alt-Q (not rebindable)</li><li>Debug mode - Tilde (while at the main pause menu) (not rebindable)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Default controller controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - D-pad/left analog stick</li><li>Attack - X</li><li>Jump - A</li><li>Climb ledge - B</li><li>Get on stairs - Up/down on d-pad/analog stick</li><li>Enter door - Up on d-pad</li><li>Pause - Start/Menu button</li><li>Accept setting - A</li><li>Back out of menu - B</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32c16b1471a52e2f590ddcb76b54e505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["General Vagueness"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
