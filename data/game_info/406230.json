Conquer over 35 levels with new obstacles and challenges. Compete for the fastest times or explore the environment. Experience the freedom of movement.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cTO THE TOP is still one of the most singularly fun experiences I\u2019ve ever had inside my VR headset\u201d<br/>9/10 \u2013\u00a0UploadVR</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201c9/10 Making the leap onto your must-play list \u201c</em></p>\n<p><em>-Official PlayStation Magazine</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Our core motivation for creating TO THE TOP was to create a movement mechanic that is simple to use, takes advantages of VR input, and feels very comfortable to play. We spent a year testing and tuning this system, until it felt like a movement system that was not only fun to use but also opened the door to create brand new gameplay that has not been seen in platforming games before.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Climb</strong>\u00a0- Grab with one hand at a time, to move across surfaces, up over or around. You can climb 360 around objects.</li><li><strong>Leap</strong>\u00a0- Grab on with both hands, look at where you want to go and release to leap. Perform consecutive leaps to build up speed and power.</li><li><strong>Air Control</strong>\u00a0- While leaping through the air, you can control your fall with the direction you are looking.</li><li><strong>Skate</strong>\u00a0- Green surfaces can be skated on. Grab them, point in the direction you want to go and skate across the surface.</li><li><strong>Fly</strong>\u00a0- Equipped with Jet Hands, you can fly through the sky.</li><li>And more \u2026</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Inspired by classic platforming games like the Super Mario series, we wanted to distill what made the genre so great and bring these concepts back in a brand new way. With this in mind we were able to bring a new level of skill, challenge, and discovery to VR. So you can come back again and again in the pursuit of bettering your skills and master the game.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Easy to Pick Up - </strong>Controls are easy to use and do not require many buttons or gestures. New or hardcore gamers can easily jump into TO THE TOP.</li><li><strong>Hard to Master - </strong>To earn the best times and collect all of the items. You need to master all of the movement mechanics to pounce though the levels like a robotic cheetah<strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Learn the Environment - </strong>Each level can be traversed not only horizontally but vertically as well. It is important to learn these layouts and figure out the best paths through the levels. \u00a0</li><li><strong>Challenging Obstacles - </strong>Each new level brings a new challenging obstacle to overcome ranging from Wall Runs to a giant moving robot you need to climb.</li><li><strong>Hidden Areas - </strong>Discover hidden paths in each level to earn a Medal.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>TO THE TOP is the start of something great and we wanted to make sure players had a complete package of a game with hours of content to discover</p>\n<ul><li>35 Levels to Play - Each level brings new challenges and environments to discover.</li><li>Over 30 Customizable Options to Unlock - Customize your robot ranging from hands, torso, and head.</li><li>3 Time Goals to Conquer Per Level - Each level has multiple time goals that range in difficulty.</li><li>2 Collectable Goals Per Level - Take your time and explore each level to discover Geoms to collect and a Hidden Medal.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>TO THE TOP was made in Austin, TX and we were inspired by the local music that is a part of our scene. We are fortunate to have their music on the TO THE TOP soundtrack.
