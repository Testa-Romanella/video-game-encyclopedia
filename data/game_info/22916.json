In the game&#39;s seriously warped fantasy world, you\u2019ll become the Overlord and find out for yourself whether absolute power corrupts absolutely. You could be a regular Overlord who only overlords during banking hours. However, with incredible power at your disposal and a team of evil-minded impish critters, the Minions, on hand to do your bidding, how will you resist the temptation to be wonderfully despotic?<br />\nDelve deeper into the Overlord&#39;s twisted world as Overlord: Raising Hell opens up a series of hellish new levels, each a twisted, corrupted version of the five major kingdoms: Mellow Hills, Evernight, Heaven&#39;s Peak, the Golden Halls, and the Ruborian Desert. Access to each abyss is via a portal, which opens once a kingdom has been successfully conquered and the previous ruler banished to a personal hell within. However it&#39;s not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord&#39;s newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too. Do you have what it takes to be really, really, really evil?<br />\nFind out in this fun mixture of fantasy role-playing, action, and adventure with just a little pinch of RTS!Includes both Overlord and Overlord: Raising Hell.<br />\nGet in the action and become the Overlord, the all powerful dark lord with a horde of minions to command and a land to conquer.<br />\nConquer a twisted fantasy world and show the Seven Heroes, demonic Halflings, and Rabid Unicorns who&#39;s boss.<br />\nControl a horde of slavish and loyal minions as they smash, destroy, kill and steal anything for you.
