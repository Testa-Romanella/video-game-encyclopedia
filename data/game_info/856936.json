Use perspective swapping to change between 2D and 3D modes to access all parts of the levels, collect coins, kill enemies and solve puzzles!</p>\n<p>I achieved this using a perspective swap mechanic that the player can utilise with the F key. This allows the player to swap between FPS and 2D Platformer mode and use the mechanics available to them in each mode to traverse the three differently themed levels.</p>\n<p>I developed this game in Unity as the final major project of my Masters Degree in Game Design at Falmouth University.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2f1cf88b7ede6c6ea780408c92abd80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattBaileyDesign"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
