You\u00a0have appeared on a strange land as a lumberjack and must slay the boss at the end of the path. The catch is that your damage is based on what number you roll with dice. Defeating enemies raises the minimum number that you can roll and chopping down trees, allows you to build more dice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:56:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552dbcf64cf91df4bb60f5694fd4aef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SplicerYT"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
