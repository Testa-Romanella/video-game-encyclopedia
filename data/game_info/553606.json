You traverse the map and you can pull out a metal detector that starts beeping when you are getting close to an item (beeps faster the closer you get). The metal detector has a limited battery, you lose battery charge by actively using the metal detector. You can gain battery charge by finding batteries spread around the map, when the battery runs out, the game is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T06:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7ebf0fec9632f1467a98e0ae87d094f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Minisoop"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
