This is my first prototype that I think is really good so now I'm in a dilemma. Should I continue with this game or make something else?</p>\n<p>Feel free to try out my game and letting me know what you think of it. It's quite short and has a concept that I think is pretty fun. It's a platformer with a twist. Instead of jumping through the levels you sort of flip the screen and in that way you beat the levels.</p>\n<p>If you like it, found any bugs or have any ideas for the game please let me know through the comments below.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T05:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5041bd2735559e8a1f74a7168161f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Tolo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
