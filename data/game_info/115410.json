Having that shoot button &amp; trying to look around simultaneously is simply terrible.</p>\n<p>So we had this idea: <strong>SING TO SHOOT!</strong></p>\n<p>We ran with that idea, and tailored a game around it - with team of Power Ranger-esque superheroes who fight with their beautiful operatic voices powers! The results are a bit wonky, but fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately you sitting there don't get to play it on mobile like we are doing on our iPad! :(</strong></p>\n\n<p>This was our first foray into Blender and mobile FPS controls... As well as taking microphone inputs, so it was inevitably quite wonky. The very unique challenge of the microphone also meant that there were many unforeseen bugs and difficult-to-navigate problems, but we learned tons, and will take this learning into the future with pride. Thanks #7DFPS! :D</p>\n<p>(What is Sentai? Sentai is Japanese for basically the Power Ranger type of characters!
