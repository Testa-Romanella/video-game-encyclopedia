They had devastated Australia for years after achieving consciousness however now they did the unbelievable. The whole world was suddenly and deliberately attacked. Only a breaking branch was heard when your fate was sealed by the Emus screech. The ravaging Emu Army took your home and burned your children. The only valid response is their total annihilation. The first step of this pursuit is taking an Emu fort. Kill the Emu Necromancer and free the world.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio - music (https://www.youtube.com/c/whitebataudio)</p>\n<p>Quaternius - Gun Models (https://quaternius.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T08:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c35e21e1675dee68ba39804d33f1d13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TwoBearsHighfiving"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
