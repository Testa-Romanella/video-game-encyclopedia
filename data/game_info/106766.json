Find the amulet.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Remains of El Dorado</em> is a roguelike game for PICO-8.  You're seeking <strong>The Amulet of the Sun</strong> which will bring you great fame and fortune... if you survive.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>\n<em>Remains</em> is turn based.  When you're in a tough situation don't forget to <strong>slow down</strong> and think about all of your options.  Don't die with a potion in your pocket!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PICO-8 Buttons</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe PICO-8 console has a directional pad and two face buttons.  The arrow keys on your keyboard control the directional pad.  For the face buttons, there are multiple mappings:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPersonally, I prefer to use the X and C keys.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPress C to charge a shot, press a direction while charged to shoot.  Press X to enter the potion menu.  Select a potion by pressing left and right, and press C to confirm.  Aim your throw with the direction keys, and press C to throw the potion.  Careful!  Potions will explode on contact with a wall.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Potions</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPotions are thrown around like grenades!  On impact they will affect everything standing in the square they hit plus the 8 squares surrounding it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Healing</strong> potions heal you if you're in the explosion.  Enemies are unaffected.  They also put out fires in the blast zone.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fire </strong>potions are useful for attacking groups of enemies.  They don't put out fires.  The fire ants are immune to fire potions.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ice</strong> potions are slightly harder to find than fire potions, but work on all types of enemies and put out fires.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Confounding enemies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThree types of enemies inhabit the dungeon and will defend their turf.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ants</strong> start fires in the square in front of them.  Fires spread one square per turn in a straight line.  Fire hurts, don't stand in it!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lizards</strong> will slurp you.  They are more timid than the ants and will not approach too closely.  Don't get distracted or you might get caught by surprise.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhen you enter a room with a \r\n\t<strong>cultist</strong>, they will teleport you to a random square in the room.  This will lead to some sticky situations, so try to have a potion ready!  They also teleport themselves around and stab you if you stand too close. Scary!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLearning how these enemies think is the key to finding the amulet.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7cfe70e705ff6cf6ed5b000bb1558d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Wright"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
