There are five levels (the highest being MAX) to power up your shots.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen the beam gauge is full, you can perform beam energy attacks. However, the beam gauge will decrease with each of these attacks, and once it is empty the beam energy attack cannot be used.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are two types of beam energy attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbFocused Beam: Makes a focused attack to the front while the energy shot button is pressed and held. When the beam gauge is at maximum, this will fire MAX lasers.<br/>\r\n\u30fbRelease Beam: When the beam gauge level is at MAX, pressing the energy shot button will fire an attack that damages all enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe boss of each stage also launches beam energy attacks. When the beam from your ship collides with the beam from a boss, the interference creates a huge ball of energy, which moves from the side with a higher gauge to the side with a lower gauge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c6Convenient features and option settings only available in S-Tribute<br/>\r\n\u30fbRewind<br/>\r\nRewind gameplay a by certain amount of time and resume.<br/>\r\n\u30fbQuick Save/Load<br/>\r\nSave game state at any point.<br/>\r\n\u30fbOnline Ranking<br/>\r\nSwitch to online ranking mode in settings to enter your score into the online leaderboards and check how you compare with others.<br/>\r\n\u30fbUnlimited Credits<br/>\r\nThe limit on the number of continues can be disabled, allowing for infinite continues.<br/>\r\n\u30fbStage Select<br/>\r\nThe game can be started from any stage.<br/>\r\n\u30fbScan Lines<br/>\r\nMimics the nostalgic CRT monitor display.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c6S-TRIBUTE<br/>\r\nReprints of classics produced and developed by City Connection with the Zebra Engine during the Saturn era.<br/>\r\nPlay a variety of titles with improved controls and new features.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:05:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c22e045afa518965cd55306ed6c5fc.jpg", "website": "https://city-connection.co.jp/s-tribute/taito/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CITY CONNECTION"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CITY CONNECTION"], "esrb_rating": null}
