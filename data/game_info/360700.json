Our team decided to take the approach of a Tower Defense type game, except there is only one tower. With enemies surrounding the castle from all sides, how could one tower successfully defend all fronts? Fortunately, the city has highly advanced technology that allows the tank to move! Unfortunately, the tank tower is so highly advanced, it requires a highly skilled operator like yourself to manually shoot and move. The other disadvantage the tank tower cannot move and shoot at the same, probably because the controls are in separate parts of the tower or something like that. Protect the city in this fast paced first person tower defense!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b3511fb9b4a46224e204508b5348ae1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DenverEllis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
