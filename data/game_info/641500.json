One day he gets shot by a group of mysterious people, but as the grim reaper himself fears him, G\u00fcnthers soul can't be collected, and he now roams this earth as undead. This makes the angels angry. And there are skeletons also idk, I'm kind of winging it with the lore. Anyways, can move with WASD, and attack with the arrow keys. If you die you become a ghost and can now possess people with the arrow keys. Also because you can enter the ghost state with the spacebar, and kill yourself with the R-key, because some jackass programmer forgot to remove those before uploading the game.</p><p>Banging soundtrack by Nialltunes</p><p>Soundcloud:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/niallrtunes</p><p>Pixelart by D13thgamemaker</p><p>Itch:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/d13gamemaker</p><p>Programming by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:46:40", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Repenn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
