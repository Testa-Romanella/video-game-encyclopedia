{"id": 470201, "slug": "terra-lander-ii-rockslide-rescue", "name": "Terra Lander II - Rockslide Rescue", "name_original": "Terra Lander II - Rockslide Rescue", "description": "<strong>Terra Lander II - Rockslide Resuce</strong> is a sequel to <strong>Terra Lander</strong>, a homage to the classic early days of arcade retro, but this time you will need to rescue the humanoids of the landing pads from the planet through ten levels of increasing difficulty.<br/><br/>Navigate the player to the landing pad through increasingly difficult levels within the time limit and with enough fuel. Movement or firing uses up fuel, though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached).<br/><br/>Avoid obstacles or lift them out of the way with the tractor beam. Avoid the obstacles and enemy fire while navigating the terrain. Don't land too fast...make sure it's a soft landing.<br/><br/>When all the humanoids are collected, fly high above the planet to escape, making sure you have enough fuel. Keep an eye on fuel levels and destroy fuel dumps to replenish.<br/><br/>When all levels are complete, they repeat with a slightly higher difficulty setting.<br/><br/>When a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.<br/><br/>In Terra Lander II your ship has been upgraded with a force field.  Therefore, you have a limited amount on health, but not much so be carfefull!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>Retro arcade game.</li></ul><ul><li>Vibrant Colours.</li></ul><ul><li>Loads of customisations available within the settings menu.</li></ul><ul><li>Endless replayability.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T18:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/571d6208471f27538a612e2f11d9d2b0.jpg", "website": "http://www.funboxmedia.co.uk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["DM Media"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Funbox Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
