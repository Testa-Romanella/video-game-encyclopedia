It was an exercise in starting with a simple idea for a game, and keeping it simple until completion.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe aim of the game is simply to survive as long as you can, and kill as many enemies as you can before you either get overwhelmed, or literally shoot yourself in the face. Gravity is strong on your little planet and what goes around, comes around!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI created all of the code and artwork for this game. All credit goes to Mark Sparling for the music.
