The Coven games are first-person dungeon crawlers in which the player creates a party of dolls, which can take on a variety of classes to confront enemies in a first-person combat style. We were pretty fond of both the storyline and gameplay of the original game, which broke into our top 5 best RPGs of 2018. </p>\n<p>In Labyrinth of Galleria, the player assumes the soul of the &quot;Necrolamp&quot;, an item in the possession of Madam Malta that can explore dangerous labyrinths similar to the &#39;Tractatus de Monstrum&#39; in the previous game. Malta&#39;s assistant (and the character in the key art) is Eureka, a girl who came to Galleria after looking at a recruitment poster for an exploration assistant.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-04T10:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/249/249e6661b1dc8bc518440744e2118af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 5", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Nippon Ichi Software"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
