Pulled an all nighter finishing it on time, and now it is time to sleep. Oh and I\u00a0made it on my own.<br/><br/>Also a number of things are missing, the options don't change the player name because I\u00a0couldn't fix that on time, and the mouse disappears on menus for some reason making it difficult to actually use them. Also two of the trash powerups are missing their models because I\u00a0couldn't fix them in time.\u00a0All that will be fixed once the jam is over.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Left controller stick to move</p>\n<p>Right controller stick to look around</p>\n<p>A button to jump</p>\n<p>Start to pause</p>\n<p>Game was made for 2 controllers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T07:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6ed0cd7d5c20c26d96eb7e93fe25945.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
