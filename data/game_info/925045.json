Beware that monsters can destroy the buildings of the camp. Players can also further synthesize the food by collecting the food produced by planting plants and breeding animals, and sell it for gold coins. Gold coins can be used to improve the properties of the defense tower, and higher properties of the defense tower can better defend your camp.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConversation and gifts to NPCs in the game can improve the popularity. When the popularity reaches a certain value, some NPCs can trigger additional functions. Buildings can only be placed in some areas: around the camp, around the mining machine, and in the infinite defense mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T02:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06ddebb053e22486063630c41c3ffec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4e09\u6761\u5c0f\u98de\u9c7c"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u4e09\u6761\u5c0f\u98de\u9c7c"], "esrb_rating": null}
