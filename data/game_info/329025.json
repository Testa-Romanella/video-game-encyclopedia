Like your mother before you, the road is your home and you seek work as you travel. Every town has need of your skills, but it is your right to refuse or accept the work you do.</p>\n<p>Today, you arrive at the town of Rookard, with plans to inquire about jobs and rest for a spell. The Skeleton Key's work leaves a mark where it passes, and cultivating the right impression by your words may make some work available that otherwise wouldn't be.</p>\n<p>Rookard's future is in your hands. Same as always.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> This game contains a well-telegraphed, easily skippable, lovingly described sex scene. It also has an abstract description of, again, telegraphed and avoidable gory violence. If you don't want either of these things, don't accept when offered them.</p>\n<p>Originally written by Caelyn Sandel in 2015 for the <em>Shufflecomp </em>IF jam, based on the song\u00a0<em>Skeleton Key</em> by Dessa.\u00a0Art by Kivan Bay.
