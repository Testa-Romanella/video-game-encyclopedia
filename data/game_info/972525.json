It has been improved on every front, with a story loosely following the events of the original, but rewritten from the ground up to improve the experience, and make for a much more cohesive and enjoyable story. On top of that, the mod retains its Radiohead score (now censor-friendly!), all-new spritework &amp; CGs, alongside a meticulous attention to detail &amp; sound design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T03:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/683/683f35ffbe44f761de8bf8f3ce2757b4.jpg", "website": "https://dokimods.me/mods/exit-music-redux/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
