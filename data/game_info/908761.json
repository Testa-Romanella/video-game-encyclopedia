Thats why the tools are your enemy and each round you have to try to score a higher score then them\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the game you can learn how the game works by selecting \"How to Play\" in the main menu</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I\u00b4ll stop talking and just let you enjoy the game :)</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think about it</p>\n\n\n<p><em>if you want to learn more about how I made the game and how this jam was probably my most chaotic jam yet, you can check out my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBUMzpoCu6rS_hsf32dmriA), where I\u00b4ll hopefully soon be uploading a video on it</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T13:55:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cb4eb78929606fa2dd81c76085cbc98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikzam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
