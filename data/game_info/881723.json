{"id": 881723, "slug": "space-y", "name": "Space-Y", "name_original": "Space-Y", "description": "<p>The Musky Corporation is deeply committed to the future of the human species. That's why we need to build twenty space condos on Mars to establish a permanent colony away from Earth. Don't let your lack of experience piloting a multi-billion dollar rocket filled with as many people as we could cram in dissuade you. The Edison-1 comes equipped with a state of the art AI system that can maneuver through any tricky situation. This is going to be as easy as a soup sandwich.</p>\n<p>Space-Y is a Lunar Lander type game with a few infuriating twists. Will you manage to build a viable Martian colony, or will you end up as just another debris field on the red planet? And how many people are you going to take with you?</p>\n<p>Play the browser game for free, or leave a tip to download the offline version. If there's interest I will upgrade Space-Y with additional content, a configuration menu, and even more terrible ways to die. Remember that in space no-one can hear you scream, but Mars has a thin atmosphere so they can.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T12:42:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9a0be18a8289e07f9bfb657abc1684.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["GearHead"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
