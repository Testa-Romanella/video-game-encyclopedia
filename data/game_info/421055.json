Driven by their greed, random bystanders will help you in this difficult task - any of them will gladly take the money should you can toss it to them, drawing the cops' attention.<br/>Remember, the police will open fire, so try to pass the bag to somebody else before they take you down!<br/>You can take cover behind trash cans and a hot dog stans, but mind they can only take ONE bullet before they are destroyed.</p>\n<p>Try to complete the game with a few casualties as possible.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Dank Memes\" by Tim Beek (timbeek.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fe5bb1a348e0cba74c8a304bce238a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["malmorsus", "Ermilalex", "Tiralebumbik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
