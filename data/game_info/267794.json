His owner Bobby had always placed him inside an exquisite aluminum box after using him. Though becoming smaller everyday, Keshia still enjoyed the time with Bob\u2026until one day, Bob tripped on a crossbar and dropped his aluminum box on the sidewalk. The pain was enough for Bob to forget the aluminum box and left. Keshia thus became just another forsaken rubbish on the side walk. Depressed, angered, and ERASAAAIED! Keshia picked up his companion Pencil and founded Knights Rubbish because why not? He planned to recruit other poor rubbish along his adventure.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>Wendy Floopy</strong><br/><br/>Combos Demo: https://youtu.be/9gbTAxtAjEI<br/><br/>Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, Wendy\u2019s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box.<br/><br/>One day, Keshia Erasia, the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly. Nonetheless, Wendy and Keshia were still good friends, and Wendy became a crucial member in Knights Rubbish.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>Ranawato Plato</strong><br/><br/>Combos Demo: https://youtu.be/3KVv7vBoLwU<br/><br/>Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every night\u2026until one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon. It turned out that the spoon was not only handsome, but magical. Ranawato realized that she could actually communicate with the spoon by telepathy and the spoon could do a lot of magical tricks. Together, they roamed the world, performing magic tricks and impressed some depressed souls.<br/><br/>The founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia happened to be among the audiences in one of Ranawato and the spoon\u2019s magic show. Extremely spellbound by the show, Keshia recruited Ranawato as a member of Knights Rubbish. The spoon isn\u2019t recruited because Keshia didn\u2019t like spoons, nonetheless, Keshia agreed that Ranawato carry the spoon anywhere she went.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>Othox Codox</strong><br/><br/>Combos Demo: https://youtu.be/hCQE-tASFdM<br/><br/>Othox Codox was once a magic codex written by the famous sorcerer Bobbington. Unfortunately, Bobbington was executed because homosexuality wasn\u2019t legal then. All Bobbington\u2019s precious publications were torn and ripped, some burnt in the merciless flames. Othox, though merely ripped into shreds, called for the Blessings of Rabimouchinus and gained a wheel chair to aid him. He practiced the magic written inside him as he ran away from the murderers and gradually became one of the greatest magic codex in the world. The founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia recruited Othox because Knights Rubbish lacked a mage.<br/><br/><br/> <strong>Sirurueruerue Senyesuensuesue &amp; Sugsesugsem Sosas</strong><br/><br/>Combos Demo: https://youtu.be/abvry40RbKA<br/><br/>Sirurueruerue Senyesuensuesue &amp; Sugsesugsem Sosas were once the best selling mp3 players. However, smart phones became a thing and they were thrown into the recycle bin by their owner Bobs. They joined the local gang inside the bin and became the SS brothers (even though they had no genetic ties). The gang leader Big Brother had good relationship with the founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia, so he referred the SS brothers to Keshia. After one technical interview, one behavior interview, and one on-site interview, Sirurueruerue and Sugsesugsem finally became members of Knights Rubbish. They discarded their former title \u201cSS brothers\u201d for transitional justice\u2019s sake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/011067a579bf24dd93d269b064c74676.jpg", "website": "http://shinerightstudio.com/knights-rubbish/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shine Right", "Yu Chao"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Yu Chao"], "esrb_rating": null}
