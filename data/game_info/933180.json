{"id": 933180, "slug": "pufflets", "name": "Pufflets", "name_original": "Pufflets", "description": "<p>Disclaimer - use the downloadable version for the best experience</p>\n\n<p>Pufflets is a simple evolution game where a tribe of pufflets tries to survive and grow. You can watch them evolve through natural selection and change the temperature to see them adapt!</p>\n\n<p>Information:</p>\n<p>Reproduction: Pufflets reproduce when the male tries to impress the female. The female will accept based on the males beauty stat, the higher the beauty the more chance the female will accept</p>\n<p>Genetics: Pufflets will pass down there genetics to their children. The baby will get an average of both parents beauty, grouping tendency, and fur amount stat.</p>\n<p>Mutation Chance: Mutation chance is a percentage deciding whether the baby will just get the average stats of the parents or a random amount worse or better of their parents stat. Higher mutation chance will make it so the babies will mutate more often but does not mean the mutation will be better.</p>\n<p>Temperature: Each Pufflet has its own body temperature stat. Body temperature will change based on outside temperature and fur amount. If the Pufflet has high fur amount it will take longer for the Pufflet to get cold but it will increase the rate the Pufflet gets hot. A healthy temperature for a Pufflet is 15\u00b0C if it is too far from that temperature it will start dying based on the difference of temperature.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music : Animated Adventure - Andy Eliison,\u00a0Autumn Sunset - Audionautix,\u00a0Easy Lifestyle - Lesfm</p>\n<p>Font : Motley Forces Font - nhfonts\r\n</p>\n<p>Inspired by Sebastion Lague\u2019s ant and ecosystem simulations\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80ff46fb06f0b288c217ac864511c6d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Zinkenite"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
