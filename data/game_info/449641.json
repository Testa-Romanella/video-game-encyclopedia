That's it!</p>\n<p>This is my first game using the Godot engine. I used version\u00a03.2 for this game. This is all I could accomplish in the time for the game jam, I\u00a0learned a lot and made a lot of mistakes I am not super good a programming hahaha. I\u00a0did the programming and the music and soundFX, the visual assets were free on itch.io. I\u00a0primarily write music but, am slowly learning game dev. Only 2 levels made a title screen and a win screen. Enjoy and I\u00a0look forward to playing the other submissions!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>My\u00a0Music:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/hitctrl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:56:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5858d62e4fb5a45f7026dd032ffb85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["HitCtrl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
