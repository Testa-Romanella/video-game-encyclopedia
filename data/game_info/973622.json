A dystopian world with an egomaniac leader determined to unveil the secrets of the universe. INFONET promised a utopia built on the backs of tireless androids called Denzels. It was a lie. <br/><br/><br/><br/>200 years later the planet is decaying and the mysterious Red Seed has been stolen. Raz, a renegade mechanic, searches a hidden lab and discovers the Denzel Cherry, butchered and left for dead, clinging to life by sheer will alone. Her creator\u2014and the love of her life, Doctor Shinji Fallon\u2014has been taken by a demented sicko and Cherry intends to make him\u2014and anybody or anything who gets in her way\u2014pay.<br/><br/>Fueled by love and powered by rage, join Cherry on a blood-soaked quest for revenge as she explores the massive Megastructure and eviscerates the armies of INFONET in an unforgettable over-the-top 2D platformer that breaks tropes and bones.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cookie Cutter is unabashedly irreverent, violent, and risqu\u00e9. Become Cherry, a badass android on a rage-filled and love-driven quest. To save her beloved creator she\u2019ll explore and fight her way through a unique illustrated sci-fi dystopian world as she chainsaw-murders anybody who stands in her way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Every frame of this immersive experience is drawn by hand with copious amounts of love. That means epic, fall-out-of-your-chair visuals. Grotesque bugs and menacing robots. Gargantuan bosses. Ridiculous weapons, special moves, and brutal gory finishers. All of it brought to life with benchmark 2D animation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether you\u2019re ripping the wings off overgrown mosquitos, impaling mini-bosses, crushing robots on Cherry\u2019s motorcycle, or kick-punch-uppercut-stomping waves of foes with complex combos, you won\u2019t find a better fighting experience with responsiveness and all the flair you could ask for in a Metroidvania.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Far future dystopia? Check. An android companion turned rage-filled killer? Check. Over-the-top characters and enemies? Check. Buckets of blood? Of course.
