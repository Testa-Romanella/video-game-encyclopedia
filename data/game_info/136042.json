One day, Da Stick was out running and noticed a poster for an upcoming footrace. Cool! There was an entry fee though. Da Stick turned out his pockets and found he had no money. It's up to you to help Da Stick run through dangerous levels and gather enough coins to buy his way into the footrace. Look out! Robbers, angry hard-hat workers, and other baddies are all over the place. They look dangerous, so you'd better keep clear of them; especially those bosses. Collect those coins and get to the door!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa3/fa37c3ee24d473e09265daa561f9be1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dustout Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
