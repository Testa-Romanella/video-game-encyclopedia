The player begins alone in a dark forest, with the only source of light coming from a mausoleum. Upon entering the building you stumble and fall into the depths of the catacomb, with the only way to get out by continuing to go deeper and deeper. While the narrative is not told directly, we wanted to juxtapose the feelings of being completely alone with a place full of bodies that once lived. It is meant to question human mortality and if one can continue to experience life after death, without the need of a physical form.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Destination\u00a0</em>was made as a group effort in four weeks for the first project of Core Environments Lab + Studio.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD to move\r\n</li><li>Use the mouse to look around/move the camera</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong></p>\n<p>Milena Correa: Producer, Programming, Level Design, Concept Art</p>\n<p>Changwoo Hahn: 3D Assets/Modeling, Animations, Lighting</p>\n<p>Nicky Du:\u00a0Assistant Producer, Level Design, Lighting</p>\n<p>Iann Gonzalez: Sound Design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postmortem/ Presentation:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This presentation showcases our iterative process all the way to future steps if we were to continue to project:</p>\n<p>Destination Presentation Link</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53a1fbc3d90f2f158a12addad5c01fb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["changwoo624589", "milena"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
