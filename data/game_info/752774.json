I used \"Unity\" Game Engine, \"DoTween\" tweening, Music by \"DarkFantasyStudio\", SFX from Miscellaneous and \"Special Elite\" font. I coded everything specific to the game during the game jam. I used my own developed code libraries: Debug/Trace, Playfield/ Grid Dimensions Manager, Directions Extensions, Pooling, Random Extensions, Vector2Int Extensions, Queue, Generic Game Loop.
