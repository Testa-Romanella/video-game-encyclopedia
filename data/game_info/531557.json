This system is optimized for playing sounds and triggering gameplay\u00a0<em>perfectly in sync with music</em>.\u00a0<br/><br/>In\u00a0<strong>Clockwork</strong>, you play as Jean-Paul Cloque, a clock whose battery life is rapidly dwindling. Collect (i.e. steal)\u00a0batteries from other inanimate objects throughout the house to stay alive.\u00a0As battery levels dwindle, so does the speed of the music in the background.\u00a0As you might expect, collecting batteries increases the pace of the music back to normal.<br/><br/>While this effect is relatively straight forward to conceive, in practice\u00a0<em>every single note </em>in the music is individually triggered by the Quartz subsystem. With over 500 individual audio files, every little bit of the background music\u00a0is directly synced with your battery life. From tempo changes to arpeggiators to sequencers, we've just scratched the surface of what is possible with Quartz, and we hope you enjoy our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/293/2938ca1773976c9d8335b8c9d8a70c47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["acendan"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
