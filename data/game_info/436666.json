If you'd like to play the Ludum Dare version you can do so at the link below:<br/>https://byjustasix.itch.io/ld46-dagger<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I wanted to try out the new game engine, Pixelbox, and since it was Ludum Dare this weekend I wanted to participate, but I made this decision with about six hours left on the clock and finished with two hours left on the clock. I wanted to do more, but it's 420 and\u00a0 want to get sushi.</p>\n<p>The game isn't much, but I enjoyed using Pixelbox and look forward to doing more work with it. It reminds me of PICO-8/TIC-80</p>\n<p>Anyway the name of the game is Dagger Stagger and the objective is to stay alive as long as possible while dodge the various daggers coming at you. The daggers won't\u00a0move until you do so keep that in mind.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nEnter: Start Game\r\nArrow Keys: Movement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T03:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd649b3161255d7416588927d4be125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
