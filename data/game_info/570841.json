When the user right mouse clicks, either a sphere, cube, or cylinder depending on the selection will be drawn onto the screen for 3 seconds until it is removed. The user has the option to select a sphere, cube, or cylinder and also select from the colors red, green, or blue.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>New Features:\r\n</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>1. Background Color </strong>- Users can interact with the Background Color <em><strong>dropdown </strong></em>by left clicking their preferred background color selection, with the options being yellow, cyan, and gray. The background color of the screen will be adjusted accordingly.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>2. Display Prefab in Random Locations</strong> - Users can interact with the Display People in Random Places <em><strong>checkbox </strong></em>which will spawn a \u201cperson\u201d prefab in a random location on the screen. When the checkbox is checked by left clicking, the prefab will be instantiated at a random location using Unity\u2019s <strong><em>Random Math</em></strong> Function. When the checkbox is unchecked by left clicking, the instantiated prefab will be removed from the screen. <br/></p><p><strong>3.
