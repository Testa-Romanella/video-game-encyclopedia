As a result, the gameplay is super light.</p>\n<p>You enter a mine to dig up rocks and discover gems. You can return some gems to the wizard who will increase your luck. The idea of the game is you have to find the balance point where improving your luck leads to finding better gems, but not spending too many gems on improving your luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f88b80302502d29d05f1da25f19059c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hugo Peeters"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
