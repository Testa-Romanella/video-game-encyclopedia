And is playable.</p>\n<p>A simple start to finish game no longer than 2 minutes and less than 1 minute if your fast enough. All your deaths will be shown on the map with a darker square indicating where you've previously died.</p>\n<p>The first Two levels are for experimenting with the controls and getting used to them. The controls are not shown or told to the player. Its a platformer. Figure it out.</p>\n<p>There is a timer at the top left at all times, it will not start until you move. This game was never intended to be a speed running game, but because it was so short, I thought I'd implement a timer.</p>\n\n<p>The last two levels are 100% possible and not too hard if you have the controls down.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/7334369e4aeccd5540fc61dd8ccd2186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JakolZero1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
