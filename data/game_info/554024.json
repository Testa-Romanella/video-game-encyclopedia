My main passion that I want to grow as I learn more about game development is how to tell a compelling story through the wide-open canvas that is a video game.</p>\n<p>This first little, prototype, game, thingy that I threw together in a few days, with the help of a tutorial I must admit, is my first attempt to create a fun 3D based game.</p>\n<p>The engine that I used was Unity and the programming language that it was coded in was C#.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very basic, an endless running cube dodging and jumping over obstacles, but remember that this is my first ever project in the Unity game engine.</p>\n<p>There may very well be some jank in the small sample size of levels that I made, but all suggestions on how I can improve upon it would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>In the future I hope to diversify my game portfolio and who knows, maybe make the next \"Cry of Fear\" or \"Undertale.\"\u00a0A long shot, probably, but I can dream, can't I?</p>\n<p>In any case, enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>Take care and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa48067c60e560703ba9d8acf4447eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CritAnnihilation"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
