Use WASD, the arrow keys, or ,AOE to move around. Press or hold space to fire. Kill the enemies to get more points. Dodge the incoming lasers.</p>\n<p>On mobile, you can tap and hold the screen to fire and move the ship to your finger. You can do this with the mouse on desktop, too.</p>\n<p>I decided to make a shmup-style game since there's quite a few moving parts. Enemies spawning, enemies shooting bullets, the player shooting bullets... I figured it'd be interesting to put all those into the same class. However, it turned out to be easier than I expected, which is probably more of a testament to how good of a game engine Phaser is. It took about four to five hours to complete, working on it alone.</p>\n<p>The code (files in the \"src\" folder)\u00a0is licensed under the Unlicense and the assets (files in the \"static/assets\" folder)\u00a0are all CC0 1.0\u00a0from various locations, so feel free to do whatever you want with the source!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0ccbfe7e1e7ffdaffb64eeabe1dc886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Euophrys"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
