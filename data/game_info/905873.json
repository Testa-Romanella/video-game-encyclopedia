You get a single shot to ricochet off walls and biggie enemies in hopes of destroying as many as possible. Every time your bullet hits a wall it loses integrity (i.e. health) until it explodes (which means game over). Use the spacebar to slow down the bullet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS &amp; TRICKS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The bullet will bounce off big baddies, but not decrease health.</li><li>For every 10 enemies felled a Heart appears.</li><li>The Heart gives you +5 health.</li><li>The game will GTFO your bullet if the bullet bounces 0/90/180/270 degrees too often (e.g. you shoot directly horizontal).</li><li>The big baddies have 3 health before exploding.
