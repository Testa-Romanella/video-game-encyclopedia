Its not just any maze game so pretend it's Antichamber then you should be fine. There isn't much room in 8px so here is some stuff I couldn't wedge in...</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D - Left/right</p>\n<p>W/S - Forwards or back in the plane you can't see</p>\n<p>Q/E - Rotate your plane of vision</p>\n<p>M- Mute audio (kinda buggy)</p>\n<p>Esc - Exit level</p>\n<p>R - Restart level</p>\n<p><strong>READ THIS OR YOU WILL BE VERY CONFUSED</strong></p>\n<p>The first rainbow is a menu. Press D and you will see a selection thing. When you have moved the selection to the level you want to play press W . For another 7 kinda hard levels\u00a0press E then select as normal (you have to do this every time sorry :P). The white one isn't a level, it's the exit. Oh and get to the yellow pixels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>THIS IS A HARD GAME unless you rngsus your way through and have no idea whats going on.</p>\n<p>Red is you FYI.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the terrible sound effects :P</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<strong>www.bensound.com</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sound Effects: ME</p>\n<p><strong>HINTS:</strong></p>\n<p>THERE ARE INVISIBLE SWITCHES (example on the first blue level)<br/></p>\n<p>You may need to get to 9 and 3/4.</p>\n<p>You may get into a situation where you need to restart.</p>\n<p>PM for cheat sheet\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>IF YOU GET STUCK ON THE FIRST PURPLE LEVEL:</strong></p>\n<p>The wall in the middle consists of walls that you can walk through if you press W/S into them(if you cant see them). So rotate (Q/E) then spam (W/S) to get to the exit.</p>\n<p>These walls appear in the harder levels so have a guess on where they are.</p>\n\n<p>\"Not bad\" Alex19998282</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed463754213ab70faef3e40afa23bc48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bupeldox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
