A notification will explain the context of their  use once they become available.<br/></p>\n<p>If you're into tabletop roleplaying, most of my itch entries are supplements and scenarios for Indy RPGs, mostly for the excellent FIST TTRPG.\u00a0 I'm particularly proud of The Claudia Contingency.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T14:08:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b475374449461c53fb258051066db203.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["E5Burrito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
