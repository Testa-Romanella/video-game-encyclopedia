Check the little video below !</p>\n<p>Each level starts with the layout of the maze visible. The goal is to keep your eyes focused on the marker\u00a0in the middle of the screen. After a moment (10 to 30 seconds can be enough), <strong>press down your spacebar</strong> to make the maze disappear, and let the \u00a0magic of\u00a0persistence of vision\u00a0occur !</p>\n<p><strong>/!\\</strong> Of course even after the layout disappears, <strong>you have to keep your eyes focused on the marker</strong>, otherwise you will probably not be able to \"see\" the way and\u00a0make your way to the arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro tips</strong>: When the persistence seems to fade out, try to blink.
