It appears that they too committed suicide. The inter generational double suicides, from now on known as Rethan cases, are one of the most mysterious and unexplained cases in the career of the young private investigator Sally Harrison, who has now been assigned to solve the cases. As a player, you will uncover parts of the dark past and each new clue will scare and frighten you. It's up to you to find out the truth. But will you run away or will you try everything to uncover what happened?<h3>Game mechanics</h3>In Inconsistencies you are absolutely on your own.
