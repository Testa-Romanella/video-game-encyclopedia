Be on guard for all sorts of challenges- but don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s all training- if you get knocked into the bog, just swim back and try again.</p>\n<p>There is no set \u2018end\u2019 to this game- so, you could try to get a high score, just have a good time jumping around, or take in the nighttime ambience.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\nLeft Arrow - Short, backward hop. Keeps sword in \u2018Defense\u2019 stance.\r\nRight Arrow- Large, forward hop. Puts sword into \u2018Attack\u2019 stance.\r\nSpacebar - Used in menus to select options.\r\n\u2018M\u2019 key - Cycles through mute options (All sound off, only sound effects, all sounds on)\r\n\u2018S\u2019 key - Toggles screenshake</p>\n<p><strong>You can skip to the game page down below if you\u2019re ready to play, or read a little more for helpful info and intros to the playable characters.</strong></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcd6 Hints</p>\n<ul><li>Your sword is really only good for blocking cannon shots in the training wheel- but you\u2019ll be glad you have it! When your sword is in the \u2018Defense\u2019 stance, it will passively block the projectiles. When your sword is in the \u2018Attack\u2019 stance, blocking is very tricky- you must strike the projectiles with the very tip of the sword. (Please note that \u2018Nate\u2019 cannot deflect projectiles in the \u2018Attack\u2019 stance.)</li><li>That scary red thing below the wheel punches upwards whenever a red panel lines up with it.</li><li>Never underestimate spikes.</li><li>Jumping onto the far side of the wheel will weigh it down and make it rotate faster. This is a useful strategy- but also very risky.</li></ul>\n<p>\ud83d\udc4b Introductions\u2026</p>\n<ul><li>Freddie: She is very passionate about her calling and is good at a little bit of everything when it comes to knight duties. (She actually came up with the idea for the wheel, although construction was a team effort.)</li><li>Beethoven: Smaller than most frogs, Beethoven is very quick, and can easily dodge projectiles. However, he cannot jump very high, so careful planning is needed when navigating tricky terrain. (The name is a coincidence, although he does enjoy music a lot.)</li><li>Nate: Wow. This guy is a real wild card. He has strong armor that allows him to break through spikes- but his sword is very tiny. It can\u2019t reflect projectiles with the tip like Beethoven and Freddie\u2019s swords. (Nate has been training to be a knight the longest, and has passed down much of his knowledge to the other frogs.)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7b760ff664c6b2b18f97cfb7fb7f963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HacksawUnit"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
