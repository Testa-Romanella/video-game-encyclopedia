You are in a mirror room with hurtful lasers all around you, and you have to dodge them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>the controls are very simple to remember, but hard to master. you use just your mouse, and you move it around, which flips the entire room(or just the camera if you see it\u00a0from a technical perspective) and the player(hexagon, or whatever skin you choose) moves in that direction. i didn't need to explain the controls here, but i did\u00a0it anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef7128364de5268f6089af98b012dcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mimijackz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
