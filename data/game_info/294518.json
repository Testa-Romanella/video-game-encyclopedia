He puts up a front to hide how vulnerable he is. Cracks easily under any sort of pressure. He has a dark past he'd prefer nobody look too deep into.</p>\n<p><strong>Caleb-\u00a0</strong>A devilish partygoer with a sweet tooth. Caleb uses his charm (among other sorts of supernatural manipulation) to get his way and boy, does he get it. He thrives in the chaos he creates. Nearly impossible to get rid of.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Haiki-\u00a0</strong>A stuck-up idol with a bratty personality. He's a sadist by nature but despite everything, just wants a peaceful life. You make that pretty hard for him. He's got eyes everywhere.</p>\n<p>This game is a 'murdersim' -style dating simulator. Keep in mind there are very graphic themes featured as such.\u00a0</p><p>Specific themes include: graphic violence, cannibalism, themes of drugging and assault, vomit, body horror, and religion. This game does feature any blatantly sexual content. Viewer discretion is advised.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da1e47bc7e8120c70ab890ba1d60fe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
