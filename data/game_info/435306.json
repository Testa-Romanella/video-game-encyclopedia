The WebGL build is not actively supported and has some slight issues (see below).<br/></em></p>\n<p>Changelog<br/></p>\n<ul><li>1.0: Initial release</li><li>1.1<em>: </em>Collider on sticks has been increased (hopefully fixing issues that users had with the WebGL build)</li><li>1.2: Slime sounds now decrease with increased player distance and are 3D</li></ul>\n\n<p>I did participate in Ludum Dare 45 the first time and could only work about half a day on the project. This time I got around three days of implementing an entire game from scratch.</p>\n<p>It was a cool experience and I learnt a lot in the process. I hope you enjoy playing it and I'm appreciating any comment you leave here.</p>\n\n<p>In the game you play as a protagonist that wanders lightheartedly through\u00a0 a forest as you hear a distant squeaking. It is a slime! And it is starving!</p>\n<p>You are now at a crossroads: \u00a0Do you want to help <strong>keeping it alive</strong> (the theme, tada!) or do you want to leave it there starving?</p>\n<p>You can feed the slime resources that are scattered on the forest floor. But keep an eye on its needs. When it comes to food it is rather picky.</p>\n<p><strong>A big thanks goes to Lunaventor.</strong> She provided me with the sound effects for the slime.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I mainly support a <strong>Windows build</strong> for this game. For the Mac, Linux and lazy players out there I also created a WebGL build.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The WebGL build is not actively supported. It seems to have some problems (which are not existing in the Windows \u00a0build): 1) Mouse movement seems jittery (mouse acceleration?) 2) Collision detection on resources (sticks) seems off.</p>\n<p>If you want to know exactly how badly I screw up during development you can have a look at the amazing source code and Unity project here on the GitHub project. You also need to have access to Blender and Audacity.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/2283c490a612970d6537fb5978e2a988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PythooonUser"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
