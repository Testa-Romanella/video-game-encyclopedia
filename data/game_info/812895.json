{"id": 812895, "slug": "luaman", "name": "LuaMan", "name_original": "LuaMan", "description": "<p><strong>LuaMan</strong> is a simple console based game. It is made by Maxxxel for the Lua GameJam 2022. It is made with love and passion.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to find the right word before the 'LuaMan' gets completed. You may remind this game from childhood known as 'Hangman'. To start the game simply type in 'Start' at the Main Screen. As soon as the game starts you need to type single letters to guess the word. If the letter is not part of the word, the 'LuaMan' advances. As soon as the 'LuaMan' is done you have lost the game. You can also try to guess the whole word, but if youre wrong the 'LuaMan' advances faster.</p>\n<p>You can edit the Localization.lua and Words.lua for your own custom style. Currently i havent added any hints, but the functionality is there. Just add some text to the hint value in the Words.lua.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6755818bb0b8f3931cbe5c2df7ce19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxxxel"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
