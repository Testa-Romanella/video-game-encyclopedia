The principle of 3 Cube is to move and rotate the clusters of cubes to make a solid pathway between the lit and unlit point. Once the unlit point becomes lit, the puzzle has been solved, and you can continue onto the next level by stepping on the newly lit point.\u00a0 Every single aspect of this project was created by me, from design to sound. I really do hope you all enjoy playing 3 Cube!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD-Move Character</li><li>Shift+WASD-Move Tile The Character Is On</li><li>Shift+R-Rotate The Tile The Character Is On</li><li>ESC-Close Level</li><li>Hold R-Restart Level</li><li>WASD-Navigate Through\u00a0Menu's</li><li>Shift, Enter, Left Click-To Select In Menu's</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:03:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67fd898605895244593f157270cd5be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanielVolchik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
