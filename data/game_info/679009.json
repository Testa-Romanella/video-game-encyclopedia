The angel must make their way through all the levels in order to escape from Hell. The angel can fly, but if they run out of stamina, they will temporarily lose their ability to fly. If this happens and they land into lava or a hole, they will lose a life. Alternatively, if they fly too high or into spikes, they will also lose a life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stamina will return with time or by taking power-ups. Some power-ups will be available to obtain during the levels. Otherwise, power-ups can be bought in-between levels using gems obtained during the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being wrongfully chastised, angel Azazel was condemned to Hell. However, being an angel, Azazel has one chance of escaping Hell. If Azazel\u2019s will and heart are strong enough, Azazel can escape Hell by fighting off all the demons in their path and strategically avoiding the lava and spikes of Hell. If Azazel fails to pass all levels of Hell (levels in the game), then they will be stuck in Hell for all eternity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa40b326b152c1c429f3cdd1b7c68842.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maiag"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
