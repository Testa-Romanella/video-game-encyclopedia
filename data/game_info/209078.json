Finally I succeed and can offer you my work with nearly 2 months of delay...</p>\n<p>The theme was \"<strong>throwback\"</strong>. When I think about throwback, first I think something your throw at me then I throwback at you. But I'm no English native so I didn't know about the interpretation of nostalgia. And then I thought about my early years when I was a child with my SNES and one my favourite games Donkey Kong Country.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So here it is,\u00a0 you have to throwback a baril to Donkey Kong with only a machete. Yes you are Jason Voorhees because it's in the same decade and I like the hockey mask. You can have the sprite though :\u00a0<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/jason-like-slashing-animation<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Press left and right to move. Press space to slash the baril.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1b8f3b54f06f3e304b3fce2d0b71ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kthulhu1947"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
