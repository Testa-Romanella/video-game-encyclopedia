Go from strolling at the park to breaking the sound barrier in an instant. <br/><br/>Combat is HELLA HARD and surgically precise! You do timed hits to defeat enemies, then you're rewarded with gameplay changing upgrades, such attaching bombs to your boomerang to destroy walls.<br/><br/>Every run is different, after completing a floor a rule will be a change for the rest of the run.<br/>Such as allowing fireballs to ricochet off walls or changing the behavior of enemies or bombs.<br/><br/>Player 2 can join and act as the Dungeon. He can control all enemies and bosses, and choose how the game will get harder.<br/>The game can get harder by one of two ways. An enemy will be permanently upgraded for the run, encounter or encounter a temporary harder floor.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of rogue games you are going to love Wally.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-18T11:05:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8cd4153b274a8d0f6a0a8bb9e8ee1bd.jpg", "website": "https://fantasticpredators.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 12, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BOON"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BOON"], "esrb_rating": null}
