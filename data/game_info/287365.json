There is no plot and depth of elaboration of the characters (and the characters themselves are not there), but there is an amazing feeling of flying on a flying platform with intuitive control. Probably, this is how a supervillain on a hoverboard, which at high speed, maneuvers among obstacles, should feel like it. No videos will convey this feeling and this speed. Check your reaction and flexibility, and at the same time lose a pound of fat until you pass all types of the labyrinth (there are three of them!). To tell you the truth, I could not get through the last pack of tunnels myself - there still needs some good luck.<br/>\r\nHello to everyone and good luck!<br/>\r\nThank you for your purchase:)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00f/00fb233f951e6f6c1c3d42b874bd3d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NRDSlab"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NRDSlab"], "esrb_rating": null}
