I had his permission to translate it. Even though I did not make it, I put a lot of working into completely translating this, including having to redo many picture graphics, many messages, etc.</p>\n<p>Requirements: RTP. Font patch for best gaming experience.</p>\n<p>Story: Taking place somewhere in California, the game follows Sandra Richmont, who was traveling with her parents to visit their uncle. After an argument and a bathroom stop, her parents appear to have driven off without her. Thinking that her parents plan to stay overnight in the nearest city, Dusty Creek, Sandra heads towards there. However, after meeting two others who are stranded, she realizes that they are trapped and the city has some dark secrets...</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of solving puzzles, adventure game style. If you need a walkthrough, there&#39;s one included in the game folder. However, it&#39;s in German, so you can try to babelfish it or something.</p>\n<p>WARNING: When you are poisoned in the mines, do not begin the cart pushing puzzle until you have found the antidote. Otherwise you can&#39;t get it later and can&#39;t beat the game (if you save.) I actually could have fixed this bug, but it was in the original and I wanted to leave all of the coding 100% intact.</p>\n<p>Everything has been translated, from dialogue to pictures.<br />\nThe game utilizes 99% custom graphics created by Kelven, who took the effort to make nearly everything examinable, all drawers/cabinets openable and examinable, and has pumped out probably 20 or so games. (Which all have mostly custom graphics I think.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T20:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c312ed753864ecc26aad9f188ee6ace1.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/917/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
