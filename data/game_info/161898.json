All the core gameplay features like combat and customization are implemented, but the game is sorely lacking on content, as well as a progression system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/97955dfe99e9224d55cbaaf497e6caed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tondo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
