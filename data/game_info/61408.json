With over 30 years of collective experience developing the Fable series and its community, we hope to infuse our games with the same charm, eccentricity, and humour that permeated that series.<br />\nUsing all their experiences from Lionhead, the team is working hard to make Kynseed the sort of game they\u2019d always wished had been made. To help us on this journey, we\u2019ll be calling upon the PixelCount community (that\u2019s you!) to give us feedback, guidance, and flattery. Mainly the latter, if we\u2019re being honest.<br />\nUltimately, we want to keep it real with the players and never feed them a company line. So, for better or worse, you can expect us to talk to you with the same honesty and candor as a coworker: with plenty of cursing and sarcasm.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-22T17:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ec7/ec7038248499012a9c1c0630667190bd.jpg", "website": "https://pixelcountstudios.com", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 164, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 47, "dropped": 11, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelCount Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PixelCount Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
