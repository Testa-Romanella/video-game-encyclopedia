During 2-3 hours, nice cartoon graphics and melodious music will contribute to a relaxing, but at the same time fast, gameplay. The main feature of the game is the creation of your own build for leveling up the character. You can put all in magic; poisoning or pushing and slowing an opponent down; or you can make a very fast or a lot damage-dealing hero, both for selected targets and for dealing splash damage, distributed between the opponents. In each game situation, some talents will be preferable or another. And the randomness of their dropping will guarantee the uniqueness of each attempt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf67a9088cae6f7c3694fa98d3706589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MyDreamForever"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atriagames"], "esrb_rating": null}
