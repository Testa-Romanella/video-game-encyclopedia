If they don't they will leave, breaking their room which will use resources to fix.</p><p>Build rooms to attract new workers depending on that room.<br/>-Builders build new rooms and tiles as well as repair rooms from where workers have gone.<br/>-Miners mine stone and metal to build with<br/>-Foresters will produce wood and push back the forest to allow for more farms<br/>-Farms produce food </p><p>The goal is to dig down to find a hidden artefact, upon which you will complete the game. Finding the artefact will require digging tunnels off the main stair case.</p><p>If a room which was built goes transparent, the worker has gone, this is either because you don't have any food, or because all the beds where being used.</p><p>There have been some fixes made along with a display for what buttons are.<br/></p><p>Made using:<br/>-Unity<br/>-Visual Studio<br/>-Photoshop</p><p>Made in 48 hours for Ludum dare 36<br/></p><p>Find me on twitter @Wevel50000<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/059d84d6b7be7c5189558f79b1d81e55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Wevel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
