I'm looking to get a little feedback mostly on how well the game runs on various hardware, though please feel free to give critique on the gameplay if you like. I\u00a0believe there will be some frame rate issues on older hardware, especially in full-screen mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are instructions about gameplay and controls in the enclosed Read\u00a0Me. Barnaby Buoyant is being developed in Clickteam Fusion 2.5. Please note that the game is still in early stages and things will likely still change in the final release.
