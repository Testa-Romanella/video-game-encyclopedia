Up on the sky you see the moon shattered, distant cities destroyed and a mysterious woman in an age-old outfit, biding her time on the beach as if none of it happened.</p>\n<p>As you traverse this uncanny surrounding, you start to unravel its mysteries.</p>\n<p>This is an impressionist art-game about love and loss, a tribute to our dear friend Deger Deniz. In order to piece all the puzzles, you might need to search beyond the game itself.</p>\n<p>The game lasts about 30 to 60 mins, depending on how keen you are to find all the secrets.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing.</p>\n<p>Music by Cava Grande.</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/cavagrande</p>\n<p>Follow Santima Games Facebook Page:</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/santimagames/</p>\n<p><em>\"A Fine Mess is an apocalyptic walk on the beach.\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun</p>\n\n<p>System Requirements:</p>\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 7/8/10 32/64Bit</li><li>Processor:\u00a02.4GHz CPU Dual Core</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Geforce GTX 750 / Radeon R7 260X with 1GB Memory</li><li>Storage:\u00a02 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card:\u00a0DirectX compatible sound card</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Mac OS X 10.9+</li><li>Processor:\u00a02011 or newer Intel Core i5</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Nvidia or AMD GPU with 1GB Memory</li><li>Storage:\u00a02 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes:\u00a0Dedicated graphics card required</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8246a6f04370973188b85261da5ee96c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Santima Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
