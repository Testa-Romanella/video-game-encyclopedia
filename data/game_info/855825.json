We spent a good while brainstorming and we didn't want to go with the first most obvious idea. We ended up settling on the physical sense of bouncing (dance), the idea of bouncing between situations / multitasking, and even threw in some\u00a0bouncing projectiles :)</p>\n<p><strong>Description<br/></strong>Terror at the Disco is a Rhythm Game where you hit notes that scroll on the screen, while dodging bullets at the same time. Hitting the right notes will build your ability charge meter, which when full lets you do some totally sweet dance moves that makes bullets bounce off you!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>WASD: Move<br/>JKL: Rhythm Keys<br/>Spacebar: Deflect Bullets. Requires full ability charge.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Programming: Kaiiidon<br/>Art/Music:\u00a0ScrumpyBoi (+ a some programming too)</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues<br/></strong>\u00a0 - Wasn't designed for download, so no menu.<br/>\u00a0 - There's no character limit on username which can screw up the leaderboard UI. Any user who abuses this will have their score removed &lt;3<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks For Looking At Our Game :D<br/></strong><strong>Hope You Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:45:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afd/afdb8fb988c9d348383d0a0af1d3f960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Kaiiidon", "Scrumpyboi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
