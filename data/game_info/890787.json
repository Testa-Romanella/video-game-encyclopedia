You will be rewarded for breaking bricks under different conditions and will get nothing if your results are too similar.\u00a0Those rewards can then be used to upgrade the lab so you can test more bricks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once we have provided NASA with enough unique and juicy brick data, your job is done.</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S. Keep in mind that changing the temperature can affect the bricks even if they don't freeze or melt, so go ham on that thermostat.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T10:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/212fe53685b77fa954b8d5b8c75f26a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiamHealey"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
