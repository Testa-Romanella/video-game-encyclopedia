I'm lucky it works at all</p>\n<p>Just a terrible match 3 game where you slay monsters by matching magical runes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can match either 3-in-a-row or a 2x2 square of identical tiles, or any combination of those. Each tile matched deals 1 damage to the monster. After the monster dies, a new one will take its place. When you beat the dragon, you win!</p>\n<p>I ran out of time budget for art after making the match-3 system work, so forgive the horrible 5-minute artwork and utter lack of animations and effects. Actually, just forgive the whole thing. We'll pretend it never happened.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa883ab08f6961de155eff1e57f80325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["captain_breadbeard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
