Well I have the answer to your question!</p>\n<p>Welcome to some random cube-moving-thingy game! Really exciting!!<br/>It is a really short game and can be completed in one sitting(unless you are playing lmao). It only consists of 4 levels- Easy, Medium, Hard and of course Impossible where easy is the easiest and impossible is umm yea impossible(incase you didn't knew yeah you are welcome)<br/><br/>This game was made as a personal project within a month or something. I actually left game development completely for over a year and coming back again was definitely a big decision. While working on this project I somehow felt this game would blow up(of course like bruh) and rarely would be known.. Still I\u00a0managed to keep myself motivated and make this piece of ****. It was really difficult putting things up again after a year of nothing but yeah.<br/></p>\n<p>That's all I have to say, really really sorry if you didn't like this game I totally understand it(I also don't like this game tbh) but that's the best I\u00a0could have done. Again sorry if it didn't matched your expectations but yeah I\u00a0would surely try to match it next time. Peace out and happy qubing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T08:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f721a6299126421c8ba8b6acb964680e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
