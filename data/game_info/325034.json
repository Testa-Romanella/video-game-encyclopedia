Think interactive story meets choices-that-matter; dark, atmospheric, emotional narration meets Telltale-like way of creating morally challenging dilemmas, answers to which are entirely up to the players, allowing them to reach one of a variety of possible endings.How does Coteries of New York play?<br />\nYou act as a newly-fledged vampire in New York. You have to learn what it means to be one of the Kindred in a huge, vibrant, contemporary metropolis. On your way you\u2019ll meet different NPCs \u2013 other vampires, thin-bloods, ghouls, humans... and more. You will perform tasks that will put test your humanity and take part in a complex and often brutal struggle for power between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. You\u2019ll build your Coterie and learn your undead companions\u2019 deepest secrets\u2026 or see them abandon you. You\u2019ll feast on the living and will ask yourself about the very nature of humanity and will feel the constant lure of the Beast inside you. You will make choices for the character, including which storylines to pursue and how to approach the different situations presented. You will take part in a narrative experience with branching dialogue choices, memorable characters - all among iconic locales of the Big Apple. You\u2019ll be able to use Disciplines to charm, sneak, intimidate or kill and your choices will determine your path.If it\u2019s called Vampire: The Masquerade, does that mean you have something in common with World of Darkness, Bloodlines 2, the cult tabletop RPG system, or...?<br />\nYes, exactly! Coteries of New York is set in a fully licensed universe of Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition! However, even if you know nothing about the setting, don&#39;t fret! The game is designed to meet the expectations of both Vampire: The Masquerade veterans, and new players, who never had an opportunity to delve into the World of Darkness.What about replayability and post-launch support?<br />\nYou\u2019ll be able to choose your character from three different vampires, representing three iconic Camarilla Clans (we\u2019ll unveil them at a later date).

BUT one playthrough is definitely not enough to see every piece of content we\u2019ve prepared.<br />\nAs for post-launch support, you can definitely expect new, standalone stories, enriching the lore, telling different bloody stories from the history of vampiric New York and adding new twists to interpersonal plots.Which platforms will Coteries of New York be available on?<br />\nCoteries of New York will be available on PC (Windows, MAC OS, Linux) and Nintendo Switch.
