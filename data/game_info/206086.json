It is my first time taking part, and I definitely ran out of time (see lack of audio and...well, levels). Despite being incomplete, I think this is a solid prototype that demonstrates what I\u00a0was trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Power Down is a puzzle platformer where you are a blob with the ability to shoot out a beam from your antenna that is capable of powering down objects that it touches.\u00a0Using this, you must traverse the levels and solve puzzles by triggering objects.</p>\n<p>This game was programmed in C# using the Unity Engine. Art was created in Pyxel Edit. The source code is available online at my GitHub repository. A timelapse of the game being made can be found here.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Use the A and D keys (or arrow keys) to move left and right, and use the spacebar to jump. Use the left mouse button to fire out a beam that disables objects that it touches. Note that you cannot fire your beam whilst in the air.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e71/e71d1cf94a52b45e75517a5d123c3a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lightsmasher"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
