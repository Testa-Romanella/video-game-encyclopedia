It's heavily inspired by a game called Shoplifting Boy, and served as an excuse for me to teach myself more about the Godot engine. I'll be posting more about it in my blog, for those interested:</p>\n<p>spakegames.com</p><p>The controls are:<br/>Arrow keys -- Movement<br/>Space bar -- Grab<br/>Escape key -- bring up the in-game menu</p><p>There are no audio effects other than the music, which was taken from my copy of Ghosts I-IV by Nine Inch Nails. If you like the music, and somehow haven't heard Nine Inch Nails before, I encourage you to look them up.</p>\n<p>Any questions or concerns?
