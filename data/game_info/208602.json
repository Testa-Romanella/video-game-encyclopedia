Or whether you die a gruesome death at the hands of jail dogs, barbed wiring, and basically any death or scenario I could possibly think to put into the game. If you donate, you can have a specific, of pratically any sort, put forward by yourself and I would happily insert it into the game (would save me the trouble of thinking up scenarios myself anywhose). Thanks for playing it! Hope you enjoy the short experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da1a42461aabeed9954d3a37cefe4ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarldredix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
