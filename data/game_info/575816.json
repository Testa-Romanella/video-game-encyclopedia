Contains two sub-games \"Avatar's Music Classroom\" and \"The Bread Gate part 2\".</p>\n<p>Inspired by\u00a0music instrument playing in the previous games of the series, this game is all about music and rhythm, while sharing the same story setting as my previous fan game\u00a0\"The Bread Gate\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>The interactions are mostly for keyboard, mouse needed at times. Please don't use numpads if possible, my keyboard doesn't have numpad so I cannot test that.</p>\n<p>Developed in Unity by yulotomorrow in 2021.
