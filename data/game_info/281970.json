The game is safe for all ages\r\nbut comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually\r\nhave. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A\r\nGame of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special\r\npermissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.</p><p><strong><em>* Please see the note about this WEB version at the end of the description.</em></strong> *<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\ngame involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is\r\nfar from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and\r\nNodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (\u6a4b\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308d,\r\nliterally translated to \u201cbuild bridges!\u201d), plus some features\r\nthat make it unique, engaging and relaxing.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\ngame is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required\r\nnumber of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or\r\nother lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged\r\naround freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the\r\nsame two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.</p>\n<p>\r\nAs\r\nthe nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you\r\nto determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just\r\nwatching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around\r\ncontributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.</p>\n<p>\r\nThere\r\nare no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that\r\nwill make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as\r\nyou like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle\r\nand complete it in more than one play sessions.</p>\n<p>\r\nA\r\nGame of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you\r\nwant it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any\r\nhelp and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced.\r\nHowever, help is always available if you choose to use it.</p>\n<p>\r\nThere\r\nare no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game\r\nis safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will\r\nappeal to both young and mature audiences.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\ngame can be played in English, Spanish or Simplified Chinese (\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587)\r\nand the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. </p>\n<p>\r\nFEATURES</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nEasy\r\nto learn and play but challenging</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\nRelaxed\r\nno-rush environment</p>\n<p>  \u2022 No\r\nads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases</p>\n<p>  \u2022 No\r\ninternet connection needed to play</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nDoes\r\nnot require special permissions in your device</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nSafe\r\nfor all ages</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nClean\r\nand minimalist user interface</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nOption\r\nto pause and continue later</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nOriginal\r\ngame elements like unbreakable connections, incompatible nodes and\r\nmore</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nAlmost\r\nimpossible to get stuck in a level with the help system</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nOver\r\n50 challenging levels (Note: Not all levels are available in the demo\r\nversion)</p>\n<p>  \u2022\r\nBackground\r\nselection and an option to mute sounds</p>\n<p>  \u2022 Can\r\nbe played in English, Spanish or Chinese (\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>----- WEB PLAYER ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS -----<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>To make this DEMO playable in as many web browsers and devices as possible, the following features are not available in this WEB version:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><em><strong>Animated backgrounds</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Fade in/out scene transitions</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Sounds may not play in some browsers</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Microsoft Edge does not show the mouse pointer<br/></strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Game may be broken or not play at all in some browsers</strong></em></li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>These issues and limitations only apply to this WEB version.
