I\u00a0thought it sounded fun so I made a digital version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dr_Love2-14's\u00a0Rules:</p>\n<p>My game involves a 5*5 blank square grid. The first player paints one or two squares immediately adjacent to each other (no diagonals) on the grid.<br/></p>\n<p>The opponent paints adjecently to the last square painted, painting one or two squares with the same color as his/her opponent. The initial player then takes his/her second turn, playing off of the last square painted, same rules.</p>\n<p>Snaking around, gameplay proceeds like this until one player (loser) paints the last square, leaving no room for the next player (winner) to play.</p>\n<p>To be clear, usually not all squares on the board are painted for the game to end. Gameplay sometimes ends with a player trapped in a corner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d839ae705a223c211fe7d3676107748b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lohborn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
