{"id": 850302, "slug": "ht3dr", "name": "HT3DR", "name_original": "HT3DR", "description": "<p>HT3DR is a modern remake of Hover Tank 3D, a game I created with GameMaker 6.1 in 2006. This a single-level demo/prototype of what I envision for an entirely new game, more fully realized by modern technology and my own personal advances in skill and knowledge since then.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>Action-packed gameplay.</strong> Master the tank controls to zip around the battlefield and avoid being overwhelmed by enemy forces.</li><li><strong>Graphics inspired by retro 3D games.</strong> Heavily influenced by games such as Starfox, Cyber Sled, S.T.U.N. Runner, and Virtua Racing. Modeled and baked in Blender.</li><li><strong>Music by Timothy Lamb/Trash80</strong>, whose retro beats fit the aesthetic perfectly.</li><li><strong>Sound effects built from professional libraries.</strong> In just one level,\u00a0HT3DR contains more - and better -\u00a0sound effects than the entire original game.</li><li><strong>Better storytelling</strong> through an enhanced radio system, animated character portraits, and light voicework. Under the hood, a\u00a0custom scripting system and game director guide you through the twists and turns of\u00a0each level.</li><li><strong>Physics-based collisions.</strong> A huge improvement over the original game, you can feel the heft of the tank as it glides around, and the weight of crates when you tether them.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\nW &amp; SForward/reverse thrustersA &amp; DRotate<br/>Mouse 1Weapon (blaster)Mouse 2Utility (tether)SPACEBrakesPPause gameF1Show controlsF4Toggle fullscreenESCExit game\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>The blaster's projectiles take time to travel to their targets.\u00a0Try to lead your shots when enemies are far away.</li><li>The radar shows the positions of enemies (red), explosive crates (yellow), and goals (green).

There are other options for video and sound\u00a0there as well.</li><li>This is a demo/prototype, so there might be some bugs!</li></ul>\r\nWhat's Next?\r\n<p>I started this project to see how I could improve the original Hover Tank 3D, and to challenge myself to do better with GameMaker's native 3D and shader support. I'm happy with the results, and I will probably continue to tinker with it. There's always some little thing I want to add and play around with!</p>\n<p>I have ideas for a full HT3DR game, but the time it would take to complete such a project, even with this solid foundation in place, is daunting. For now, this demo is the legacy of Hover Tank 3D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:43:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ce/6ce215b9ad10f30f854520403e607046.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Crownover"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
