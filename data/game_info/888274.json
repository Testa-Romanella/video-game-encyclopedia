Godot is the engine I chose to learn and Pigeon Pooper 2D (an original idea from my father that I've been meaning to make for years) is my first real game programmed in a real engine. Pigeon Pooper 2D was a fun project to make and the juvenile theme helped me not take it too seriously and instead focus on getting something out the door while learning Godot's basics.</p>\n<p>\"I'm a pooper, you're a pooper, wouldn't you like to be a pooper too?
