As your patrons mill about the waiting room, it's up to you to help them find their spouses-to-be and join them together in holy matrimony.

The theme is \"joined together\", which I took in a more literal sense, as the main gameplay involves marrying people.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't end up spending as much of my 48 hours on this as I thought I would, but for my first real game jam I am fairly proud of the final product, and I may even continue development in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T00:10:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26ab84c91ea1170ddf478269d04b3e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Nuz_Dev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
