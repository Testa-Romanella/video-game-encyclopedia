Either way, I\u00a0had a blast putting my skills to the test! I hope you enjoy my game!<br/></p>\n<p>The theme is\u00a0<strong>Rewind</strong>, thus, I\u00a0present to you my game, <em><strong>Rewind Race</strong></em>! It is a game in which you must complete the level before time has run out, but after completing the level, you must race a \"rewind\" version of your completion,\u00a0<strong>AND WIN!</strong> It will take a bit of brain power to find the best path for your success, there and back. <br/><strong>If you get stuck, try different paths or try collecting different items on your route.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I will be making a video on Rewind Race's development process here in the next week. Be sure to check out my\u00a0YouTube Channel to see it when it goes live!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c4950ddc74bda3a897656fdd923f30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Woots"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
