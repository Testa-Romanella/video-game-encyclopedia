Solve triptychs of sliding block puzzles to reveal unsung histories. At the peak, rejoin your strange kin.</p>\r\nII.\r\n<p>This free demo contains a single triptych in a seaside biome. It is intended as a small vertical slice of a more complete experience. <br/><br/>If you enjoy it, please let me know! If you don't, please let me know (gently)! Yr feedback will help me decide how to grow things from here.<br/></p>\r\nIII.\r\n<p>NOTE: If you're not familiar with slider puzzles, you can read about how they work and one strategy for solving them. Personally, I like just pushing stuff around and seeing what sticks. For ease of access, STONEPUSHER also allows you to bypass puzzles, leaving a much shorter but hopefully still evocative story.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e821fc0480d21ab11ea6cfdeb33606d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["-hexcavator-"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
