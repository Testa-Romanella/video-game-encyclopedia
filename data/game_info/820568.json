Its a wave survival game with differrent maps and enemys. sadly towards the end the levels broke so we had to package it when it mostly doesn't work. the textures for all the assets also didn't work so the properties for the matirials are in seperate voxel files. There are ment to be 4 levels that are randomly picked with a roll of a 4 sided dice. Water, Fire, Space, Arena. each has 3 of the 6 types of enemys with each enemys style being custom to the level. There should be differrent waves and a health bar.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"Rolling worlds\" is the actual game file. the others are voxel files if you want to see the other assets with matirials.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/493a01adb62b1701d85a51da2f92857e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tom_llong"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
