Now the base also sends enemies at us! Send your Ninja Runners, Karens, Kyles, and even more characters to the other base to beat it and gain new characters as you progress through the levels! This game is still very early in its development and needs more polishing but we wanted to share it to see how you guys like it and to gain feedback! Thanks for giving it a shot! *We are working on a fix for the money feature since it slowed down a lot when we published to WebGL*.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>-Use the 6 (unlockable) buttons to send a special character to the enemy team.</p>\n<p>-Press the \"+$500\" button to make your earnings rate increase (note this will make the cost of the same button go up after every click).</p>\n<p>-Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T04:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6547c599dbf51e2b3de8e700073851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpicyCatStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
