I've currently only got a PC build up, but please let me know if you'd like to play and would require a mac build. I can see what I can do!</p>\n<p>PSS! theres a discord for the old webcomic thats still a little active, if youd like to talk about the vn with some folks. : )\u00a0https://discord.gg/WMzKQQ2T27<br/></p><p>PSSSSSSSSSSS. here's the soundtrack. https://curryswirl.bandcamp.com/album/space-hop-ost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979304a9f263e0161bd671aa30538ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["curryswirl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
