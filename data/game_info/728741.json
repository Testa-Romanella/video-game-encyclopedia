You play as a mutated humanoid bean eliminating other\u00a0mutated humanoid beans and shoot weapons that use beans as bullets. This game will eventually become multiplayer but it's no where close getting to that point yet. Myself (Mayan) and my friend (ShxShlix) just work on this game when we're bored. My friend mostly does the modeling things since I haven't had the time to do so. I mostly do everything else.
