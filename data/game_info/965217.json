Hyperspace opened the door to the stars, but habitable worlds are few and far in between, overpopulation is still rampant, and our civilization's appetite for resources has only increased. For over a hundred years, the incredibly rich Dust Zone sated this endless appetite, jointly controlled by the United Earth Nations and the Zone Mining Cooperative. But humanity\u2019s fighting chance only lasted for a short hundred years.<br/><br/>Now, it has gone dark. Freighters stopped arriving with supply hauls and humanity is facing an unprecedented crisis. It's up to the commander of UEN's finest fleet, to deploy into the Dust Zone, investigate, and solve the supply chain crisis before it spirals out of control. It's time to demonstrate strategic aptitude in a turn-based management mode.
