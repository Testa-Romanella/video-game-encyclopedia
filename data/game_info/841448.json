The museum showcases multimedia artwork from people who identify as having a disability.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Informed by both poststructuralist approaches to disability representation and the social model of disability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our intention was to create an accessible interactive game that presents artwork from artists with disabilities. We wanted players to be exposed to the creativity of artists with disabilities, with the choice of how they experience the space. Players have the option to engage their visual or auditory senses at different levels. We did this to make this interactive experience accessible to individuals with sensory sensitivities. This isn\u2019t a museum solely for people with disabilities, it\u2019s an interactive and accessible museum for all people interested in art. Through utilising poststructuralist theory in relation to disability representation, our intention was to challenge the disability binary of able and neurotypical and non-able neurodivergent in relation to representation in art and creative media as well as challenge the binary in relation to accessibility of art.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Utilised research about the representation of disability in media and games, accessibility issues with games and art, aesthetics of museums and autism centres, and the creative works of artists with disabilities - typically excluded from mainstream media,\u00a0 museums and showcase spaces.</p>\r\nThis experience will remain a project purely for academic purposes at this stage\r\nTime Spent on the project: 3 weeks\r\nCreators:\r\nMatthew Johnson(Film Student)\u00a0- Aesthetics researcher\u00a0\r\n\r\nJessica Sherlock(Film Student) - Artist researcher\u00a0\r\n\r\nMartyn Evans(Games Student)\u00a0- Game programmer\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Rachel Stiller(Games Student)\u00a0 - Game designer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T10:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb23501b8f8bc8c3aeadf17b0df4ed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martyn", "RaeRay3"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
