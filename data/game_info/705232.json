The game has been developed for PC play.</p>\n<p>Wairua is home to the spirits, a vast range of immortal, supernatural entities that often embody different aspects of life and nature. In certain places, the landscape of Wairua seems to conform closely to areas of the human physical world, to the extent that a human might not immediately notice the difference. In other places, the geography of Wairua has no relation to the physical world, and the two settings vary considerably. Unlike the Human World, most of the Wairua's occupants usually go about their activities at night rather than during the day.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Use:\u00a0AWSD to move</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f44b0ed7e5b07ad7bc63325f0a8d36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aoife_0302"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
