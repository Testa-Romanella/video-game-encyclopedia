Levels are generated in the form of a string. Using this string, you can also share your created levels with friends and strangers alike to show off your level design skills.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA Level for Double Crossroads needs to mention -\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>The position of the two assassins</li>\n<li>The orientation (i.e. the direction in which they are looking) of the assassins</li>\n<li>The location of Wall</li>\n<li>The location of Holes and tiles</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tYou can create a level by indicating the positions of the relevant items on a grid. Follow this guide to find out how to create the grid using characters.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe first thing you need to do is to create the map on a grid/graph paper. You can use whatever notation you feel comfortable with, but I have used a shaded square to indicate hole and circles with arrows to indicate the location of the assassins and the direction they are facing. For this level, I won't be putting in any walls. However, if you choose to, you can indicate a wall by putting a 'W' sign in a square.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnce you have created a level, it's time to get the coordinates. Starting from zero, number the rows and columns of the map.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLet us take the third screenshot as an example (the one that looks like a square donut).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNow, about the map, we know -\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe Length and Breadth of the map are 3 each\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe position of the first assassin is (0,0) (This number is derived from the numbering of the rows and columns we just did in the above illustration)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe position of the second assassin is (2,2)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere is a hole at (1,1)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMaps in Double Crossroads are coded using numbers. The numbers are represented by -\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Values       </strong><strong>Characters</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t0-9                   0-9\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t10-35               A-Z\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t36-62               a-z\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA level is described using the above code numbers in the following way -\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t[FIRST CHARACTER][DIMENSIONS]{ASSASSIN 1 POSITION][ASSASSIN 2 POSITION][Optional:WALLS' COORDINATES][Optional: ASSASSIN 1 OR 2 POSITION, depending on choice][Optional: Positions of Holes/Tiles]\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tKeep in mind, the coordinate system of the maps is zero-indexed, i.e. the first tile can be thought to occupy coordinates 0,0 .\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe First character indicates which way the two assassins are looking. Its numerical value can be derived by adding the two values\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor Assassin 1, the values are 0 for looking at zero degree, 1 for looking at 90 degree, 2 for looking at 180 degree, 3 for looking at 270 degree.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor Assassin 2, the values are 0 for looking at zero degree, 4 for looking at 90 degree, 8 for looking at 180 degree, 12 for looking at 270 degree.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tKeep in mind, there has to be a difference of 180 degrees between the two assassins, if you want to have a long distance duel. However, if both assassins will meet on the same tile (which is also a possible solution), then this need not be the case.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>DIMENSION -</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next two characters are used to describe the total length and breadth of the level. Thus, for a map whose total grid length is 10 and breadth is 8, it can be mentioned as A8 (as A is code for 10).\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>ASSASSIN 1 POSITION -</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next set of two coordinates are the position of the first assassin. Keep in mind, these are zero indexed. As such, it can be 00. The floor below the assassins is always assumed to be a valid, empty tile with no walls or holes in it.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>ASSASSIN 2 POSITION -</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next set of two coordinates are the position of the second assassin. As in the previous case, these are zero indexed. As such, it can be 00. The floor below the assassins is always assumed to be a valid, empty tile with no walls or holes in it.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>WALLS' COORDINATES -</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThese are the coordinates of the walls. A map may not have walls - in that case proceed to have holes or tiles if need be. List muliple coordinates of walls here if need be. For example, let us say you have two walls in the map at (1,1) and (1,2). This part will read as 1112.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>ASSASSIN 1 OR 2 POSITION -</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is an optional part - and is used as a switch to indicate the presence of floor tiles or holes. Let us say you want to place holes in the map. Now, if a map has more holes than floor tiles, it makes sense to just mention the floor tiles, as this will keep the string short.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMention the coordinates of the first Assassin to switch to floor mode (i.e. whatever you type next are floor tiles).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMention the coordinates of the second Assassin to switch to hole mode(i.e. whatever you type next are holes).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPositions of Holes/Tiles -\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDepending whether you mentioned the first or the second coordinates of assassins, these will be the position of holes or tiles.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHence, we arrive at the string for the map mentioned in the screenshot.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe string for this map is -\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tD3300222211\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHere, the first character D indicates the Assassin 1 is at an angle 0 degree and the other assassin is at an angle 180 degree (0+12).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe following two characters (3 and 3) indicate that this is a grid of length 3 and breadth 3.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next two characters (00) indicate the position of the first assassin.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next two characters (22) indicate the position of the second assassin.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSince there are no walls, we can ignore the part of the string used for walls.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next two characters (22) change the mode to hole mode.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe next two characters mention the location of the only hole on the map.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tExample 2-\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLet us take the last screnshot as an example.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs we can see, the level above has -\r\n</p><ol>\n<li>Two assassins, one at zero degree, the other at 180 degree (hence first character is D). Their locations are 0,2 and 5,2 respectively.</li>\n<li>a 6x6 grid</li>\n<li>One wall on position 3,2</li>\n<li>Multiple holes at mentioned locations, with certain changes made to facilitate solution</li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tThe string for the above level is .\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tD6602523252000103040540515354555\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dac75b23db3e52d41ee87cdc1b7e64c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kullu"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
