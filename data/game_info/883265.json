Don't expect to do this in a few hours, even with autoclicking-cheat it took my friend approx 2 hours to get to level 50 and it clicked like 15 times per second. The game is designed to take a long time to finish and for a normal player to play maybe 10 minutes per session.</strong></em><br/><br/>As any idle game <strong>IdleTree</strong> also contain something called \"Ascension\".\u00a0<br/>Ascension is where you spend your hard-earned DNA points to get <strong>permanent\u00a0</strong>upgrades that will make mechanics in the game stronger. These will never reset when accepting the <strong>terms of ascension.\u00a0<br/><br/>Each Ascension will ...<br/>... Reset the following:<br/># Player level<br/># Water<br/># Upgrades that require water<br/><br/>... NOT reset the following:<br/># Unspent DNA points.<br/>#\u00a0Upgrades that require DNA<br/># Level records<br/># Objective progression<br/><br/></strong>You will unlock the ability to ascend at level 10!<br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>XP formula:<br/>Seed stages: <strong>25 x Level<br/></strong>Tree stages: 200 x Level x Level x Level<br/>Fret not! With all available upgrades it will go quite fast even with the amount of XP needed per level. (First run to level 10 is always the slowest, so be patient and try to get there at least once!)\u00a0<br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Assets I've used in this project:<br/>https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters<br/>https://mamanezakon.itch.io/forest-tileset\u00a0- I used the tree you find here as a guide to paint more versions of the tree as well.
