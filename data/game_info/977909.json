{"id": 977909, "slug": "dot-hop-2", "name": "Dot Hop", "name_original": "Dot Hop", "description": "Dot Hop is a grid-based puzzle game. Find a path from start to end without leaving any dots behind. You can't move backwards, but you can hop over dots you've already dotted. Some of these can get pretty tricky, but the knots are pretty satisfying to unravel.<br/><br/>Dot Hop has 72 puzzles and over 1000 dots to be hopped. I'm planning to add more puzzles and themes over time, pretty much indefinitely - I love exploring this puzzle pattern and trying to come up with harder shapes. The puzzles are created by hand for now, but a generator is in the works.<br/><br/>Dot Hop's origin story is covered in this short youtube devlog: https://youtu.be/yfdHTPWyWvA<br/><br/>You can also find the source on github: https://github.com/russmatney/dothop", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T06:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee6f5ec86f18737587f84bb401c723f.jpg", "website": "https://russmatney.com/note/dot_hop_game.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Russell Matney"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Russell Matney"], "esrb_rating": null}
