You can summon weapons and cast spells to fight your way through an army of metal-wielding warriors and corrupted rock-mages. Take back the stronghold of a stone monstrosity who aims to control the underground and force them to do his bidding!</p>\n<p>This is my first game using unreal engine, and it was a lot of fun!
