But what's this?! The water buckets are already hogging it all... well, better stop them before they take it!</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game has been sitting in my projects folder for quite some time now! I think it's been 5 months? Well, it's taken this long because I'd left it at a point where it was completely finished, but missed some final touches to make it publish-<em>worthy!</em>\u00a0Let's say I was a tad lazy! :D</p>\n<p>But she's here now! Furnace-Chan is up and ready to burn! I hope you'll enjoy her short little adventure.</p>\n\n<p><em>Music and SFX belong to Nintendo / HAL Laboratory<br/></em><em>Font is called \"Cute Font\" by Paula Tennet.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0d3950cc4628c1d347a4d87b618844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xXFAIRLY GAMES EPIC_2007xX"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
