Only includes an intro and some menus. Uploading because I'm proud of the assets I created in the time limit. I have some design documentation for the battle system and overworld written down and may continue to develop the idea.</p><p>All assets except the one font I listed below were created by me.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;!&gt; NOTE &lt;!&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There is no gameplay. The battle menus are not enabled. Just enjoy the (limited) sights and sounds.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, GBJAM should either change to allow a month of development time, or at least make a future jam that allows for more time. 9 days is not much time if you work a full time job and have other life responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dev Tools Used:</strong></p>\n<p>Game Maker Studio 2 (a departure from me using LibGDX and Java)</p>\n<p>https://www.gimp.org/\u00a0for Pixel Art.
