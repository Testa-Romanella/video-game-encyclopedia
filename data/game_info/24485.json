They make sounds when you \n      touch them. Move them around and stir them up.<br/>Resembling \n      delicate snow crystals, Marine-Crystal plankton elegantly float on the \n      surface of the water. The plankton get their name from their distinctive \n      snowflake shape. They grow in clusters of 35 and line up in very orderly \n      formations. When stimulated, Marine-Crystal plankton spin and produce \n      vibrant sounds. While the plankton do grow in size if they are \n      repeatedly tapped, they gradually return to their original size over \n      time. They are born in four polygonal shapes: triangle, square, \n      pentagon, and hexagon. The ends of the crystalline protrusions also take \n      on the same shapes. The tone of the sound they make changes depending on \n      the shape of the Marine-Crystal plankton\u2019s body.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6c776ae75e01dad229a667305f5db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
