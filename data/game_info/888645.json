Every avian creature simply plucked from existence, that is except for one.</p>\n<p>Toto, the dodo bird, entrepreneur and last surviving member of the feathery race. One casual morning on her opening her caf\u00e9, where she serves various drinks, she finds a parcel outside her door. Inside, an amber egg, a feather and a book of recipes.<br/></p>\n<p>She quickly learns that this is no ordinary egg, and after accidentally spilling a drink made from the recipes onto the egg and the feather, something miraculous happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a shine, a shimmer and finally, a bird appears. Toto and her new friend, Pigeon, must collect feathers to revive the birds, all while trying to keep her caf\u00e9 afloat.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programmer, Game Idea, Artist: crazybugdevelopments</p>\n<p>Writer, Game Idea &amp;\u00a0Story:\u00a0tetsudanger</p>\n<p>Second Programmer: Eruvande</p>\n<p>Sound effects from\u00a0Bensound.com and freesound.org</p>\n<p>Music from richarrest from Itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf60f4a0cfa6db2ab8bef4c2de3c0bf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["crazybugdevelopments", "tetsudanger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
