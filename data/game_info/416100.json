You must convince people of love without your magical arrows.</p>\n<p>Help the people of Ancient Greece fall and stay in love by completing various quests for them.</p>\n<p>There are a few quests to complete around the 3 towns. Currently the bread making quest is unfinished and doesn't work that well\u00a0(uncompletable). Zoe's\u00a0quest\u00a0is a little\u00a0iffy\u00a0too.\u00a0You\u00a0have to talk\u00a0to\u00a0her\u00a0multiple\u00a0times after\u00a0completing the quest\u00a0to get the\u00a0correct\u00a0dialogue but\u00a0otherwise\u00a0it\u00a0works\u00a0fine.</p>\n<p>I quite enjoyed making this little game though there are definite quest structure improvements to make if I were to turn this into a full game.
