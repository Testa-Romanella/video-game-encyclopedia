It is one of the few games to use the Hold-And-Modify display mode of the Amiga for in-game graphics, a mode which allows thousands of colors to be displayed at once, but in a format that's better suited to static images than moving objects. It may have been the first commercial game to use Hold-And-Modify. Pioneer Plague was not ported to other systems.</p>\n<p>Williams also wrote the 1986 Amiga game Mind Walker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fda/fdac1f2ab5180295d6e2872bf22aa1cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Mandarin Software", "Terrific Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
