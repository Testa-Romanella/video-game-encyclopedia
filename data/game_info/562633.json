The theme was \"stronger together\" and I made it so when you have more magnets they are stronger and have more reach than if you would have only one.</p>\n<p>Be aware that this is my first ever game and there might be some bugs. If you have things outside of your screen view, just press fullscreen and it might work.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you like it :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2db69ca2dec799c1ec25dfc3b892e2f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EhhHejsan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
