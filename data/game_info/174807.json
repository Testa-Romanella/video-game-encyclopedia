The goal of the game is to bring about the fiery inception of a star in the void of space.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Conciliator for creating an awesome soundtrack for this game! <br/></p>\n<p>Click here to view their soundcloud page.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Use your mouse to move a point of gravity around in space, click the mouse button to activate a gravitational field, pulling objects towards your cursor.</p>\n<p>The asteroid in the center of the screen is the start of a star. It has it's own gravity which will increase as it grows.</p>\n<p>Using the gravity from your mouse, smash together asteroids to create smaller meteoroids which can be easily absorbed to grow your planet. At the beginning, a hit from an asteroid can destroy your budding planet, but once you are larger you can gain mass from them.</p>\n<p>Watch out for giant planetoids, if you get hit they will end the game at any stage.</p>\n<p>The game uses a realistic model of gravity, so see if you can get an asteroid to orbit your planet!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move and click mouse to use gravity</p>\n<p>F to toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p>R to restart (after your planet blows up you will need to restart)</p>\n<p>Q to quit (or click the x if you aren't in fullscreen)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4e7423d1928a1da3ad542c015fc2eeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aeolus1364"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
