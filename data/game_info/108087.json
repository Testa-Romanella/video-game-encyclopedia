Both sides were equally matched in weaponry and might. That's when the alchemists arrived. With their dark magic, they created terrible beasts that quickly became uncontrollable.

Those who wanted to survive, fled to isolated areas.<br/><br/><strong>Story<br/><br/></strong>Vincent lives alone with his Uncle, Troy,\u00a0 in an isolated cabin at the base of a mountain. His parents left when he was just four years old to secure another cabin on the other side of the mountain, but they never returned.
