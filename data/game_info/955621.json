That's right, our game is all about towers and playing together. It\u2019s not only because of fun when it is two of you, but also because each player has a unique card set. So only teamwork lets you stand against the hordes of goblins, trolls and other hideous creatures. The Book of Knowledge calls for your protection from oncoming armies of enemies! Be prepared for anything, terrible goblins and trolls only waiting for your mistake. And of course who would resist throwing some dynamite at them for their dirty deals!<h3>Basics</h3>Our co-op multiplayer game is based on the classic tower defense mechanics combined with a card system. Your team has to protect the Book of Knowledge from the invasion of evil creatures coming wave after wave. How? Build towers, place traps, cast spells or greet your enemies with a hail of arrows. Your actions depend on your and your friends\u2019 cards. Create strategies, experiment and adapt!<h3>Multiplayer</h3>At the beginning of the game you connect to friend's lobby or starting game solo from your own lobby. Maximum players amount per each lobby is four. If you playing with a friend (maybe even with a several ones), try to plan your next moves together to overcome your opponents. Sometimes lack of communication and joint strategy can lead to lost game.<h3>Autochess</h3>In this game, you get to earn gold each turn, which you can then use to buy cards from the shop. At first, you'll only have access to weaker cards like \"crossbow\" or \"lightbulb\". But don't worry, as you progress through the game, you'll have the chance to upgrade your shop and acquire more powerful cards. Just keep in mind that this may require additional investments of gold.<br/><br/>Remember, your choices on how to spend your resources can have a big impact on your success in the game. So, choose wisely and have fun playing!<h3>Cards</h3>Any game action requires playing a card. Each player starts with one card in his hand at the very start of the game. Different types of cards allow to perform different actions. For instance: place building, cast aoe spell against enemies or summon huge snowstorm on the whole map. If you run out of cards, you can buy them in the shop with money, earned after every succesfully repelled enemy wave, or for selling buildings on the map. Thus, \"recycling\" weak buildings is a very lucrative business.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Co-op gameplay.<br/></li><li> Various cards and game mechanics.<br/></li><li> New look at tower defense genre.<br/></li><li> Auto-chess like game loop and economy.<br/></li><li> Easy to start playing with friends.<br/></li><li> Replayability.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T06:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d4b6021ea1f3b6a887513430b98c409.jpg", "website": "https://towerstogether.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Vagabond.studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vagabond.studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
