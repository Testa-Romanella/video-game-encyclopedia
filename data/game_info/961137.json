There are only four levels to complete but each one will have more fiendish traps to beat or puzzles to complete all while attempting to beat the clock.  Control your all terrain drone orb and collect gold coins while navigating this tomb to gain your freedom.<br/><br/><strong>[Difficulty]</strong><br/>Game difficulty will be measured by how many lives you start the game with and how many collectible coins you will need for an extra life.  It will also affect how much time you will have to complete each level and how much time is added as you move to each level.  Can you complete the game on 'Extreme'????", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-22T03:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed687496e80b4cdcce61342efb6efb95.jpg", "website": "http://purpleoctopusgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purple Octopus Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Purple Octopus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
