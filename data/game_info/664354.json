Its time for the sixth annual Hyper Drone Racing Tournament. Lets make some noise for our contestants today, who are coached by the amazing team behind Auran Star, last years winner.</p>\n<p>For those new here, the rules are simple:</p>\n<p>Contestants enter the back of our dedicated racer van and control their drones into the local airspace</p>\n<p>Using a specialised battery power sourced from our sponsor; the Aurian Army, they must traverse their way down the road. Don't worry about signal distances, as the van will make sure to keep within a safe distance to your drone.</p>\n<p>Special Holographic Checkpoints must be passed through to gain more score and additional boost to keep you in the field. Crash into anything within the road and you'll end your run, where our voting panel will determine a final score for the performance.</p>\n<p>Looks like the first contestant is about to start. Are you ready.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>\n<p>Pilot the drone around the designated area, keeping an eye on the drone's battery level shown on the back of the drone.</p>\n<p>Pass through the checkpoints to gain points, but ultimately you'll want to do so for the additional battery charge, which will help you go further.</p>\n<p>Avoid crashing into obstacles littered around the road. Some obstacles require you to go under or over them so watch out. (Tip: Keep moving to avoid one of the obstacles.)</p>\n<p>Don't go too far out of the area. A barrier will show when you are getting close to the edges. You can pass the barrier, but the screen will redden until you go too far.</p>\n<p>The game will end either when the drone reaches a battery level of 0, you crash into one of the obstacles littered around the road, or you stray too far behind the red barriers around the edges of the road.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>CONTROLS | KEYBOARD</p>\n<p>*recommended to head into settings and use a sensitivity of 0.7 for optimal results.</p>\n<p>W: Move the drone upwards.</p>\n<p>S: Move the drone downwards.</p>\n<p>A: Move the drone left.</p>\n<p>D: Move the drone right.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>CONTROLS | CONTROLLER</p>\n<p>*recommended to head into settings and use a sensitivity of 0.5 for optimal results.</p>\n<p>Left Analog Stick: Movement</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>GROUP</p>\n<p>David Mallett (Dav1959):</p>\n<p>3D Modelling: Obstacles, Drone, Floor, Van.</p>\n<p>Level Design: Building chunks, Clouds, outside environment.
