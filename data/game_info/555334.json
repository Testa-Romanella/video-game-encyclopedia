Try fiddling with the num lock if it doesn't work.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>RussiaVPoland, the second file (in the zip) is made in gamemaker studio 2, and is much newer and is also unfinished. It uses f and g (and 1 and 2) to scroll through selections and J and 3 to place. It's less polished, and probably will never be finished.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/78347d22641ec261b5939961375b8236.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boozle812"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
