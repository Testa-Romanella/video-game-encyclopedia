We did not use a pre existing engine for this game. \u00a0In that sense, the jam was very helpful in detecting our engine flaws and ergonomics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We did not finish all the way, but if you decide to test it out and jump around, please let us know if the engine crashes in unusual ways or not ;).</p>\n<p>Our intention was to make a game where you (the player) are a dice and get attacked by slimes. You have to land on a side and the side pointing up is the amount of damage you deal. The core idea is in, it just feels and looks a bit iffy ;) landing on a side is hard and doesnt feel right yet, but hey, we had fun!</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>G: Increase gravity (resets when you jump)</li><li>Space: Jump forwards (towards camera direction)</li><li>WASD: move camera</li><li>Arrow keys: Spin around!
