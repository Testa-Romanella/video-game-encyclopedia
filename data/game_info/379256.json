{"id": 379256, "slug": "one-long-night-austinj23", "name": "One Long Night (Austinj23)", "name_original": "One Long Night (Austinj23)", "description": "<p>This game was inspired by the Arkham video games as well as the new Spider-Man video game. I liked the idea of having multiple choices. The character I made was based on Batman, since he is my favorite hero. He wants to live a normal life honestly, but he knows that he needs to save the city because he's the only one who actually can. When it came to making the choices throughout the game, I didn't want a hero who wouldn't just leave people to die, but I know that he struggles with that choice because he doesn't always want to save the city, so each branches that I created deals with these types of choices. The way that I made this story make sense was having a single enemy bring in others to threaten the city and link everything back together. I wanted the villain to be as creative as possible and create many disadvantages for my hero as possible. So, when it came to creating the decisions, I was able to make several choices that go along with the story based on the villains motives and desires. The most difficult aspect of this game was finding ways to link the villains motives to the other characters in the story. I had a difficult time linking them back to this specific villain and creating multiple outcomes within these decisions. The way I actually made these actions align with what the readers interests and character's motivations was with the desire to make multiple, fun choices. Choices that have actions and different consequences were placed in the game itself to give more of an intense story than just boring passages and boring choices. I wanted to make the reader feel as if they were the main character as much as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee4/ee444baec9c13b3b03222835d3a7eb03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Austinj23"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
