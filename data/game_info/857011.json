Unfortunately, after six hours to develop the game to this point, having had\u00a0issues with blocking shield design, I settle in the end for a simple game as seen here.</p><p>After Trijam event I will go back and fix the game up into a better state.</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>Stay alive as long as possible\u00a0without being hit by the white orbs.</p><ul><li>You can place a shield to remove the white orbs with the following rules:</li><li>The shield can place anywhere except near the centre.\u00a0</li><li>During the first one sec, the shield is invulnerable and can destroy as many white orbs as possible without taking a hit.</li><li>After the first one sec, at least one hit will be required before the shield can be moved. The shield turns blue when it can be moved</li><li>The shield can take up to five hits before it is destroyed.</li><li>White obs will be generated every few secs and every time two white orbs touch and a new white orb is created.</li></ul><p>I hope you enjoy the game, Feedback is welcome.</p><p><strong>To Do...</strong></p><p>The things that I\u00a0wanted to do but there was not enough time</p><ul><li>A proper UI menu, title splash screen and instructions.</li><li>A recorded high score of the best time.</li><li>Add some graphics, the game currently uses simple prototype circles and squares.</li><li>That three shields could be placed each with its own cooldown.</li><li>A shield would grow until exhaust the hits threshold.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d685e7b8a7fe9d7fde75b4cfe1a85dbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stealthness"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
