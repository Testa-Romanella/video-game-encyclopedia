It's easy to learn and only takes a few minutes to play, no big commitment required.</p>\n<p><strong>Picture This!</strong> is a game that challenges the player's memory and reflexes by prompting them to quickly learn new pictures and then recognize them as they appear again. The faster the player can identify the pictures, the more points they will earn. The game is designed to be played from a web page, making it accessible for everyone.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the first game I built based on an idea of my own. I wanted to create a game easy to pick up and challenging for all audiences, ideally on a mobile device. This gave me an opportunity to explore several of the mechanics of Godot and practice creating my own art and sound effects. Despite this I also included artwork and music from free sources. While the game is playable it's hardly complete and requires much more work to calibrate the difficulty of the levels, improve gameplay and\u00a0polish its look and feel.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>When the game starts you'll see images sliding into the screen from the top. Each new image will be tagged to be sent to the left or to the right. When the same image appears again the player will score points by sending it to the same side - left or right - where it was sent the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Image types</strong></p>\n<strong>New image</strong><br/>Assign this image to the left or the right by using the arrow keys or the large buttons at the bottom sides of the screen. Remember your choice!<br/><strong>Random image</strong><br/>Wait for the image to be randomly assigned to one side or the other. And remember which side the image gets assigned to<strong>Score image<br/></strong>This image appeared before either as new or random and was assigned to the left or right side. Assign it again to the same side to score points. The faster you assign it the more points you score.<br/>\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Timer: images need to be assigned and recognized before the time runs out. If the timer runs out the game is over.</li><li>Twists: as the game progresses images need to be recognized under \"twists\" including changes in color, rotations and increasingly small display time</li><li>Levels: as you score points new levels are unlocked, which include shorter timers, more twists and faster accumulation of points</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game over</strong></p>\n<p>The game is quite unforgiving. The first time you run past the the timer or wrongly assign an image the game ends. Your best attempts and scores are saved in the hall of fame of Best Scores.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing <strong>Picture This!</strong> as much as I'm enjoying creating it. Please leave your comments and constructive feedback, even if brief, so I can keep improving.</p>\n<p>Thank you for giving it a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/398bc4db7a476099fde3e390affbe035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Low Odds"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
