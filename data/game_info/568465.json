You're also able to manipulate the human for a random amount of time between 1-3 seconds. After that you'll have a cooldown for 7 seconds.</p>\n<p>You can push trashcans in the player to slow him down. The thiefs also slow him down. The gray moving boxes are cars.</p>\n<p>You win when the human gets run over by a car or jumps over the apartment door at the end. You lose if the human reaches the apartment door safely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Points:</strong></p>\n<p>Trashcan: 10</p>\n<p>Thief: 50</p>\n<p>Car: 150</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controlls:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D - move left/right</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Q - manipulate human</p>\n<p>E - spawn trashcan</p>\n<p>Shift (while running against a trashcan) - grab trashcan</p>\n\n<p>I recommend playing it in fullscreen.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>\n<p>1: Complete all levels with 0 Points (This one I know is possible)</p>\n<p>2: Try stacking the to the top with the trashcans (This one I don't\u00a0know if\u00a0it'is possible)</p>\n<p>You could also just try stacking a bunch of trashcans and see how far you come.
