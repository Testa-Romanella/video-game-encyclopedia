We are planning on adding features in the future so any feedback is welcome :).</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>The aim of the game is to block all the holes with the meteors that are collected before you run out of oxygen. You have to match the size of the meteor with the size of the hole. If the rock size isn't what you need then pick up the rock and discard it to reveal another rock.\u00a0You need to survive till the timer runs out to survive.
