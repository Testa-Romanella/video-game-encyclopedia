{"id": 894539, "slug": "world-of-naples", "name": "World of Naples", "name_original": "World of Naples", "description": "When World of Naples is first entered, you encounter a flashy menu screen with the main world\u2019s tile-map, NPCs and different enemy characters. The menu buttons are multicolored and very cartoonish. All these assets alone set the mood of the game, which is a retro like experience with cartoonish graphics and sounds. It is also worth noting that the menu screen includes the number of deaths the player currently haves which relates to the gameplay loop that will be documented later.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you press the play button you get welcomed into the main level selection screen. The game has 4 main worlds that have different themes to them. Each world has a special gimmick and a boss you must fight before going to the other world. The game has no checkpoints, so every time you want to play you have to start from the beginning, but there is a way to replay specific levels. Coins are the main currency of the game; the use of coins is to unlock a specific level that you\u2019d want to play if you don\u2019t want to play from the beginning like in other retro games. It is worth noting that the level unlocks get reset when you exit the game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter selecting a level you\u2019ll be greeted with a very cartoony and colorful character selection screen. The screen displays the different character stats and main controls for the game. Each player has distinct mechanics, statistics, and level of difficulty. After selecting a character you\u2019ll be presented with a very aesthetically pleasing loading screen, and a random philosophical quote. The first level of the game is designated as a tutorial and an introduction to the gameplay loop, you\u2019ll be experiencing as a player. You\u2019re shown a rundown of the basic controls of the game, and you get introduced to the main plot of the story. The plot of the story in short words explains that the rainbow amulet has been stolen and the player (The hero) must help retrieve it or the world would lose its beautiful colors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the level progresses you get greeted by various soldier NPCs that give great intel into what you should do as a player and offer comedic relief. One of the main mechanics of the game is the rainbow timer reaching 0. As the timer gets closer to 0, the world\u2019s saturation starts to dim as the king foretold and as it reaches 0, you get a game over screen due to you not being able to complete the level in the due time. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main gameplay loop is. The player travels as quickly as he can killing enemies to get experience, getting small checkpoints around the level, and opening crates that could possibly contain something useful for the player or make his mission harder. As the player goes through the level, he\u2019ll get the opportunity to collect coins which will then be used to replay levels the player might be interested in, due to the retro like saving system the game uses. Many players could be led to believe that the game will be easy and handholding because of its cartoonish and blocky graphics but this is not the case. The game has a higher-than-average learning curve and requires precise movements to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe final level of each world contains a boss battle. At first, you\u2019ll go around a normal level looking for a gateway to the boss room. Once you get there, you\u2019ll be greeted by a boss getting summoned from the skies and its health bar being displayed on the screen. Each boss has a different gimmick and mechanics, for example: The first world\u2019s boss is a giant summons frogs to attack you and once enraged he\u2019ll start spawning faster toads from his mouth. The second world\u2019s boss follows the ice theme thus being an angry Viking that wants to hit you with his hatchet, he is also accompanied by 2 Viking arrow towers that will help him fight the player.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEven though the game doesn\u2019t contain that many levels it has a high level of replayability. Using the coins, you can replay any level or boss battle that has interested the player. Another aspect of the game that adds replayability is the character roster, there\u2019s 4 unique characters with different abilities, traits and stats that could make the game harder or easier after the first run. Finally, it provides a very happy and uplifting soundtrack and sound effects that mesh well with the story. The music dims down when the light is fading out of the world which adds more immersion into the gameplay. It adds a lot more to the cartoonish nature of the game and the feeling that you have to save this colorful land.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConclusion<br/>\r\nIn conclusion, World of Naples is a unique 2d platformer that helps us dive into the 90s arcade gameplay loop that many of the player would want to relieve. It offers a beautiful world that feels alive, a basic plot that adds to the gameplay experience, and beautiful soundtracks. The gameplay of the game is well polished and has its own unique styling to it that makes the game stand out from other platformers. The art and tile-sets of the game match the aesthetic each world is trying to present be it a hellish land or an icy slippery place. The art also serves a big purpose on the storytelling aspect of the game going from a very upbeat game to a very ominous and uncomfortable experience while running out of time.
