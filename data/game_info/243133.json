This week's prompt was camerawork, which was a tricky one! Unfortunately this week I didn't get a heap of time to work on it, so this week's project is a little buggy and ugly! Sorry about that! Also sorry for uploading it about four days late :P I'll have another project up by the end of the week! And since you can't see them very well the screenshots for this game is what's in the paintings.</p><p>In this project I used Ben Esposito's amazing character controller! I adapted the code shoddily so excuse that, the proper working controller can be found here! I've used it many times in the past and it's a delight to use.\u00a0http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T05:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa81899cdcfeb914c4d54745a3508a78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ketchapp", "Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ketchapp"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
