{"id": 850219, "slug": "the-ranch-lordofthedeep", "name": "The Ranch (lordofthedeep)", "name_original": "The Ranch (lordofthedeep)", "description": "<p>You\u2019ve just purchased a 500 acre cattle ranch in Utah, but almost immediately strange phenomena start happening every night terrorizing your cattle. Can you and your ranchers save your cattle from the paranormal threats?</p>\n<p>The Ranch is a fast-paced tower defense game similar to <strong>Plants vs. Zombies</strong>, but with a few twists. The goal of each mission is to protect your cattle from skinwalkers, blue orbs, and other paranormal entities using different ranch defenders. Each ranch defender can be moved to different lanes and upgraded with special abilities. If all of your cattle are killed in a mission you lose!\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first game and is based on the Skinwalker Ranch mythos. <strong>This free demo includes one episode with three missions (including a boss mission).</strong> Two different ranch defender types are included along with three different ability upgrades.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each mission has multiple waves of paranormal attackers. The paranormal attackers grow stronger with each additional wave.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each cattle generates a sum of money multiple times during a mission.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the money to purchase ranch defenders in each mission to stop the paranormal attackers from killing your cattle.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use your hotkeys (1-3) and mouse to purchase and place ranch defenders in each lane to protect your cattle.\r\n</p>\n<p>Select individual ranch defenders with your mouse to access their special abilities. Each ability can be selected with hotkeys (1-3) and has a cooldown time once used.\r\n</p>\n<p>The more cattle your save in each mission, the higher your bonus is at the end of each mission to purchase an upgrade. Any unspent money during the mission is also saved to purchase upgrades.\r\n</p>\n<p>If all of your cattle die during a mission, you lose the mission!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Note: At the end of each mission your game automatically saves. Starting a new game will overwrite your existing progress!</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Since this is my first game I welcome all of your feedback. Please let me know in the comments if you find any bugs!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:11:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/95287175fbc78ba85444810c27ed6736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lordofthedeep"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
