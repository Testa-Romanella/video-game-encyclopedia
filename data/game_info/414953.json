The Legendary Guardian is a multi genre bag, filled with top down action, adventure, exploration,\u00a0and of course shooting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking for active play-testers to gauge if the idea or concept is \"fun\".\u00a0 Fun for us means, it has good game play, you are actively interested in seeing where this project goes, you envision a whole host of possibilities with the current direction, it has a good foundation. Many things in this concept are not ironed out, and there are mostly stand in enemies and objects in this phase, but in starting this company out, I have decided to\u00a0take a shot with public feedback for my direction before further development on a project would be made. This is the first iteration of the game, we will host 2 more before deciding to continue with this project.</p>\n<p>Next Iterative phase will contain some fixed bugs,\u00a0a revised menu, and a new space shooting level and boss.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>-Rat mini boss cannot be fought.</p>\n<p>-Spider mini boss isn't always as aggressive as he should be, if for some reason the boss isn't there, you will have to exit the room and re-enter to continue.</p>\n<p>- A large grouping of SFX going off at once\u00a0can kill the music.</p>\n<p>- If pause menu is never brought up by pressing ESC during gameplay,\u00a0you will have to exit application by pressing ESC on the Main Menu before restarting, if you game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd7/dd736f79e816abf8332058bb253f6fda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["InDenial Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
