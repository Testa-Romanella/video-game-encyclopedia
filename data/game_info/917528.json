I've reflected this in my game by making a box that disappears when you're not looking at it.</p>\n<p>This game has several accessibility options, including subtitles and color correction, and additionally there is gamepad support, though that hasn't been tested and is not officially supported.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Movement: WASD<br/>Sprint: Left Shift<br/>Jump: Spacebar<br/>Interact: Left Mouse Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f80f41f5fbf92ded0341a167614a0cc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floris0106"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
