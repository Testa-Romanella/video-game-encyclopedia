Do it fast to accumulate combo and you will get even more score.</p>\n<p>But there is a twist. Tutorial checkpoints (the red barriers) made it into the actual game, forcing you to press a key (which doesn't do what it says it will) before allowing you to move again. So think smart and don't rush into it.\u00a0</p>Tips<p>Many people complain about the red barriers so here is some tips. You don't have to pass the barrier then attack the enemies behind it, you can instead bait the Sword Enemy to pass the barrier (By moving near it then backing away) and for the Pistol enemies you can deflect their bullets. For the Drone enemies, the bullets are harder to deflect but they take a long time to shoot, so in this case you would pass the red barrier first then attack it ASAP.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install\r\n<p>1.
