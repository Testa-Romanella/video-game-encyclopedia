Make good decisions, and try to survive until 476 to be victorious.<br/>If one of the 4 aspects reaches 0, you lose.</p>\n<p>The game can be finished in more or less 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>For this jam, I worked with my friend Vincart, we both worked on the game design and I was the developer. I wrote the code from scratch.<br/>We missed an opportunity to work with a graphic designer, so we used (mostly) free resources. The licensed resources (CC, etc) are given full credit in the pdf file that you'll find in the archive.<br/>We had in mind to add special historical events to be more \"historically accurate\" but it was too late in the jam to include them :( Maybe we'll add that in a future update.</p>\n<p>Only the mouse is required to play.</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f5bc7390634c48678a840691ef38999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exkaiser", "vincart"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
