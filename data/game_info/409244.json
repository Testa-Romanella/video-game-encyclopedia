It has a very simple story and its a small game.<br/>In this game you play a cyborg who was forced to crash land on a planet full of evil droids.<br/>To make a decision you press 1 or 2 on the keyboard. If you press number 1 you make the first decision, and if you press number 2 you make the second decision.
