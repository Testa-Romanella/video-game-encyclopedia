If you're nostalgic for retro games, or just looking for a good, challenging RPG, look no further.<br/><ul><li>Choose a party of humans, espers, robots, and monsters, each with a unique leveling scheme<br/></li><li>Employ over 500 combat items and abilities, either learned, looted, bought, or crafted<br/></li><li>Explore five unique worlds, each with their own story and characters, plus the sealed city of Varonis which unites them all...<br/></li><li>Enjoy the best of oldschool mechanics without the pain points: no required grinding, optional field encounter mode, and other newschool ideas</li></ul><h3>What lies beyond the gate?</h3>The city of Varonis once housed a wondrous portal. Wisemen and scientists emerged, bearing new technology and powerful artifacts. But when dangerous monsters also spilled out, the portal was sealed and the city abandoned. Jonas and Janine, two warrior twins, set out to discover what has become of the secret city, but when they fail to return, it is up to four village youths (and their trusty robot) to rescue them... and uncover the truth behind the gate of Varonis.<h3>The four races</h3>To challenge Varonis and the many trials beyond, you'll need to build your own party:<br/><ul><li>Humans - Sturdy generalists who buy potions to advance in stats. They carry swords, saws, shotguns, spellbooks... Versatility is key!<br/></li><li>Espers - Natural-born fighters that learn from combat, granting stats, abilities, and powerful multitarget magic.<br/></li><li>Robots - Customizable companions that can be built in many different ways. A tankbot made of armor? A ninjabot made of swords?<br/></li><li>Monsters - Scrappy shapeshifters whose role in combat can change in a flash. Most monster abilities can be found nowhere else.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T10:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/56580dbf30897764663aed87d08b7c90.jpg", "website": "https://varonis-rpg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wombat Logic"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wombat Logic"], "esrb_rating": null}
