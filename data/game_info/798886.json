The only way for them to escape is to fight them either by coping with them or running away from them.</p>\n<p>While walking around\u00a0the map, collect lightbulbs AKA ideas for moves to fight against the problems. Beware that there are clouds representing the main character's\u00a0problems floating around that should be avoided otherwise a turn-based fight will start.</p>\n<p>The combat is pretty simple, the player can select moves, which have certain effects. For example, one might deal damage or another could heal you. There are additional temporary effects that affect the player outside of combat like \"slowness.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Play Time:</strong>\u00a010-20 Minutes\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0Mouse and Keyboard (P to pause, Space to continue)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Anna Breuker: UI Design &amp; Programming</li><li>Ian Connors: Art &amp; Animation</li><li>Caleb Kahn: Overworld Design &amp; Programming</li><li>Noah Trillizio: Battle System Programming</li><li>Jacob Zydorowicz: Effects &amp; Sound Design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/32529cff2bd5028782eeb0a4cd4dd5ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EmptyWisp"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
