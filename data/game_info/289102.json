I'm quite proud of myself on this one, as essentially all content was produced by myself.\u00a0I would have liked to implement some music, but I was running out of time after I finished all of the polishing features, and didn't want to strain myself working all day long.<strong> I won't be able to publish a WebGL version of this game, as it always seems to crash with memory bugs.</strong>\u00a0<strong>Updates may come out in the future, but only time will tell.</strong> Well, that's all today! I hope to see all of you in the next game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06cc74e56af72f5ba03708f30e975cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheLiverMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
