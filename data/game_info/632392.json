I always wanted to make a snake game like this, since not many people are familiar with the concept - and I wanted to see what it's like if multiplayer mode was an option! It turns out it's a lot of fun when you play as a 'team' with a friend, and try to get the best possible score together.</p>\n<p>Scores are recorded in the 'high score' section for both single and multiplayer.</p>\n<p>Concept and design:\u00a0</p>\n<p>It differs from 'just another snake game' because the snake turns into stone after it hits a certain length and reverses back to its original starting size. When this happens one of the stone block turns into a bonus block, and the score multiplier increases. This allows the player to rake in a lot of score points the longer they play!</p>\n<p>The stone 'body' of the snake also makes a hazard, and acts as a wall.</p>\n<p>I hope people will have fun playing my first game I made with Unity!</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>~Marcus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T04:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5de2ed882a7fd4b10684cc47124b33a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Munnica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
