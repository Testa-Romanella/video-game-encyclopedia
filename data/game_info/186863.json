This was a project I received in my first year in college with the aim to remake the game and put my own unique spin on it. I enjoyed making this game, especially the sprites so I hope you receive some the joy playing it that I did making it. The entire game was made in Gamemaker and I created all the sprites using Pixen. I'd appreciate it if you could leave some feedback if you enjoyed the game and same again if you didn't. Thanks for playing, I really appreciate it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7d88b8eff024d2782fc05ce96630eb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JoeyWheeler"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
