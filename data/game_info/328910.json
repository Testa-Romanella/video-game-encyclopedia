I'm a graduate of New York University's Game Center, where I received my Game Design BFA in May of 2019. Rooms is a game that I made completely from scratch for my senior capstone project. I've been working on it for ~7 months, and I'm proud to finally be releasing it to the public.</p>\n<p>The game is definitely not without flaws, though I hope you will be able to enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed designing and making it. For more information and for more games from me, you can check out my itch or my portfolio site at\u00a0https://www.duydlam.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T03:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/279754614911c38a34b42bcf07542c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Duy Lam"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
