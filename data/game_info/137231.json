Sadly the game has glitches and feels very rushed...\u00a0 then, I decided to leave it as a Prototype: it is functional, but I believe we can't really call it a finished game, since it could be improved in so many ways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Anyway, we decided to upload it to get some feedbacks and commentaries. Thanks for checking out our game, and I hope you appreciate the game in its state despite the major flaws!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea06f230fdd88a075d5a81fc78ecdce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Delta Key"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
