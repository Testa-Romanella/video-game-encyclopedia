Since then it has shrunk substantially, and was sliced in half in 2008, with consequences uncertain to this day, by a 15-km causeway designed to shorten the travel time between the cities of Urmia and Tabriz.\"</p><p>This desire had gotten me to create a game based on a fictional narrative as the result of a class assignment. The guidelines pushed us towards keeping the game play as simple as finding and picking up objects. However, I'm planning to push this project further through fundraising, social awareness and advertisement in the close future. </p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>WASD.....Move</p><p>Left Shift....Run</p><p>Space.....Jump</p><p>Mouse pointer....Navigate</p><p><strong>Developers</strong></p><p>Nina Mirhabibi - mirhabibinina.wix.com/portfolio</p><p>Brian Leung - BrianLeung698.wix.com/charmman</p><p>Emmanuel Christohoides</p><p>Z1K0</p><p><strong>Artist</strong></p><p>Nina Mirhabibi </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66d3c295022f132a354e5eac8a4410dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Nina Mirhabibi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
