A little ball needs to navigate through the land to get towards his house to play \u201cP-Ball\u201d on\u00a0his Sony PlayStation. This game took me a while to complete, especially with my whole entire project crashing \u00a0down a few days ago, Yikes!\u00a0 I only worked about a few hours on\u00a0 it before the deadline and I plan on\u00a0 doing a big update soon. I also might re-release the original game for the jam as a bonus or something.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy this short treat to remind this generation of our past glory!\u00a0 ***UPDATE: Download is fixed now; Game is still a little buggy and I plan on fixing this in a few days***</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:47:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d973cc1a53506a77f410361681d6a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
