Your goal is to shoot down as many obstacles flying towards you as possible! Be careful! For each contact with an obstacle you lose 1 life, and you only have 3! The game starts quietly, but as time goes on, the gameplay gets more difficult! The vision gets smaller, Cubes show up more often and they fly faster! <strong>Hardcore mode? It's a completely different gameplay</strong> that you need to check out for yourself! Be the best among your friends and laugh in their faces that they can't aim at big flying blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Online Scoreboard!<br/></strong>This game has a scoreboard!
