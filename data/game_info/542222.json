With a pandemic on the horizon for the foreseeable future, dwindling software opportunities at my previous job, and a desire to make games since childhood still present in my soft-beating heart, I felt like it was finally time; the chance to get serious was now. Thus far, it has been an incredible learning journey, but one that I\u00a0often feel isolated in--which is not an indication of\u00a0the nature of the industry, rather, an aspect of my persona that carries over into everything I do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Fast forward a few months: it's winter, I am in the throes of creative flatlining and, for the sake of honesty, utterly defeated by a lifetime of consistent depression. I had stumbled across game jams in the past and always admired the participants, but found myself staring at Ludum Dare #47 with a theme that really fit the bill for my emotional state. So, naturally, having already missed the boat to compete--and not really confident that I could even if I hadn't--I\u00a0decided to challenge myself to make a game in 72 hours highlighting, well, the process that led to\u00a0making this game. Very meta, I\u00a0know.</p>\n<p>Attempting to make a game in 72 hours from absolute scratch is the single hardest thing I've tried to do, and, it's worth mentioning, I failed at it as well. This game was made in the ballpark of 5-6 days.\u00a0 That being said, this is my first game, my first failure, and, for once in my life, something I'm proud to have failed at. Each success is the destination of a road paved by the culminative bricks of failure. This is the first brick in mine.</p>\n<p>In order to play, just click the download button, extract into your favorite folder, and click the executable. Controls are point and click. Some stuff on the computer utilizes WASD or arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/8555e0b521b1c3b94e01b99b7f464418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["smolSoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
