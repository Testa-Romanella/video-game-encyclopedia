Taking a hit won't kill you, but will leave you vulnerable to another hit where you actually die. Your vulnerability is shown by the appearance of red smoke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0As you play the game as a normal shoot-em-up, your score depletes every 10 seconds, as the theme suggests. You can regain your score by hitting and defeating\u00a0enemies, along with taking the coins they sometimes drop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 6 types of enemies:</p>\n<p>- Black Ships, that don't shoot and give lots of points but are very tough.</p>\n<p>- Green Ships, that fires a single fast and large shot.</p>\n<p>- Blue Ships, that fire diagonally upwards and downwards.</p>\n<p>- Red Ships, that fire in the 4 cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>- Yellow Ships, that fire towards you.</p>\n<p>- Orange Ships, that fire randomly around.</p>\n<p>Try to gain the highest scores in two sections: the maximum possible score you achieved, and the longest amount of time you survived.</p>\n<p>Enemies come in waves, and it can technically go up infinitely, although the difficulty kind of caps at 20, and reaching wave 20 is a feat in and of itself. Comment your max score and survive time!</p>\n<p>Music was made by Cron Audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a42d3a6a372ad9a510856550abc340cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
