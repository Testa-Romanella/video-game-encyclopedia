Placed third.<br/></p><p>My first pure horror game! Apparently I was quite successful, because one player refused to keep playing after a certain event happened. I'm pretty happy with this one, both because the game is quite neat, and it's also a technical achievement in Twine. I'm pretty sure this was the first Twine game to feature a roaming NPC.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7edbda356da1ab2176f7d0d6faa478a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
