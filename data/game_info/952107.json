In this dark and otherworldly period of Russian history, the current financial crisis and rising crime rates appear bleak in comparison. And when a flying saucer crashes into local chairman&#39;s house, it\u2019s up to you to meet the aliens. Of all the locations on Earth, this forgotten settlement becomes a bustling center for science, exploration, and the supernatural; you\u2019re merely the poor chap whose home became the saucer\u2019s crash site.<br />\nAssuming the role of the collective farm\u2019s headmaster, you must filter visitors before let them inside the UFO. These guests from outer space are in no hurry to interact with humans, they\u2019d much rather steadily observe our species and our vast dreams and desires. What exactly might these extraterrestrial beings have planned?<br />\nThis isn\u2019t your stereotypical alien encounter. You will be tasked to learn about these otherworldly beings before they can properly study you.<br />\nKujlevka lets you play a role in charting a course through a financially and politically turbulent time in Russian history.<br />\nBeyond static dialog and walls of text, you can explore village life in Kujlevka through a mesmerizing atmosphere of the protagonist\u2019s dreams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-12T09:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6e1/6e1a9b43ded4862063c314bc335e3661.jpg", "website": "https://kujlevka.com", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 19, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 3, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Callback"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Crytivo"], "esrb_rating": null}
