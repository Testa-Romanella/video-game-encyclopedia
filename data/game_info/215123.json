{"id": 215123, "slug": "halleys-comet", "name": "Halley's Comet", "name_original": "Halley's Comet", "description": "<p>In my 12th grade science class, one of the very last projects we (the class) was assigned,\u00a0was to present about a celestial body in any format we'd like. Being the insufferable tryhard that I am, I decided to make a game about Halley's Comet.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as Halley's Comet as it orbits the sun, avoiding asteroids, UFO's, Elon Musk's Space Car, and moons. Like a real comet, you speed up as you approach the sun, and slow down the further you get. The game as a whole also speeds up with each successful orbit, and you can keep track of which year you can reach, starting from 0 A.D.. You even have the dust and ion tails, which point away from the sun!</p>\n<p>Being a comet isn't all dodging and flying though, as you can pick up some coins classily and cutely\u00a0called comet coins. With these coins, you can buy new looks for Halley's Comet. You can get a rainbow comet, a poorly drawn comet, or even become a peanut with a smiley face to fly through space.</p>\n<p>This wasn't intended to be an actual, full\u00a0game or anything, so there's only a couple of things to buy in the store, and it doesn't save your progress. It's still pretty neat though, so maybe check it out?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b539cf7f0b20bcebde668735b4528666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["robert0504"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
