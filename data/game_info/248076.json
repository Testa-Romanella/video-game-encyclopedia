Very sorry about this, But it was made for a gamejam and i ran out of time by the time i discovered this oversight.

Then buy a pig and upgrade it until its working at 0.5s a tick. Then upgrade it so it gives you 10 sticks every 0.5seconds. This gives you a good baseline for automatic income.</p>\n<p>Then upgrade to a wood hut asap, as 1 click on a wood hut gives you 1 wood + 10 sticks per click, So it's the fastest way to get sticks quickly.</p>\n<p>Repeat the above process with the wood hut, then upgrade a second and repeat.</p>\n<p>Then upgrade one to a stone and repeat the above.</p>\n\n<p>Repeat until you own 20 brick huts. Oh and don't forget to repair! it's easy to forget and lose a hut to those pesky wolves.</p>\n<p>Any feedback?
