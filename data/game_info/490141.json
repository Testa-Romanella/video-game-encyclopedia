I've looked all over the internet for ClickyGames or anything they have made, but there was nothing. The SD card looked old, so I assumed the game was abandoned long ago. Giving it a try, it seems there are some gameplay elements that require a later version, so I'm trying to find out how to update the game. It seems like it was made in HTML 5 in 2012, judging by the games content. It's also interesting to note that this is potentially a fifth game in a series, so maybe there are some older titles. in the meantime, here are the instructions:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move during gameplay and mouse to navigate the menus.</p>\n<p>Yeah that's it. This is definitely an early version of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:50:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e8/2e88791d1338d8fb30ba70bd8f7c8304.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clicky Games REUPLOAD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
