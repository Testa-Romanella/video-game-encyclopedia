{"id": 820361, "slug": "who-rolls-the-dice", "name": "Who Rolls the Dice?", "name_original": "Who Rolls the Dice?", "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how your favorite rogue-like creates its dungeon? Have you ever wondered, \u00a0\"Who rolls the dice?\" Well wonder no more, as the answer is \"You!\" Take your place behind the scenes as the designer of a dungeon for a rogue-like! Become the one who rolls the dice to determine a dungeon's layout. Watch as a little hero crawls through the dungeon you design!</p>\n<p>This is my submission to the 2022 GMTK Game Jam! The theme was \"Roll of the Dice.\" Normally when you play a rogue-like it's a <strong><em>roll of the dice</em></strong> for what room is up next in the dungeon. So my interpretation of that was to reverse the rolls roles and have the player determine the outcome of someone else's dungeon delve.<br/></p>\n<p>I created this game over the course of 48 hours (excluding time when I ate and slept). I did use pre-existing art and music (as credited in the game), but all the code I did myself. I am a coder at heart and I am really proud of the AI that I wrote for the player and all the monsters. It's not perfect and sometimes it's buggy but we wrap it up, put a bow on it, and call those intentional game features.</p>\n<p>[itch is having a hard time uploading my screenshots]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b880377b960bc400c9061461c1256ad1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["p13_l0v3r"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
