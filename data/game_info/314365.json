The theme of the hackhathon was to make a game that teaches programming to kids in an easy and fun way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our group chose to make a VR game in which the player stands in the middle of an entirely white colored world. The player is then supposed to join together pieces of codes. Each time the player gets a correct answer, it projects the action of the code to the environment so for example if the bit of code is meant to change color of an object, that object in the environment will gain color etc.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple. You just need to click, drag and drop pieces of codes using the trigger and the pad buttons.</p>\n<p>The game is complete once you have completed all the codes and the environment comes to life!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/091/09191f2689a11e1b5a60899995a31180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dro Hoshi", "laloopadoo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
