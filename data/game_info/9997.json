The game is set on fictional Greece-themed islands in the near future during the war between NATO and Iran. In the campaign mode you take on the role of Corporal Ben Kerry, who takes part in this conflict. There are three chapters in the campaign but you can complete separate missions during the multiplayer mode.</p>\n<p>Arma\u2019s key feature is its realistic battles. It\u2019s not another military shooter where you can get an upgraded gun and go kill dozens of enemies. Instead, the game suggests you feel like a real soldier with all dangers and difficulties you can experience. That\u2019s why you need to think over your tactics and protection, be patient and ready for long runs. Arma 3 provides you with a great amount of weaponry suitable for your playstyle.</p>\n<p>Arma 3 is the third main installment in the series. It\u2019s a follower to ARMA: Armed Assault, ARMA 2 and their multiple DLCs, and is extended with nine expansions.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2013-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:29:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7a2/7a2d3c0883f01e43bff02f0d124d4642.jpg", "website": "http://www.arma3.com", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 81, "owned": 2373, "beaten": 109, "toplay": 45, "dropped": 222, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 16, "achievements_count": 106, "ratings_count": 374, "suggestions_count": 564, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 379, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bohemia Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Bohemia Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
