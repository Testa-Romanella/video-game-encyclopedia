This is my first real venture into game design as I am mainly a programmer. I've always loved indie horror games on steam and figured making a game with a collection of some of my favorite aspect of those games would be a great way to pay homage. <p>That's exactly what Giggles Carnival of Horrors is a collection of horror mini games each having a unique gameplay mechanic or AI. The Demo includes 3 maps/horrors to beat. </p><p>I would like to see how interested people would be in actually seeing a game like this finished which is why I am posting it up here. I honestly do not know if I am cutout for game design as this is my first venture into it. With that being said I hope the community on here will help steer me in the right direction as it has for so many other game designers trying to make a name for themselves </p><p>The gameplay video and screenshots included here show each aspect of the demo maps as well as a creepy carnival lobby map! :D </p><p>STEAM GREENLIGHT PROJECT LINK:<br/>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...<br/><br/></p><p>Features :</p>3 Different Maps centered around a horror(AI) that is locked up in Giggles Carnival. <p>The Demons Maze:</p>Classic jumpscare key find game with a huge maze and random key spawn to explore. All while being hunted by The Demon. <p>The Queens Dungeon:</p>Focused around weapon use in a beat em up style dungeon with a boss and minion fight. <p>Krasue's Diary:</p>A page hunt game much in the vein of Slenderman. The player must hunt for pages of the diary while being stalked by Krasue. <p>F.A.Q.</p><p>When will the game be released?</p>No full game release date as I am waiting to see the community reaction. <p>How much will it cost?</p>The Demo is FREE! <p>What Languages will be supported?</p>English <br/>Planning to have text/subtitle support for other languages. <p>What platforms does the game support?</p>Just Windows 7,8,10 right now but I do plan to do a linux build if i can I find a proper computer to test it on. I also plan to add gamepad play which will allow play on console. <p>Please check my website and this page for the latest updates of the game.</p>Giggles Carnival Of Horrors Website <br/>http://michaelcosio88.wixsite.com/giggles <p>If you have any questions or comments please email me at <br/></p><p>MichaelCosio88@gmail.com</p><p>If you like what you see or have suggestions please leave and comment and Upvote!<br/><br/>Steam Greenlight<br/>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...<br/><br/>EXTERNAL DOWNLOAD LINK FOR DEMO:<br/></p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/tmxqh7bmcyd85u3/Giggles_...<br/><br/>just in case you have problems downloading from this site.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad1/ad1d08c35085fdf5dd20019bcfcbd1cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["michaelcosio88"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
