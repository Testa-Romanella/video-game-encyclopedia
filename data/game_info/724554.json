I wanted to do something short, like 1 week dev. Actually, it ended up being 2 weeks with the little polish and fix here and there, but it was OK.</p>\n<p>I challenged myself to code a A* star path planning in destructible environments that ran in real time (I had to implement time slicing because my PC wasn't good enough).</p>\r\nGame Rules\r\n<ul><li><strong>Goal</strong>: On each level, get the sword(s) and escape far away from the buildings (in any direction you want). Just get far enough (in reality you have to leave the level area).</li><li><strong>Controls</strong>: arrows or [zqsd] + space\u00a0+ mouse. By default it\u2019s AZERTY-friendly, but you can change the config in 5s on the splash screen. You can mouse wheel to zoom in/out.</li></ul>\r\nLevel Editor\r\n<ul><li>Use Paint or whatever image software you like to create a PNG file with a black background in the \u201cLevels\u201d directory. Levels don\u2019t need to be huge to be fun; 100x100px is already enough, but you can create whatever size you want.</li><li>Blue pixel (0,0,255): player (it\u2019s the minimum requirement for a level to be playable)</li><li>Red Pixel (255,0,0): enemy. Don\u2019t put too much of them, it can slow down the game, but it depends on the power of your computer\u2026</li><li>Yellow Pixel (255,255,0): path for the enemies. An enemy will follow a path if he\u2019s just NEXT TO a yellow pixel. You can use a single yellow pixel to make an enemy move to it an look in that direction.</li><li>Grey Pixel (128,128,128): wall</li><li>White Pixel (255,255,255): goal (sword). You can set multiple goals if you want</li><li>Purple 1 (255,0,255) : life bonus</li><li>Purple 2 (255,64,255) : ammo bonus</li><li>Purple 3 (255,128,255) : bomb bonus</li><li>Purple 4 (255,192,255): mine bonus</li><li>Green (0,255,128): a cherry tree :)</li></ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t hesitate to check out the available levels to get an idea of the color use. Be careful, you need to use the exact color codes (R,G,B) described above.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d050ec266c8f0026d9e80a929282d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oneiric Worlds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
