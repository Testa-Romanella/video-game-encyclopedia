It's an endless combat game, when you start the waves, enemies which are Dai Li Agents; will start to attack you. There is a kill counter and timer on top of the screen. You can submit your time and kill score in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>We are Avatar fans before Game Developers, we always wanted to make an Avatar fan-made game but we never got the chance. When we learned the theme we said \"Avatar\"\u00a0all together... We didn't make a story behind this game we just wanted to give a good combat experience. We hope we succeeded.</p>\n<p>You can find the controls on a wall in game but to mention:</p>\n<p><em>You have Health Bar, Mana, Ulti Bars &amp; Current Element sign on the top-left</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Q\u00a0- Change Element\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Right Click\u00a0- Aim\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Left Click\u00a0- Light Attack\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>E\u00a0- Special Attack\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\r\nF\u00a0- Ulti AttackYou have to aim for using Special Attacks on some Elements don't forget that\r\n\n\n<p>Made by Opulence\u00a0with Love</p>\n<p><em><strong>Murat Can \u0130naltekin (Developer)\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Deniz \u015eeker (3D Artist)\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>\u00d6mer Salih Sar\u0131 (2D &amp; Game Designer)\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Ahmet Eren O\u011fuz (3D Artist)\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Buse Ergen (3D Artist)</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Assets</em></p>\n<p><em>Yes, we used assets, generally we prefer to make our own assets.
