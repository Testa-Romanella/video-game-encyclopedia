You and your team use all the hunting equipment in order to banish an evil poltergeist and save the poor souls from torment while uncovering deeply disturbing secrets.<br />\nHaunt Chaser will start with Season One Orphanage. Then we will continue to release more different themed seasons for free. The orphanage is where you will start to experience the terror with your other four Chaser friends. You must work together, then maybe... maybe you can survive. Remember it will smell your skin, every step you land will be heard by the darkness himself. The children didn&#39;t know that!
