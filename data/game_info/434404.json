Replenish his hunger with the red food button, and his thirst with the blue button while stopping the weeds from touching him. But fret not! There is a weedkiller barrier protecting him for now, so be careful! It will eventually disappear by being touched by a weed or when you get past 800 score.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use mouse to kill enemies by clicking on them, and click on the red and blue buttons to feed and give water to Spudfill the Potatomoid. Keep him alive!<br/></p>\n<p>Developer's note:</p>\n<p>This was a quickly built game, as I had no idea Ludum Dare was taking place. When I found out it was I decided to participate because I have never done it before, so it is a great opportunity! Thank you for your time and I hope you have fun playing!
