Let\u2019s hang out for a moment and I\u2019ll show you this fun game I made up. I\u2019m Hazel Andramano, BTW.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Maybe you're like me and you feel like your lazy weekends really need some, well, drama. Not like the kind you'd normally get from movies, TV, or whatever. I mean like real-life, at-the-mercy-of-fate, no-margin-for-error MAYHEM, but no one gets hurt \u2018cuz it\u2019s a card game. So yeah, that\u2019s Dramanoes in a nutshell.<br/></p>\n<p>I don't have anything else important to do today. <br/>Guess I\u2019ll get us some drinks and we\u2019ll play a few rounds. You down?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>Two players (or one player and the computer) start with ten randomly selected numbered cards (Dramanoes), face down.<br/>During each turn, both players pick a Dramano to show each other. Once  both players have picked a Dramano, they are flipped over, face-up, to  reveal a number between 1 and 12.<br/>The player whose face-up Dramano has a higher (or lower, depending on  the game mode) number than the other's flips it back over, face down.  The other player discards theirs.<br/>The player who can make their opponent run out of Dramanoes wins the game!  </p>\n<p> \u00a0  </p>\n<p> Controls:<br/>Left and Right: move selection cursor<br/>Fire (red button): select Dramano<br/>Up: quick-assess Highlighted Dramano<br/>[If the highlighted Dramano's value is 7 or higher, it will nudge slightly. A potentially valuable strategy tool!]<br/>Down: reshuffle (re-randomize) your remaining Dramanoes<br/>[Can be done anytime, though best used in the case of a draw, the hope of improving your chances of winning, etc.] <br/>Select switch OR Left Joystick Left and Right on game select screen: choose game mode. (see below)<br/>Reset switch OR Left Joystick Fire on game select screen: starts/restarts the game.  <br/> Left Difficulty Switch: SINGLE PLAYER MODES - affects the probability that  the Computer player will reshuffle their own Dramanoes after a certain  point. You'll know that it shuffled when its cursor turns yellow.<br/>Right Difficulty Switch: SINGLE PLAYER MODES - affects randomness and  amount of time the Computer player takes to select a Dramano.  </p>\n<p> \u00a0  </p>\n<p> Game modes:<br/>1 - Singleplayer, larger number wins<br/>2 - Singleplayer, smaller number wins<br/>3 - Two player, larger number wins<br/>4 - Two player, smaller number wins <br/></p>\n\n<p>Program and artwork by me.
