In an attempt to take a closer look at this intriguing building, 2 guards hear something; they investigate, and find you. After you try to escape, they catch up with you, and take you prisoner, in a dark, damp room. As the guards go to find a bite to eat, you are able to climb into a vent. Just as you are clambering the vents, the end of the vents comes closer, at the end, there's a grate. This is your only option now, so you need to take it. After frantically running through the numerous corridors, you slam the exit button. As soon as you press against it, you realise that you have just released all the mutated test subjects. You only have seconds left unless you can find a way out.<br/>\r\nYou need to fix the problem you caused, before the world suffers from your mistake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T02:46:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4a8724d2587180c80f83734c36f06e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZombEYE Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZombEYE Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
