Who, by now, should know they really shouldn't let him drag them through hell and back.</p>\n<p>Team Barazzante always craved working on videogames, and the notion of translating a videogame always felt like a pipe dream - until now, thanks to LocJam5.</p>\n<p>Let's walk you through the team, we ain't many.</p>\r\nNicola Cascarano, alias Coldest Heaven \u2022\r\nMentally unstable, addicted to videogames, learned English solely through them. Studies specialized translation and yearns for a career in videogame localization. His bachelor thesis on videogames as therapy and his currently-in-progress master's thesis on a videogame localization (not this one, alas) are his proudest pieces of writing someone has had the misfortune of reading. Acted as the project manager to lead the effort throughout the duration of the event, helped as a translator, revisor, dubber and contributed to the contents of this awful page. And the logo. Especially that logo.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Guia Bonariva, alias Rayme\r\nBright-eyed translator student, former university mate, soon-to-be successful project manager whether she likes it or not. Her thesis on localization and her interest in video games made her an easy pick, not to mention her insight on translating subtitles which helped greatly trim out the fat; her reliability and cookie-providing skills are only on par with her Google skills. Acted as a translator, revisor, dubber and friend. Sometimes letting your leader steam off is better than helping them keep their cool.\r\n\r\nAris Griziotti Basevi e Antonietta Molica \u2022\r\nSmart, that guy. If only a bit of a douche. Former university roommate, the closest thing to a brother; sadly, he betrayed the path of the translator to walk the one of the teacher. Bless him for teaching newer generations what the days of eld were like in the videogame landscape, instead of being \"that\" teacher. Acted as a translator, revisor, dubber and friend. The kind of friend that keeps your ego in check. Props to his girlfriend Antonietta for dubbing Doorian (or Portia, as well call her).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Vincenzo Aliperti, alias Contro1990\r\nFor one who talks about himself as a non-committing person, he's been the most enthusiastic when I mentioned the idea. And the one I had to threaten the least. I actually didn't have to. Made me feel less like a huge jerk, and more like this project could be fun for everyone. He is the one behind the technical stuff, going through the code and bashing his head on the desk like a pro. Without his efforts, we would have just submitted a normal translation. Also would have totally forgotten about decorating this page. Aside from single-handedly dealing with the more dev-related stuff, he contributed to the translation, revision and dubbing process. Also, the name of the team? His idea.\r\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSpecial thanks to Davide Furlan Chicrozor for contributing to the Italian translation<br/>and Simone Damiani (Scorpion1190) for dubbing the Flat Bro!\r\n\n\n<p>So here we are, at the end of the page. Really, nothing more to add. It was a blast. Hope you liked our attempt and feel free to leave a comment!
