The options were: Flappy Bird(done that already, check my other games), Defender(I was involved in a similar game, also on my Itch) and Frogger.</p>\n<p>As I had already made games for the other 2 games, I chose Frogger. I had the option to create or source the assets online to use but the code had to be 100% my own. I chose to make the assets and audio.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is basic but has a random change to the obstacle movement speed. Go for the high score and let me know what you get :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbc/dbc93ebfdb408096207efc625a85c850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwistdRabbit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
