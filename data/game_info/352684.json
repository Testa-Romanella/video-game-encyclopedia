I worked on this project all by myself excluding some designs and all audio that's in the game. I programmed and designed the character and enemies and the attacks.</p><p><strong>Brief Overview of the Game:</strong><br/></p><p>The jam went on for a week and wanted to create something simple yet somewhat fun. I was heavily inspired by Gunkid 99 and the mechanics of shooting and level progression so i tried to replicate it with my own twist and having gone with the theme of \"Space\".\u00a0 It's simply a shooter where the player must survive and collect a certain amount of orbs to able to win the level. I didn't add a level progression due to limited time but that would've been the case of progressing throughout different levels.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Background Art / Level Art -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/11784</p><p>Music - Sirius Beat (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzIvArw09BmICMQFC5EZv7w)</p><p>Sound Effects (SFX)</p><p>Jump -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Tissman/sounds/445157/</p><p>Click - https://freesound.org/people/akelley6/sounds/453027/</p><p>Win Level -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/gamer127/sounds/457547/</p><p>Collecting Orb -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/StudioCopsey/sounds/77245/</p><p>Player Shoot -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/333691/</p><p>Explosion -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/448226/</p><p>Enemy Shoot -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/sharesynth/sounds/341235/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aaafd948cb09c7fc537345ac1714271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vin Codes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
