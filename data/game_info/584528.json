Starting with a small loan of 10,000 gold, you know that you can make it rich!</p>\n<p>Tutorial:<br/>Press space to pause, and the arrow keys to slow down/speed up time. Use the mouse for everything else.<br/>Each town has a supply and a demand for the 8 materials in the game. At the end of every day, towns with high demand for a certain material will buy that material from you, giving you\u00a0money for each material they buy.\u00a0Move supplies from towns with high supply and low demand by loading those supplies into wagons, and clicking on the cities you want the supplies to go to.</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the 2021 College Gam\u00a0Jam. The theme of connection inspired us to make a game about economic connections, and how a player can affect that sort of simulation.</p>\n<p>Team Members:<br/>Nicholas\u00a0Browning - Code, Design<br/>Dominic Vasi - Map Art,\u00a0UI Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/91363396ff8e40cc6230ab86cb03a1af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick Browning"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
