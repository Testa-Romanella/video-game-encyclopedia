You can destroy the pipe you've built by clicking at it, as long as no liquid flows through it. Wasting pipes cost points. Try to fill crosses for extra points.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Yngvarr - code.\r\n</li><li>Syudzius - graphics.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Used assets:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Music: In the City by Joshua McLean (via\u00a0itch, check his music out, its amazing!)\r\n</li><li>Sound Effects:<ul><li>Factory environment mix\u00a0by jsbarrett\r\n</li><li>explosion_05.wav\u00a0by derplayer\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>PIXI.js for rendering.\r\n</li><li>PIXI-sound for sound.\r\n</li><li>Aseprite &amp; GIMP for graphics.\r\n</li><li>Ocenaudio &amp; Audacity for sound editing.\r\n</li><li>vim for editing code.\r\n</li><li>btw, I use Arch.</li></ul><p>Contains music \u00a92021 Joshua McLean (https://joshua-mclean.itch.io) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde586d0f9e9299bf8c89c5213fa813d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yngvarr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
