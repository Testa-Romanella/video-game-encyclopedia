Players need to constantly purchase followers, spells, and artifacts to strengthen their lineup, and then challenge new enemies<br/>\r\nThis game currently has 118 followers, 110 spells, and artifacts<br/>\r\nThe game has many unique gameplay features that are different from other self moving chess pieces<br/>\r\n1\u3001 Fighting takes more than one turn<br/>\r\nTavern Flag and Dota Go, as they are PvP, end with just one round of play. However, this new game has more than one round of combat as it is a solo game<br/>\r\nYour chess pieces may all have residual health, and at this time, you can also pull the chess pieces from the standby area to fight<br/>\r\nTwo larger battlefields<br/>\r\nThe battlefield is divided into two rows and ten positions, and the enemy must attack the front row first before attacking the back row<br/>\r\nThe attack sequence is from left to right, from top to bottom, with priority given to attacking the enemy directly opposite<br/>\r\nUse three spells and artifacts to strengthen your troops<br/>\r\nAfter the battle, purchase followers, spells, and artifacts in the store. Spells can permanently strengthen your followers, while artifacts are passive and powerful effects that take effect<br/>\r\nLastly, there's a little bit of my complaint<br/>\r\nThe game is almost finished, but there is no psychological foundation at all. It is purely a personal creation, and it is difficult to find someone to test and listen to my thoughts<br/>\r\nHow can I make the game more fun? It's driving my brain crazy<br/>\r\nI am only one person, so art, music, and so on can only rely on existing materials. I always cannot compare with big companies, and my energy is focused on gameplay<br/>\r\nThe current 200+followers, spells, and relics have been accumulated and produced one by one from the past to the present. It is really a huge and long process<br/>\r\nI have also opened up to it now. It's okay if you don't make money, as long as someone likes it, just let it be a dream come true for yourself<br/>\r\nIn the future, if I join Steam, it will only cost 6 yuan. Although the quality is higher than the previous one and I should raise the price, I have no confidence in my psychology<br/>\r\nI'm afraid that some people might say it's not fun, but what's even more frightening is that there's no one to provide feedback<br/>\r\nAnyway, that's the situation<br/>\r\nThis game has a group, 733241134. Welcome to the group to provide valuable advice. Let's bitterly complain about this game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T06:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55f9705e93d7b8faa52674ac7ebe60d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u91cd\u529b\u718a\u732b"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u91cd\u529b\u718a\u732b"], "esrb_rating": null}
