But keep an eye on the non supporters, before they become a problem for your success.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to keep the attendants at your speech waving, this will keep the president happy. As soon as some of them stop moving, focus them for a moment with your \"eyes\" and they start waving again.</p>\n<p><strong>+++ Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The Popular Wave was designed to be played with Tobii Eye Tracker which was one of the technology diversifiers in that year (Beyond the doors of perception - Tobii Sponsored).</p>\n<p>Since we can not assume everybody has one at home ;-) you can also play with your mouse. Whenever the game says \"Look at\", just move your pointer over the target and wait for the bar to fill.</p>\n<p><strong>+++ Global Game Jam</strong></p>\n<p>Link: https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/popular-wave<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c12ecb4667da1e142f0fedc4caf2868b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["firegate666"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
