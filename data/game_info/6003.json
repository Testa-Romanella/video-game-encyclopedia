During his lifetime, he managed to produce some 13,000 pages of diagrams, drawings, and notes which combined art and science. He devised many contraptions and engineering wonders ahead of his time, and many which could not be built with the materials and science of the day, including hydraulic pumps, crank mechanisms, and even a steam cannon.<br/><br/>Many of his drawings of machines and contraptions contained missing elements, as if he had not fully developed the drawings and schematics.
