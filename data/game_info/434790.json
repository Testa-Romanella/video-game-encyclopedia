Ozwomp will come, Ozwomp has to come! ITS A GAME CALLED OZWOMP IS ARRIVING!!!</p>\n<p>But really, here is a game I made over the last 2 days in Three.js and using a very simple engine I made myself some weeks ago. Im a bit sick of Unity owning game design and I think its about time we took the power back!</p>\n<p>This is arguably my first narrativeish game and definitely the first time doing all sound design, I guess its also the first time making a real project with web tech too.
