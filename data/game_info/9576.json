Okay now imagine that each other player is a real person. Okay now imagine you're in first person, and you have this super awesome cannon with dozens of combinations of spins that fires a yellow ball at 400km/h. Okay now imagine you've fired that into the top corner at that speed - and someone saves it. That is supraball!\"</strong><br/>Solomon<br/><br/><strong>\"So the first thing that I liked was the innovation, there are no games like it.\"</strong><br/>Malaria<br/><br/><strong>\"The game being a first person sports game made me feel like I was actually on the field playing ball. Also, the fact that everyone on the playing field was an actual person, and not a scripted AI that would change into the player if given the ball, added an element I personally had never seen in a game before Supraball.\"</strong><br/>Skel<br/><strong>\"F**k yes, I can play football at home!\"</strong><br/>Silw<br/><strong>\"The thing that fascinated me the most is the amount of teamwork involved and the kind of creativity you can have while playing this game.\"</strong><br/>Bakes<br/><strong>\"It's pretty easy to play but hard to master.\"</strong><br/>Olo<br/><br/><strong>\"Most fascinating is the ability some players have to always create new moves etc.\"</strong><br/>Goku<br/><br/><strong>\"Different things happen every match, so it's never the same.\"</strong><br/>Dimle<br/><br/><strong>\"I liked being the last hope for my team and the tense pressure filled moments were amazing. Making a 1v1 save is a really awesome feeling and no other game has given me the same feeling yet.\"</strong><br/>Vendetta<br/><br/><strong>\"Very precise, accurate, total control. Intense gameplay, nail biting finishes.<br/>I can't stop, it's heroin/crack!\"</strong><br/>Revan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T13:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/238b9bcc2b658e38be965b16c9e39075.jpg", "website": "http://www.supraball.net", "rating": 2.07, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 32, "owned": 910, "beaten": 6, "dropped": 31, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Supra Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
