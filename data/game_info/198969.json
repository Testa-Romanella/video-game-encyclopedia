The presence of this revolutionary technology is felt nowhere more deeply than the city of its creation, Tokyo, where it powers everything from vehicles to homes and beyond. The Akita Drive\u2019s creator, Dr. Akiko Ishikawa, founded Hachik\u014d Electric Industry to show society the good that it could do, and her pioneering work culminated in the development of Mechassists. These autonomous service robots are constructed for specific tasks such as cooking, construction and traffic control and designed to blend into everyday life.<br/></p>\n<p>There\u2019s just one problem; Crashbat Heavy Syndicate. This malevolent organisation is obsessed with obtaining the plans for the Akita Drive and using them for their own dark purposes. Using an army of their own hacked robots, they plan to invade the streets of Tokyo and lay siege to Hachik\u014d Electric Industry headquarters in Shibuya. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the doctor activates the Machine Codex; an AI routine which transforms a team of previously docile Mechassists into an elite fighting unit. The abilities that were once used to serve humanity now represent its last line of defense. Machines unite!</p><p>You, a ramen chef bot turned war machine, must fight through hordes of rogue robots and ensure that Tokyo's future is safe.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a short level test that I had created for a college project, as I study Game\u00a0Design. Please tell me your thoughts of the game and thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15c46720370ad5ec7ccd04e1d023d82d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hashi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
