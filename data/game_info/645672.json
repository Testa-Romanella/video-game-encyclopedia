Fight waves of enemies in a high intensity arena to survive. To grapple with the onslaught of enemies, you are given an unholy gun (sponsored by your friendly demon judge), as well as the special ability to manipulate the speed of time (\u2018Bullet Time\u2019). Throughout the chaos of each level, wield this ability and your weapon to\u00a0 defeat the creatures of purgatory. Between each wave of enemies you will be confronted by an Angel and Demon, your totally impartial judges, both offering you a path to the afterlife. Collect the soul essence\u00a0 of the creatures you kill during each wave to trade with your judges. Trade to get upgrades to help you survive longer, and increase your chances of winning a better resting place for eternity. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0a9a7523e756793664445a080bbde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
