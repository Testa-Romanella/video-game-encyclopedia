Enemies insta-kill you on contact. Each camera shot will destroy any enemy in line of the camera flash, but beware - you have a limited amount of exposures! <br/></p>\n<p>I especially ran out of time near the end to polish the gameplay as much as I'd like - I think there's definitely a solid concept here, but I do think it'd make a better puzzle game concept than it does here as an arcade high score game. The concept is sound, but the execution here does not impress (and I'm the one who made it!).</p><p>Find the dev log here: </p><br/><p>Find the assets and code freely available here: http://lucassaturn.co.uk/dev/trijam214/<br/></p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T08:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f6/4f6d125198c7dcf31507227fe2aedced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LucasSaturn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
