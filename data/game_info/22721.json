It seemed that a new age had dawned, an age of lasting unity between nations, but this was not the case. Instead the fight for global supremacy had only been forced underground into the battlefield of covert ops and evil acts of terror.<br />\nInto this arena sprung a new force. Masked behind the guises of subterfuge, plausible deniability and information management, the Institute for Geotactical Intelligence raised the sword against those who would subjugate the world.<br />\nThough the malignancy of terrorism has broken our world on occasion, the global crucible has not yet boiled over into World War III. For that thank the one-man army David Jones and the forever-unsung heroes of IGI.<br />\nMultiplayer notice: online multiplayer mode is available after register your unique CD-key for the game.
