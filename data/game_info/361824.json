While enjoying a beautiful ride with your kids to an undisclosed location the car's entertainment system lost connection to the main servers and you got logged off it! What a tragedy! Now your kids DEMAND you to log in again so they can continue watching their favourite children show \"Only one finger John\". Be a considerate parent and drive while trying to log in with one finger only (because you only have one I don't know if you noticed) but be careful not to crash! or the entertainment system will crash too!</p><p><strong>(this is just a game! Don't do this in real life! Drive safely and don't text!)</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Use the mouse as if you were using only one finger (because the story demands so)<br/>To turn left and right to avoid the red cars tap with your only finger on the left and right buttons to the sides of the screen.<br/>To input your user and password use the keyboard (not your own one but the one in the game)<br/>To login tap the <strong>Login</strong> button<br/><br/>You can drag the sticky notes by dragging them with your only finger so they stay away from the keyboard (just like how it happens in real life)</p>\n<p><strong>SOURCE CODE<br/></strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/mrcdk/gmtk_gamejam_2019<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming<br/></strong>mrcdk</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics sources and copyright:</strong><br/>https://opengameart.org/content/toon-road-texture<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/car-sedan<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/car-pickup<br/>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram...<br/>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto<br/>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rock+Salt<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/cursor<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/rough-small-signs-symbol-pack<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/smoke-particle-assets<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-particles-sprite-atlas<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/game-icons</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds sources and copyright:</strong><br/>https://freesound.org/people/AndrewAlexander/sounds/369045/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Vosvoy/sounds/172096/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/newagesoup/sounds/348239/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Iwiploppenisse/sounds/156031/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/RutgerMuller/sounds/104026/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/wrc4all/sounds/403058/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/kagateni/sounds/404358/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/xtrgamr/sounds/432886/</p>\n<p><strong>Music sources and copyright:</strong><br/>Music from https://filmmusic.io<br/>\"Hitman\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Brightly Fancy\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79f5d7d22ab04b2ebc06f05a9321658c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Justo Delgado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
