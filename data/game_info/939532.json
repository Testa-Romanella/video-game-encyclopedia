Thanks for dropping by, this is my entry for Mini\u00a0Jam 127:\u00a0Cats, and it's a single screen survival game about a orange fluffy named CatJam!</p>\n<p>Bounce on enemies, dodge the hell of those crazy baddies and get new perks that can give you weapons and abilities to help you survive the later levels!</p>\n<p>CatJam is trying to restore the almighty Palette and protect the Blocky invasion. Each enemy defeated increases your palette aura, and taking a hit makes it smaller. Painting the world directly improves your abilities, such as explosion size for bombs and projectile count for snow flakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard: WASD to Move+ Left Click to Jump</li><li>Keyboard (Scheme 2): Arrow Keys + SpaceBar</li><li>GamePad: Left Stick or D-Pad to move, B or A to jump</li></ul>\n<p>I had a blast developing this one, and I hope you all like it. I had to scratch a lot of ideas but in the end I\u00a0was able to publish a rather complete version of the game. I missed the game jam deadline by a few minutes so this is a late submission. The whole game was made in less than 3 days, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>MabookFont, by khurasan</li><li>Everything else is my own.\u00a0Visuals, gameplay and design all made during the jam period.\u00a0</li><li>SFX and Music are my own as well, but not made specifically for this jam.</li><li>Developed using Unity + Licht (an opensource general-purpose C# library for game development, made by me)</li></ul><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p><ul><li>Count Catoola's curse allows you to go over your maximum health (oops!)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T19:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/049e0553a023b9688ff7f86c852a9173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thinker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
