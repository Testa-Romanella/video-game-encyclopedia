{"id": 953883, "slug": "demolition-3", "name": "Demolition!", "name_original": "Demolition!", "description": "<p>Submission to Shacknews Jam Spring 2023<br/>Theme: \"Retro\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Demolition!</strong> is a Minesweeper-inspired top down explosive puzzle game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Demolish your way through each floor of a skyscraper using a variety of explosives to reach higher levels. Avoid hitting the load-bearing walls or the floor will crumble and fall on top of you, resulting in a game over. Bombs hidden inside the walls can be a tool for bigger explosions, but they may hit nearby load-bearing walls if set off, so be careful. View your radar to see all load-bearing walls and hidden bombs, and mark walls to avoid while you destroy a path to the goal. Blow up tiles to increase your score, but reach the goal with extra bombs and get even more points. Includes an online leaderboard of high scores for all 5 floors!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: <br/></p>\n<p>Played with Mouse and Keyboard<br/></p>\n<ul><li>[WASD] to\u00a0Move</li><li>Hold [SPACE] to View Radar</li><li>Hold [SPACE] + [WASD] to Move Camera</li><li>[LMB] Toggle Flag on a mouse hovered wall</li><li>Hold [RMB] to Ready a Bomb</li><li>Hold [RMB] + [LMB] Place Bomb</li><li>[Q] Cycle Bomb Left</li><li>[E] Cycle Bomb Right</li><li>[F] Rotate Bomb (Dynamite/2nd bomb type only)</li><li>[R] Restart</li></ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Tips</strong>:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>At the start of a floor, view your radar by holding SPACE and look around using WASD to see all the hazards in the floor, and mark them by hovering over a wall and left clicking to place a flag that is visible outside of the radar <strong>and on the minimap</strong>.</li><li>Use your minimap in the bottom left to get a broad overview of the map and the location of the goal.</li><li>Quickly restart the level by pressing R or the restart button in the bottom right.</li><li>Bombs inside walls can be used to blow up even more tiles, but beware if they are near a load-bearing wall, as the chain explosion will hit them and bring the floor down, resulting in a game over. <strong>Bombs inside walls explode in a 4x4 area around the warning sign.<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Dynamite (the 2nd bomb type) can be rotated</strong> by pressing F, for a vertical 2x8 explosion or a horizontal 8x2 explosion.</li><li>TNT (the 3rd bomb type) explodes in a massive area for huge points, but beware of hitting load-bearing walls.</li><li>View your minimap or hold SPACE and use WASD to move the camera  if you need to view the area outside of your current vision.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Art - Nhoconic\r\n</li><li>Programming and Level Design - StealthNinja</li><li>\"Arcade Acadia\" song by Trevor Lentz</li><li>\u201cMINE-SWEEPER\u201d font by Gangetsha Lyx</li><li>\"DSEG\" font by keshikan</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d82ab1219c6ffbcc7834a608963f63e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StealthNinja"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
