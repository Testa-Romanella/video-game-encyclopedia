Use empathy, diplomacy and rationality to boost your own mind, weaken your opponent's, and build enough sanity to win.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Do you rush for early destruction of enemy's sanity?\r\n</li><li>Or play sanity boosting cards to protect yourself from harm?\r\n</li><li>Is resource generation your preferred strategy?\r\n</li><li>Do you play a lesser powerful card in order just because it's type matches the synergy star?\r\n</li><li>Or do you decide your mind's fate with each new turn?\r\n</li></ul>\n<em>Cards for sorrow, cards for pain</em>\n<p>Mind Jab features a deck of approx 100 cards, all unlocked, all unique, all original, all equally mad.
