Why? cause it\u2019s fun.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Space Radio is new but it\u2019s developing, it has eleven channels with different types of music you can listen to!\r\n</p>\n<p>All you have to do in this game is destroy everything you see on the screen that isn\u2019t your ship or your ball.\r\n</p>\n<p>A new ship? Destroy. An asteroid? Destroy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Guide the ball in it\u2019s path of destruction while avoiding those ships yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Screenshot your highscore and show to your friends.\r\n</p>\n<p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\r\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know how to save highscores yet or compete for highscores online. I\u2019ll add that to this game as soon as I learn that. Until then just the screenshot I guess.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also I just barely know anything about game development but I\u2019m still trying I\u2019ll improve the game as soon as I learn how to do so.\r\n</p>\n<p>Like I am aware of the fact that the music doesn\u2019t loops in the radio. You have to play it everytime the song ends. That\u2019s not a bug it\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t even get the radio to work without that. I\u2019ll try to fix that in the future. \r\n</p>\n<p>I mean I was just proud of being able to make a radio in the first place lol.\r\n</p>\n<p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*- <br/></p>\n<p>If I forgot to mention someone in the credits then that is completely just a mistake please contact me if I have forgotten your name in the credits.</p>\n<p>CREDITS: WOWIE JAM ,</p>\n<p>(https://jonas-tyroller.itch.io/wowie-pack)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T09:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cf9576b1a0adcf5abbe9161311493d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Hole"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
