Slash monsters with your sword, dodge enemies and projectiles by sliding, and jump over hazards. All actions give you coins but also increase the speed of the creepy monster that is chasing you! Sliding and jumping uses stamina, regular movement restores it.<br/></p>\n<p>Turned out to play like a simple parkour game, which is cool I guess.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/58787e959b32779d9618b904a3c68aef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["random.squid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
