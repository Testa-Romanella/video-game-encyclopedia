One of them is possibility to loop music from the middle (\"<em>seek</em>\" function). <strong>Don't be surprised if you will hear \"gap\" in the end of the main menu music</strong>. I cannot do anything with this issue as I'm not responsible for the tool porting \"<strong>Love2D</strong>\" to \"<strong>Emscripten</strong>\".
