It\u00a0lasts 60 seconds from start to finish.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai followed through on his plan to\u00a0kill Net Neutrality. Proponents of the move argued that paying more for faster Internet service was a good thing; Opponents felt that Internet traffic should be treated equally, ensuring that ISPs could not charge more money for different tiers of\u00a0service. Obviously, the move was great for giant corporations and terrible for consumers.</p>\n<p>86% of Americans think that Net Neutrality is a very good thing. Ajit Pai ignored public opinion and sought not to protect his fellow citizens, but to sell them out to large corporations. I am a supporter of Net Neutrality, so I viewed his decision to kill it unfavorably, but his blatant disregard for public opinion is far more outrageous. Ajit Pai is an unelected public official who is using his political clout\u00a0to further his personal financial gain.\u00a0I am extremely tired of corruption in American politics, so I made this ridiculous game to vent my frustrations.</p>\n<p>For more information, click the link below:</p>\n<p>https://www.battleforthenet.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/810f4160f5cdd4f2172baeaaa5dc11db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RandoCalrissian"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
