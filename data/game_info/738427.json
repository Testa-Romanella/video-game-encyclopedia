{"id": 738427, "slug": "tea-jump", "name": "Tea Jump", "name_original": "Tea Jump", "description": "<p>A lone teacup tumbles along shelves. It goes fast and slow and takes breaks on a journey about not falling for as long as possible.\u00a0This is an endless platformer, where speed boosts rely on having tea, and having tea relies on -- pausing for a moment. There's a metaphor for the gamer literature teachers out there.</p>\n<p>This is a tiny game to try out a tiny premise. No knowledge of tea is required, fortunately.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W or up-arrow -- jump\r\n</p>\n<p>A or left-arrow -- stop (to refill your teacup at a teapot)\r\n</p>\n<p>D or right-arrow -- go faster (only possible when you have tea)</p><p><strong>Some Ways of Playing:</strong><br/></p><p>It's possible to find places to take a break where you can\u00a0take your hands entirely off the keyboard. It's possible to pause on a shelf by holding down a key. It's possible to play the game entirely at one speed -- or you can use tea-fueled speed boosts. It's possible to post your high score in the comments and compare yourself to everyone else there. It's possible to ignore scores altogether. It's possible to drink only one cup of tea.</p>\n<p><strong>Made for\u00a0</strong><strong>Trijam #156 -- development time: 6 hours, teammembers:1</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:55:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/0020b530434eb65f082ab3d8085769a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["the_nope_slope"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
