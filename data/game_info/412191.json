(Work in progress)</p>\n<p>The story\u00a0is about a young mage that is tasked with stopping newly awakened\u00a0magic users, who's powers have gone out of control. All while trying to balance her own past and issues. (Haven't started on implementing the story yet however.)</p>\n<p>This first game will focus on her task to take down one of these mages. The goal is to have at least 2 enemy types, 1 dungeon, and 1 boss fight. Currently only the start of the two enemies are implemented, I still need to make the dungeon and boss fight.</p>\n<p>Currently working on this solo, as my first project ever. It is very early in development, so don't expect too much as of\u00a0yet.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Keyboard and Mouse:</p>\n<p>- WASD to move, W or Spacebar to jump</p>\n<p>- L Mouse button or Z to melee, R Mouse button or F to fireball</p>\n<p>- Shift to dodge, Q to heal, E to interact (only works on chests right now)</p>\n<p>Game-pad:</p>\n<p>- L Stick to move</p>\n<p>- A button to jump, B to dodge,\u00a0X to melee, Y to fireball</p>\n<p>- L trigger to heal, D-pad Up to interact (only works on chests right now)</p>\n\r\nComing Soon:\r\n<p>- Tutorial text pop-ups for controls.</p>\n<p>- Loading previous save\u00a0functionality, while in a level</p>\n<p>- The Settings menu</p>\n<p>- Save Points in the game (the campfires)</p>\n<p>- Dodge animation (It's a stick figure right now)</p>\n<p>- Add XP points tracker</p>\n<p>- Better enemy attack animations (or add them in the first place)</p>\n<p>- Enemy AI that isn't just Mario Goomba brains</p>\n<p>- Background tiles that are distinguishable from the foreground</p>\n<p>- The dungeon</p>\n<p>- The boss</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T04:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d970efa3839586fdf9ec20a00d16f1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dino"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
