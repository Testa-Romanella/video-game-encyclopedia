Three S Class patients have gone missing from the [Redacted] psychiatric facility. All evidence leads back to a house that seems abandoned, with no one there for years. For a long time, you stake out the house, seeing nothing move at all until one day, you go in at the dead of night, the horrors that lie within \u2013 or should I say below \u2013 this house will horrify you. (Probably)<br/><br/>This game is a first person horror game why you discover what's going on with missing persons and a corrupt scientist find items littered around to access locked doors and secret passages<br/><br/>On a real note, it's your average game with nothing new or innovative. I just wanted to create a game actually on Steam finish a project instead of starting new ones. So, if you'd like an below average indie horror title, here it is.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T07:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052d45dd54e6fd38c8bf7de7c29796a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Travel oblivion"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Travel oblivion"], "esrb_rating": null}
