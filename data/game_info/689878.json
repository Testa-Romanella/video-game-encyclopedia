Within a dictatorial world ruled by a singular overlord, the Pterosaurs fueled with violence and hatred for being suppressed by their land creature counterparts forge weapons to fight back against a cruel and corrupt government. Your goal is to avoid being caught by the Kronosaur Police Department and jailed behind bars: Use your weapons to make your way to the capital and assassinate the overlord using stealth and flight.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Three major core mechanics for this game idea include stealth, flight and weapon generation. In order for stealth, a flight cannot be used. In order for weapons to be used, flight and stealth are both inactive. And vice versa for stealth mechanics.\u00a0<br/>Using some minimalism to counter the control difficulty, the game shall be played much like a platform with some alternation.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Aesthetics:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game aesthetics are very minimalistic, as a 2D (not platformer) fighting game is set to a specific location. The movement of the player will be vertical, ascending the level through a city landscape up to the overlord capitol.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game flow:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game flow endurances use the following dynamic features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Submission<ul><li>A submissive game for continuous gameplay and challenging objectives.\r\n</li><li>The game is highly diverse in charisma and interactive features with basic controls.\r\n</li><li>The story applies meaning to the players' cause.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Fantasy<ul><li>Set in an alternate version of history\r\n</li><li>Dinosaur empires and kingdoms\r\n</li><li>Corrupt Governments ruled by Dictatorial dinosaur overlords\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Narrative<ul><li>A story setting human history in the shoes of dinosaurs\r\n</li><li>Your struggles for freedom and power over the corrupt.\r\n</li><li>Most wanted state criminal\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Challenge\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Police investigators\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Stealth avoidance of detection by cameras, police, guards and dinosaurs\r\n</li><li>Tunnels and other directions of travel\r\n</li><li>Vertical map\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game feel:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game feel is aligned with game dynamics and the enjoyment for player immersion and involvement. The inclusion of a story and history provide a means of cause for playing &amp; succeeding. It also reflects current real-world problems within states of poverty, oppression and corruption. The goal to topple over the government includes a storyline and story basis along with simple game mechanics to both allow players to choose paths of success/failure and provide a story to each interaction they have. It's a very typed based arcade game much like 'Sans Undertale' (Ref 1. Wiki), but with different sources of game feel and story.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T09:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/5212956edc290ea6ccd94a0464fa87bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Senpai Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
