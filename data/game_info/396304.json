Everything in the games is done by us. We are limited to Gdevelop 5 at the moment and we would appreciate help from the community so we can get better programs for game building.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you played the T-rex game on chrome you are gonna like this one. Jump across the dessert with 4 different dino skins and try to dodge obstacles that are RANDOMLY generated (every gameplay is different). If you survive long enough the running speed of the dino will increase, and it will do so as long as you are alive. Good luck to all!\ud83e\udd73\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9ce3bded3badbff7b9b6d6ac7872b6a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YakitoriGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
