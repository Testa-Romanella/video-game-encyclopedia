A vast land awaits your settlers and is ready to be colonized. Send your architects and builders to plan and construct a city. But also send your craftsmen, to cut some wood and to mine ore. Make sure your fields are on fertile grounds, to get all the food for your hungry subjects! Townsmen \u2013 A Kingdom Rebuilt hands the crown to you: Guide your people from their first steps in a small village to a massive medieval metropolis with thousands of inhabitants.<br />\nOvercome the challenges that lie ahead. Your citizens have various needs in order to stay happy. And you have to keep them happy, to keep the tax coins rolling which you need to build even more. Beware, as there are many things in the world that will disturb the happiness: Seasons will change the demand for certain goods \u2013 more water is needed during summer, more clothes in winter. Catastrophes may hit your prospering city, the plague, a large fire or an avalanche won\u2019t make anyone happy nor will a bandit attack!<br />\nA huge variety of houses to build and many different jobs for your subjects will keep you busy. The armory will produce weapons for your soldiers, to keep your citizens save from bandits. The bakery or the butcher\u2019s workshop will provide food, the monastery, the juice manufacture and the vineyard will bring the drinks \u2013 and everything can be bought at the marketplace! Make sure to have an eye on the daily routines of your people \u2013 besides jobs &amp; food, they also need a place for recreation like a park, houses to live and entertainment in the jousting grounds or the tavern!<br />\nEach of your deeds is meaningful: If you order your folks to build a house, if you send them to a new job \u2013 everything will reward you with experience points. This progression system will allow you to research techniques that for example increase the amount of taxes you get or make your watchtowers more efficient.
