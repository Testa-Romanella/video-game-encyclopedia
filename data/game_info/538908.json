It takes the old and simple mechanics of the 15 puzzle and adds a stopwatch to record how fast you complete it! you can also compare your time with your friends to see which of you can get the lowest time. Or, if speedrunning isn't your thing, you can also play the game casually and try practising to solve the puzzle. The game for now, unfortunately can only be played on PC and MacOS, but stay tuned to when we add Mobile support!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e05abf6867d6a5ec07576637d6b50c34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["IDRK Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
