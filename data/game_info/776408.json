Each step guides you naturally towards the solution.<br/><br/>This is the kind of game I've been trying to make my whole career \u2014 I'm amazed Jack and I discovered this design. We hope you like it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-31T16:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf792dfb74446e1a6f8605a67343f203.jpg", "website": "http://www.playknotwords.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zach Gage", "Jack Schlesinger"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zach Gage"], "esrb_rating": null}
