We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. We hope you&#39;ll support us during our early access journey as we quickly approach the full release currently planned in January.<br />\nJoin us in the community section to discuss the game with the team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T23:05:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f6afb12e0b90544012d6c24e40a2f80.jpg", "website": "https://www.delveinteractive.com/", "rating": 4.25, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 86, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Delve Interactive"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Delve Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
