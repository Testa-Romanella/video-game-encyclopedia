Although he's a little sad about being alone, by the end of the game\u00a0his friends help to highlight a quality about them that is more important than simply having a romantic partner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've always wanted to make a story game, but I've always held it off, and I thought that doing it for a Game Jam would be a great way to motivate myself to finally complete one. I did all of the art, and the music and the artists\u00a0are credited in the game if you'd like to use it for any of your own projects. Please keep in mind that this game took a week to make, and I didn't have time to add as many features as I'd like (for now)\u00a0and feel free to give feedback if you'd like.\u00a0</p><p>Really looking forward to building on this :)</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Lilaco \u2764</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c7655cf2469d811d3cc57155411017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lilaco"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
