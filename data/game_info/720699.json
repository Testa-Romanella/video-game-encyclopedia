Bash enemies into each other, or pick them up after staggering them to use as projectiles. Race against a countdown timer after triggering the exit switch.\u00a0 The game is Gachimuchi themed because we honestly do not have enough original gachi media.</p>\n<p>Features music by Dankmus:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/Dankmus</p>\n<p>Only windows and keyboard controls for now. The framework for the demo (start screen, ending etc.) were hastily built using glue, paperclips and every last drop of my cum.
