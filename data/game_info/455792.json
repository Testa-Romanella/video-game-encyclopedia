This game is I developed for the Weekly Game Jam, week 153. Following the theme, roll, I have given the character the ability to roll in full 360 degrees. <br/><br/>I have spent way too much time (as usual) working on the character controller itself. It is designed to emulate the feel of some popular adventure games like Tomb Raider, or Remnant. Highly over-developed for the poly-art I am using, but I really love how it all came together, and I hope you will too!<br/><br/>The game is rather short, as I spent too much time working on the character, by the time I finished the interactions and the trap setup I only really had time to make 1 trap. I figured rather than drawing it out a whole bunch, I would just setup a little demo to give an idea of what it could have been. Hope you enjoy my first fairly completed solo weekly jam game!<br/><br/>The game has a pixel filter to give it a nostalgic vibe, it works best at 1920x1080!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Left Alt - Roll<br/>E - Interact<br/><br/>Mouse - Look Around</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/080d2313f347fa8541d9481d947f8244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeepFriedOreo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
