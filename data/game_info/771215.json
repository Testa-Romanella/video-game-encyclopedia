{"id": 771215, "slug": "deepex", "name": "DeepEx", "name_original": "DeepEx", "description": "<p>Explore a mysterious region of the deep sea.\u00a0DeepEx was conceived and created\u00a0over a weekend, as part of\u00a0Game Dev Unlocked - Game Jam #4. The theme for this game jam was \"Underwater\". The intention\u00a0was to make a\u00a0<em>simple\u00a0</em><strong><em>simple</em></strong><strong> </strong>game over a weekend, using the assets I have available to me. The premise I came up with was a scavenger-hunt, in an interesting location, with fun and relaxing control. I think I met those primary goals! I would have liked to\u00a0include dialogue of the player character speaking with a DeepEx colleague, and I would have liked to had more treasures. Maybe one day I'll add those features, but for now I'm pleased with the result! If you feel it's worth pursuing this game further, please let me know!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>Keyboard/Mouse</strong>Move<br/>Left\u00a0Joystick or D-PadWASD or Cursor KeysSwim Up/DownY/X (north/east buttons)<br/>or Shoulder/TriggerC / Space <br/>or PgUp/PgDnJump / SinkA (south button)CtrlOpen ChestX (or west button)E or EnterSprint/FastPress Left JoystickShiftCamera/LookRight JoystickMouse or NumKeysPause / See ControlsStartEsc\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Developed by Jason Leaver.\u00a0(@HeyBishop on Twitter)<br/>Animations and Character Controller by Malbers Animations.
