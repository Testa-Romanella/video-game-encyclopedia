The concept is really simple: collect a maximum amount of shells, but crabs will try to catch yours so be careful. Also, stay in the camera range or game over. Your final score is the distance you travelled times the amount of shells collected.</p>\n<p>The game wasn't really playtested, so they are some bugs and it lacks some balancing at mid-late game stage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb53fe72834334d6e7f94372bab7a91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thibsworkshop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
