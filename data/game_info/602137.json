The key features this  game has to offer is online multiplayer and an AI that gets  progressively harder each time you beat it.\r\n </p>\n<p>The players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs  into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall  straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.  The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal,  vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. The first player  can always win by playing the right moves.\r\n </p>\n<p>For optimization purposes, this game was designed under an  event-driven architecture where no code is run in an Update() function.  So instead, only co-routines and C# delegates were used for example for  input detection and moving the objects around. <br/><br/><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Open the application on whichever operating system you are running on\r\n</li><li>Select <strong>Local Game</strong> button to play against the AI\r\n</li><li>Select <strong>Quick Game</strong> button to play against a random player on a different device (<strong>MUST ENTER IN USERNAME</strong>)\r\n</li><li>Select the black disc or white disc\r\n</li><li>Press Play Button\r\n</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Press Reset Button to play another round of Connect-4 after game has finished\r\n</li><li>Press Back Button to go back to start menu\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>On Windows, touch controls are activated by holding the left mouse button</li></ul>\r\nInstructionsTouch ControlsMove Disc to the Left Column<br/>Swipe Left<br/>Move Disc to the Right ColumnSwipe Right<br/>Drop Disc<br/>Swipe Down<br/>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>I created all of the 3D models in Blender (Black Disc, White Disc,  &amp; Game Board), including the pictures for the black &amp; white  disc.
