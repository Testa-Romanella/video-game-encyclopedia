Pressing \"right\" will progress the story when necessary.</p>\n<p>In the game you must memorize words which are set to the 4 directions, then execute them in the correct order.<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful not to speed too quickly through the dialogue/text because you may accidentally press and input and mess up your incantation.</p>\n<p>I just threw some words into google translate for the latin, so, apologies for incorrect/random sounding latin.</p>\n<p> After the first part of the game, the rest is just an extra bit stuck on, you don't need to finish it. In fact, the end has not exactly been tested, and will probably just loop back. For further instruction please consult the following reference video.<br/></p>\n<p>Multiple hacks were used to customize and augment the Bitsy Engine's functionality. Borksy (Made by AYolland, further referenced below) was utilized to add the following hacks:</p>\n<ul><li>Transparent Sprites (by Sean S. LeBlanc)</li><li>Javascript Dialog\u00a0(by Sean S. LeBlanc)</li></ul>\r\nAfterword\r\n<p>This was pretty rushed so there may be some bugs.</p><p>This game was made with only a single room but many many palettes. It was a neat challenge.<br/></p>\r\nReferences\r\n<p>Bitsy Game Engine by Adam Le Doux<br/></p>\n<p>Borksy by A.
