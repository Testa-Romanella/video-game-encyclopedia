You, the Elemental Wizard, battle against hordes of enemies trying to get to your Crystal, which is linked to your magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can protect your Crystal by buying towers with magic orbs. These orbs can shoot Elemental Magic, which damages the enemy. If two types of Elemental collide then they react to each other, creating unique effects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the enemies get to your Crystal then they deal damage to it, destroying a piece of it. When enough damage is done the Crystal is destroyed, resulting in a Game Over. If you survive against all waves of enemies then you Win.</p>\n<p>But don't forget the most important part, have fun!</p><p>PS: For the best experience, play on fullscreen or download one of the desktop versions.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming - Tristan Albers</p>\n<p>Art, Sound &amp; Programming - Wessel van Lit</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Johan Brodd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T13:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2688c2175e7ea49c3fdb3c3bae85bb15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Veleon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
