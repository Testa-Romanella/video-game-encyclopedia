{"id": 16856, "slug": "audiosurf", "name": "AudioSurf", "name_original": "AudioSurf", "description": "<p>Audiosurf is a puzzle rhythm game developed by Invisible Handlebar. </p>\n<p>Players control a levitating vehicle and race it down a multi-colored highway. The players have to collect colored blocks known as &quot;cars&quot; and form clusters of three or more blocks of the same color. Hot colors such as red or orange get the player more points than cold ones such as blue or purple. The more clusters formed - the more score the player gets. Players are also awarded different bonuses depending on how did they complete the race. Players are also awarded one of the medals: bronze, silver or gold based on the selected difficulty.</p>\n<p>Players are free to choose one of 14 different vehicles to use. Each vehicle belongs to one of the three difficulty groups and has unique abilities. Using different vehicles may change the gameplay drastically.</p>\n<p>The main feature of Audiosurf is the synchronization of the track, traffic pattern, and color with the song you choose. The song dynamics affect the track elevation (in case of a song build-up for example).</p>\n<p>On launch, the game featured the soundtrack from Valve&#39;s The Orange Box and songs from independent artists. Players can also choose any track saved on their PC.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2008-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f585fa72f534f62f9e5da051179f5de.jpg", "website": "http://www.audio-surf.com/", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 46, "owned": 2593, "beaten": 251, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 271, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 539, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 544, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dylan Fitterer"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
