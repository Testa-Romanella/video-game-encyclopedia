(Can you tell that graphics aren't my strong suit?)</p>\n<p>While your ship can dish out some serious damage, building up power the longer you shoot, you'll start to lose control as you fire! Therefore, you'll have to balance between offense and evasion carefully if you want to survive!</p>\n<p>Details on the scoring system and such can be found in the readme file included with the game. Have fun!</p>\n<p>(In case you're wondering, the name comes from how a lot of Eastern players refer to the shmup genre, \"STG\" or \"shooting game\".)<br/></p>\n<p>(Oh and by the way, I ran out of time to update the readme but Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen ok thanks &lt;3)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb447249e8c73344d203a06d76b5a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eye Candy Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
