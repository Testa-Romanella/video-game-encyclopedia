I need to get out and get some toilet paper!\"<br/><br/>Primary needs are difficult to come by in times of quarantine. People around are ignoring all safety measures and spreading infection, but you <em>really </em>need that toilet paper. Make your way to the super market while avoiding careless joggers, delicate grannies and overzealous cops.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the Supermarket, hall of the holy paper. You need to first get here and then come back home.</p>\n\n<p>This is a self certification of need. With it in your hands no cop will contest your hanging out! ...At least once. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.</p>\n<p><strong>Hazards</strong></p>\n\n<p>This careless granny seems like lost her way home. She stops from time to time to cough, most likely she just caught a cold. Better to not get too close, just to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Johnny Mercury here's on a run, you can't <em>stop him now</em>. He'll keep jogging around the neighborhood; try not to <em>bite </em>its... dust.</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Ci stiamo cagando sotto!\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>This friendly Italian cop is patrolling to make sure all good citizens are staying home. If he finds you outside he will send you home in a flash! Unless you can provide him with a self certification. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Final comments<br/></strong><br/>Project developed for the StayAtHome GameJam, as a light take on the current world situation.
