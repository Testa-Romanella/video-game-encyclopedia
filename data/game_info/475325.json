Up to date graphics and sounds make this game an experience on your PC today.<br/><br/>A ball jumps up and down and can be moved to the left and right. Every level has to be cleaned of all color blocks. This works only if the color of the ball and the block match though. Skill and brain power are needed to solve all 200 levels.<br/><br/>If you finished those, you can still find more sets in the online level database (\"Levelbase\").<br/><br/>And should you be able to finish all of them you can always start up the editor to build your own contraptions.<br/><br/>This version is built upon DirectX 8 and should therefore run on pretty much everything.</p>\n<p>Also available in the Windows store (link for now:\u00a0https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3NFTHWX0W3)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6744c7bf7f080aa2a90b4ea4547b353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endurion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
