{"id": 794568, "slug": "interplanetary-convenience", "name": "Interplanetary Convenience", "name_original": "Interplanetary Convenience", "description": "<p>This is a short game. In a playthrough, you will have 4 alien customers who each want a specific product. Your job is to decipher their alien languages and get them what they want.\u00a0The game has a storyline and a single ending. There is some slight horror in the game and one alien creature's language consists of one word: kill.</p>\n<p>There is randomization in this game: the 4 aliens are drawn at random from a pool of 8. The wants are also randomized, from a pool of 3 per alien.\u00a0I think this kind of randomization helps the game work as either a puzzle or a memory game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of the alien creatures in this game are unused characters I made for earlier games.</p>\n<p>This game was worked on from May 20 - May 28, 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cc/8ccabfb2ebfc95f70faed9ae741abcb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
