In this stealth game, you plat as <strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong>. Your goal is simple: collect slices of pie, hide from the wolves and get to Granma's house!</p>\n<p>Other than pie, you'll also find rocks lying on the ground. You can use them to distract the wolves, to stun them, and to scare away the birds that stand in your way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Shift</strong> to run</li><li><strong>Ctrl</strong> to sneak (currently useless)</li><li><strong>E</strong> to pick up</li><li><strong>Right mouse button</strong> to open the inventory</li><li><strong>Scroll wheel </strong>to select an item</li><li><strong>Q</strong> to drop\u00a0</li><li><strong>Hold Q</strong> to throw</li></ul>\n<p>As some of you already know, the game is still in a very bare bones stage, and that's how it's likely going to stay. It's not very polished and probably not very fun to play, but I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong!</p>\n<p>One major problem (that I hope to get fixed before DD starts) is the very wonky collision detection of the wolves in their attack animation. Some times they'll miss you even if you're standing completely still in front of them.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you'll have some sort of fun with this game, even if you don't make it to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits: </strong><em>Level design by Snekdev (who also helped a bit with the game design), Music by MuscularHair (the title menu song was made by Anon).</em><strong>\u00a0</strong>Thanks to them for the great help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec5277bc5dfe31f50e41441ec61e7856.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
