The game was inspired by my interest in eastern philosophy, and particularly\u00a0meditation. The idea of the game is to encourage a less selfish perspective on material possessions and prestige. This idea came from the common belief among eastern thinkers that limiting our attachment to material things and the ego is a path towards greater happiness and a more peaceful state of being. I came across a metaphor from Thich Nhat Hanh that describes us as thinking we are all individual and insignificant waves, when instead we should think of ourselves as the ocean itself, all one and the same \u2013 not separate. I thought this could make for a great visual metaphor and I wanted to explore this in my game so I set the game underwater and designed mechanics that would encourage detachment from material things in the game. This runs counter to most games in that they usually encourage players to accumulate items, wealth and power, so I think it will be interesting to explore what happens when I play with the player\u2019s expectations of how a game usually works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gamepad Supported</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls :</p>\n<p>Left Ctrl = Interact</p>\n<p>Space = PickUp</p>\n<p>ArrowKeys/WASD = Move</p>\n<p>This is a student game still in development so there will likely be bugs and problems so I apologize if anything goes wrong for you.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b29b32174f5719d104862d88926c0376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Clay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
