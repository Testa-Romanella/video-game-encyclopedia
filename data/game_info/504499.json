Ocean Commotion (Demo)", "description": "<p>We're making a course clear 3D platformer that largely takes place underwater, with the most distinctive gameplay aspect being that the player controls their gizmos with the right analog stick. The goal of each course will be capturing underwater sea creatures that are being controlled by a sinister artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>The demo we've made available for download has an extremely simplistic environment and somewhat simple platforming challenges. What we're hoping to accomplish by releasing this is two things: We would like to see if there's interest in us continuing the project, and we'd like to hear feedback on the base of our game before proceeding with the final project. This is why we ask that, if you do us the favor of playing the demo, that you be especially rigorous and intensive with any and all criticism. We would like to know any and all areas of weakness so that we can deliver the best possible game we can make.</p>\n<p>If you like the demo, we hope you'll follow our Twitter and our Instagram, of course any attention at all is very appreciated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bbe07033736b5443603d6f3258e4c83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Home Sick"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
