THIS TOOK OVER 4 HOURS OF WORK SO PLEASE ENJOY IT! (The demo is the placeholder until I release the game.)<br/><br/>Story: <br/>You get a job at the gas station as a janitor, and when your boss asks you to sweep for the night, something about the place seems a bit off.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Mouse to move broom, click and hold to sweep.<br/>Space to take customer requests.<br/>P to pause. (In-game only)<br/><br/>How to avoid the dinosaur:<br/><em>Hey, I wanted to let you know on how you can avoid the dinosaur, ok? When you hear footsteps the first time, stop sweeping and do not help the customer yet, then wait a little bit (the dinosaur stays for a while to make sure no one is in there) and then when you hear footsteps for the second time, that means he is leaving, and you can continue your work shift. - Your boss, Scratchy.<br/><br/></em>Report bugs/glitches:<br/>You can report any bugs or glitches in either the demo or the full game at slaughternicholas193@gmail.com. (I won't be fixing any bugs in the demo version because I will be focused on the full game)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T20:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07ffd76ee8f12da5b025da8321c5c4e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RealAnxiousPain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
