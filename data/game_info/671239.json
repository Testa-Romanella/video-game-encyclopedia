Here are some things I had trouble with:</p><p>When putting the crow in the cage: the status of the cage should be occupied and show the crow inside the cage\u00a0\u00a0instead of disappearing. I had trouble getting the 'occupied' state to work and even change the sprite index, but in the end what ended up working was to do a collision with the instance_destroy() function. I'm not a programmer so I had very basic knowledge of how to get this to work, so any constructive comments would help.
