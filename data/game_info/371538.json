They try to uncover the truth about the two major factions who are currently at war. During the game you will have multiple opportunities to decide which path Leo and his friends will take. Will they join forces with The Royal Army? Or with The Children of Twilight? \u00a0You must find out what role each plays in the war then decide for yourself which is more righteous. Who will become friend and who will become foe. \u00a0Be careful as your decision will alter the course and there is no going back.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Royal Army<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>Protectors of the realm.\u00a0 Saviors of the defenseless. \u00a0People say many good things about the Royal Army, so much good things it makes you wonder why no bad things are said. Our main character Leo finds himself hating that which protects his home.\u00a0 Ready to strike out against the first knight he sees, he starts his journey.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Children of Twilight<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>Unruly tricksters.\u00a0 Harbingers of the Void. Unlike The Royal Army, The Children of Twilight are mostly despised throughout the realm. \u00a0For what reason? \u00a0Do they wish to usher destruction to the world? \u00a0Or are they ostracized for their theory on how things played out thousands of years ago and not so bad of people?</p>\n<p>These truths will be uncovered as you go along your journey and meet with the people of Ephanor. \u00a0It will be evident early in your adventure that you must pick a side soon as the tensions are reaching a their climax. \u00a0With your help the tide can turn for either side. Which will you choose?</p>\r\nDemo\r\n<p>The game is currently in development. \u00a0This is about a 1 hour demo of the very beginning of the game. \u00a0Being that there is currently only one choice to be made at the end of the demo. \u00a0It currently does not effect the demo but will effect your destination in the next chapter.</p>\r\nChapter Releases\r\n<p>My current plan is to release the game in chunks or chapters. I hope to make each chapter 1-2 hours long. \u00a0I am not sure how many chapters there will be but my goal is to make a complete game with about 30-40 hours of game play.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Any feedback you can provide will be greatly appreciated. \u00a0There any many ways to leave feedback: comments, email me at talesofephanor@gmail.com, discord me at Renicon#9504.</p>\r\nBugs\r\n<p>If you encounter any major or game breaking bugs please report them to talesofephanor@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e694a9576e5ffa6755fa4f8901fc0287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Renicon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
