Shoot with the left mouse button.</p>\n<p>The theme is \"Lost in Space\", so decided to make a game about managing the space between you and the enemy. You heal by being close to the enemy, but you can only shoot when you're putting yourself in the open.</p>\n<p>The music was made by my brother for this game jam.</p>\n<p>The environment assets are from\u00a0Quixel Megascans, the worm model is from Turbosquid. Sounds from freesound, then edited with Reaper. Modeling and scene layout in\u00a0Blender.</p>\n<p>Made with my toy game engine. If you run into a bug or crash, please let me know and I'll fix it ASAP\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/6721c5aa944370038bad39c90349fca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sergioskybox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
