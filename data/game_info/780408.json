But instead of putting them on the shelf you...feed them...to weird box cat things...huh.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>They are hungry! Feed them! Before a timer runs out of course! Also as your running through the isles, you may be stopped by various minigames and or unknown cat demons who MAY or MAYYYYNOT....harm you...\r\n</p>\n\n<p>We Want YOU! Stocking! Our! Shelves!\r\n</p>\n<p>(In under 5 minutes...)\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a really really short game, it's totally possible to beat it in under 5 minutes if you're lucky. That being said, this is the first videogame I've made since I was a kid. I've always had a passion for this kind of thing, so any feedback at all would be super super helpful! I want to get better at this!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading this far if you did, and if you want to follow me you can either on this website or on my Twitter @BrightPrevail\u00a0</p>\n<p> Hope to see you in the future! Happy stocking!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:59:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf175a013827f0ce433417c7a2b31501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrightPrevail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
