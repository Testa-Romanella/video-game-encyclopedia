It has been made in 48 hours using a prototype codebase I had with Enet library and Unity, so please <strong>be kind</strong> and <strong>expect some bugs</strong>. I'm hosting an \"official\" server but you can host your own server if you want (instructions at the end).</p>\n<p>The game client is already set to connect to the <strong>official server</strong>. Just download, execute, enter a nickname and have fun. You should be able to see a list of online players and their current score on the right.</p>\n<p>Also, <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>, this is a party game so I recommend you <strong>invite some friends</strong> to play it together with you or else it's not going to be different from a regular minesweeper game because it won't have anybody to swap your game with. It's not a very popular game so probably there won't be anyone else online. :(<br/></p>\r\nTODOs\r\n<ul><li>The lib I used is not supported by WebGL, so I'll try to port it later too.
