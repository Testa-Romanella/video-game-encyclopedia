Some dialogue will change depending on how much energy you have, so be sure not to wear yourself too thin!</p>\r\ncome back at any time\r\n<p>Whenever you log on, a recap of what happened the last time you chatted will be available to you so you can pick back up from where you left off. This is our way of telling you that you can take this game at your own pace!</p>\n<p>Not everyone can sit down and sift through lots of text in one go, so be sure to prioritize yourself first.
