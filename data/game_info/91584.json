That means you are helping me test the high speed sword &amp; sorcery iron age brawling, the magic orbs and tombstone shields, the running and jumping and teleporting, the fire spells and flaming goo, the gigantic gears and spike pits, and the fire spitting goblin heads against each other. I've been taking this thing on tour for over six months now, and if you haven't played it yet click below for the trailer or a gameplay video.</p><p>Purchasing FIRST ACCESS gets you the multiplayer versus mode. Up to eight players, ten maps, more than twenty charaters, and over fifty items means nearly limitless ways to play. The game will eventually have an adventure mode for a single player (or two?), and that's what I'm working on *right now*. Support the project, get the multiplayer now, and the adventure mode demos before anyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTrailer Gameplay Video Twitter Instagram", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0adb0e6c623775193cd86fc4a016ea26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lunarsignals"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
