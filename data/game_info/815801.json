That's about it!</p>\n<p>This is the first prototype of a game I'm working on about being an alchemist living in a guildhouse. This prototype demonstrates a rough version of about half of the gameplay: making potions in your lab to serve the members of your community!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as Valence, a young half-orc who just moved to the capital city of your country to try and make it big. You specialize in alchemy, the crafting of potions to cure ailments and bestow effects upon people. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this! More to come (hopefully) in the coming months as I begin development on the other half of the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T08:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2c4f6ad71177e27a327899b4f9b3296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["realwinterbro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
