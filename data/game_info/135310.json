Your score improves if you keep more people alive and more fragile items intact. <br/></p>\n<p>The theme for this Ludum Dare Jam is <em>\"The more you have, the worse it is\"</em>, so I made the player able to carry all the babies at the same time if the player wishes, but each baby adds weight and makes every step and jump harder than the one before, so the player has to make plans on how to get those babies back to safety. <br/></p>\n<p>This game can be played with a keyboard, but a controller is highly recommended, since a lot of the jumps are difficult and get even harder the more babies you are carrying. There are double jumps, walljumps, throwing babies downwards give you a small air boost, you can throw and catch babies mid air, you can jump downwards too. <br/></p>\n<p><em>Music and sfx will be added in the post-jam version, along with tons of items, levels and gamemodes.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad </strong><em>(RECOMMENDED)</em><strong>:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Directional Pad:</strong> Movement.</li><li><strong>Y:</strong> Pick babies up, or if no baby is nearby to be picked up, drop or throw babies.</li><li><strong>A:</strong> Jump.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W, A, S, D:</strong> Movement.</li><li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Pick babies up (or if already carrying a baby, drop or throw babies).</li><li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Jump.</li><li><strong>R:</strong> Restart the game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/282e2978717b9037e417b9d25c708540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Killerkun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
