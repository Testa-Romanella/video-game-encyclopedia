You need to build four skills with effect\r\nblocks and fight your way through the dungeon. A successful run takes about\r\nfifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>The current version is 0.0.1. The game is playable but it lacks a lot of user\r\nfriendly features. Try to kill five Dummies in the dungeon for fun, die\r\na heroic death, or press Space to reload the game at any time. If you are bold\r\nand curious, edit Data/skillTemplate.xml to build your own skill. Please\r\nrefer to manual.md for more information. The manual is located at the same\r\nplace as AxeMan.exe. It is also available\r\non-line.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired from <em>Baba Is You</em>, <em>Into The Breach</em>, <em>Captain Forever\r\nRemix</em> and <em>Space Grunts</em>. The \u263cmasterful\u263c tileset, curses_vector, is created\r\nby DragonDePlatino for Dwarf\r\nFortress. The color\r\ntheme, One Dark Pro, is created by binaryify for Visual Studio\r\nCode.</p>\n<p>You might be interested in other games made by me.</p>\r\n\r\nKey Binding\r\n<p>Main mode:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys, hjkl: Move PC around.
