That's the thought you play as in the game the thing you want to remember when you can't sleep.</p>\n<p>Writing thoughts down in my notebook personally helps me with insomnia, and I wanted to share that knowledge with the world in my own weird way.</p><p>This is a 2-week project I made for my graduation as a multimedia animator. I made it my goal to develop a simple but visually strong game within 3 weeks and I'm proud of the end result and I hope you like it to.<br/></p>\n<p>more to the story here -\u00a0https://imgur.com/gallery/17KBwpV</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T06:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb89efcc047cc7aa835e0d4093b07dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nickmik"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
