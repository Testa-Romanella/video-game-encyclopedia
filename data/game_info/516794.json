Terraformers must do the hard work of establishing and changing the environment to make it more suitable to human habitation while avoiding the wrath of a living planet. Sometimes the planet helps, sometimes it hurts. With dozens of charts to create unique planets with unique abilities and personalities, Spark Ark Logs is the right game to slowly play through a science fiction saga of an unfolding human race as they struggle to find survival in a surprisingly animistic space.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:18:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cdb10b645206929d783b6b5c580d6aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mothermultiverse"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
