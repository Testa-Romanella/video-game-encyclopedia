Most of the doors can be interacted with, and the area behind the counter can be accessed via the entrance by the wall, which will open as you approach it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking this out and I would love to hear any\u00a0feedback or suggestions in the comments section below.</p>\n<p>Here's a little walkthrough video to whet your whistle -</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3bf37183ae667c243ec4bf54336d791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davedind"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
