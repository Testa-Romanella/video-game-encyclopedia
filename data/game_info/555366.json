It was\u00a0made\u00a0within 3.5 hours, and it was made\u00a0for the Trijam. The game idea was way too ambitious for a 3 hour jam, but I still\u00a0had fun trying to make it within the 3 hours, but I needed 30 minutest more to make it playable.</p>\n<p>All graphics, sound, and programming was made within the 3.5 hours.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you in the first part of the game, you need to follow the instruction on the paper. In the second part you can see if you succeed in following the instructions.</p>\n<p>I have now also made a after the jam version of the game. It's still a prototype, but it's much better and it shows the game\u00a0idea better. This version is of course not for the jams rating. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970281736a08c5fcebfedfa175fb8ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JK5000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
