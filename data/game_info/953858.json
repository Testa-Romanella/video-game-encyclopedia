Some phenomenal cosmic power has inflicted critical damage to your space station. All systems are down so you must manually prepare the escape pod to get off the space station before it\u2019s too late. Solve word puzzles to deduce the correct code to input into the terminal before launching the escape pod and getting off the ship.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p><em>WASD</em> to move</p>\n<p><em>Mouse </em>to look<br/></p>\n<p><em>Left-Click</em> to interact</p>\n<p><em>Right-Hold\u00a0</em>to shoot water<br/></p>\n<p><em>Esc</em> to quit</p>\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n \r\n<ol><li>What do you think of the puzzles?\u00a0Too\u00a0difficult\u00a0or\u00a0too\u00a0easy?</li><li>What types of puzzles would you like to see added?

Additionally, there will be more puzzles in the next iteration of the game (we are planning on including at least 3 puzzles in the final game). The level design was made very simple for this playtest but there will be more intricate puzzles and room design later on.</p>\n<p>The countdown timer for the launch button hasn't been implemented yet either but will be included in future versions of the game. Also, the fire extinguisher object was not added as an interactable object yet, so the player has access to the water at all times.</p><p>There are still some bugs with the game so let us know what you find.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T17:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/272fa6736e5b4140f29447d2a84737f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["awvz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
