That's a good idea. I'll check in with the botanical deck's senior supervisor sometime soon and see what I can do. They haven't been letting junior supervisors on the deck for the past few days though. I'm not sure what's going on. Maybe I can snoop around. I know more about their inventory than they do. If there's a problem, I can solve it.<br/></oliverg@stn32.net></dylman7@stn34.net></p><p>Station 34 will be making its yearly approach this Friday.
