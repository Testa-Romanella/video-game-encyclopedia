The theme was Awesome Per Second, the idea of removing all the filler from the experiences you create. My take on that is a JRPG without grinding or travel, just five encounters, each adding new mechanisms.</p>\n<p>I didn't think I was going to be able to get it done in time, but I did! It doesn't have any animations or sound, and there ARE a couple bugs left, but it's otherwise finished.</p>\n<p>Couple notes:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The circle that appears at the start of a character's turn is how far they can move AND still attack that turn. You can move anywhere on the screen, but if you leave the circle, you cannot attack. (There is a bug that places it incorrectly)</li><li>If you encounter a game-breaking bug, or get tired of a fight,\u00a0hold \"Q\" for five seconds to skip the current level.</li></ul>\n<p>Let me know what you think! I'll try to get a bug fix out by the end of the summer, but that is distressingly soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82be483b8a1e92e57902eddf97013922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["metalsnail"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
