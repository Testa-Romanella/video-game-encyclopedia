One day, some robot chickens go crazy and escape! Fay needs to find and repair them all before they explode!</p>\n<p>Control the player with cursor keys. This is a platformer, so you should be familiar with the gameplay :-)</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Ludum Dare 74. The topic was cooperation, so this game was developed together with @johannajaniszewski in a back and forth interaction, every day there was a small change made by one of us and then send to the other. The result is this game.<br/></p>\n<p>This game would not have been possible without the help of many others. First we would like to thank the MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Group for making Scratch, the platform we used to make the game.
