The goal of this project is to create something that feels like it belongs to the NES-era of action platformers.\u00a0There's just something so charming about the limited color palette, those lo-fi sound effects, and that old CRT display look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>The current objective is to make it to the end of each level however you can. There will be reward for risk and adventure.\u00a0 Attack enemies and obstacles with your sword, and avoid traps. Collect POW to increase your attack damage and the effectiveness of your abilities.\u00a0 Coins can be\u00a0spent at the shop (not currently implemented). Death resets the game (this will change as I add more levels and save points).</p>\n<p>Gameplay Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>You can use Drop Stab to destroy Skull Blocks and Vases.</li><li>With POW 5 you can break Skull Blocks instantly with a Drop Stab.</li><li>With POW 6 you won't take damage from spikes when landing a Drop Stab.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls: Requires Gamepad</p>\n<ul><li>Jump - Press 'A' , hold for high jump.</li><li>Wall Jump - Hold the DPad in the direction of the Wall and press 'A'.</li><li>Slash - Press 'X'.</li><li>Drop Stab - Hold Down on the DPad while in mid-air.</li><li>Movement - Left and Right on the DPad.</li><li>Dash - Left Bumper or Right Bumper.</li><li>Enable / Disable CRT Effect - 'P' Key.</li><li>Restart the game - Start + Select.</li><li>Skip to next/ previous room - Select + Left Trigger or Right Trigger</li><li>Exit Game -\u00a0Escape Key.</li></ul>\n<p>This is something I'll mess around with on the side but, as I find the time I'm going to try to make a real game out of this.\u00a0 I plan on adding bosses, more moving platforms, more enemy types, a shop to spend coins, new attack variants, and more environment pieces.</p>\n<p>~Crambles (Walter Pease)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/636bdff197dec91c59c870166845078a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crambles"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
