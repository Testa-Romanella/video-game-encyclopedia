{"id": 829095, "slug": "a-day-with-a-sick-phoenix", "name": "A Day With A Sick Phoenix", "name_original": "A Day With A Sick Phoenix", "description": "<p>You don't expect to find an injured parrot in the middle of the road.\r\n </p>\n<p>That's what happened to Modey, a retired metalworker who got lucky last year when he won the lottery. He shared his money with his friends and family; now his kindness will have to\u00a0extend to this talkative bird, who makes sure he gets what he wants. The parrots constant demands will chip away at Modey's good nature- how long until he's finally had enough? There's a plan already in motion from the moment the parrot enters Modey's home; he just needs to wait for the right time to strike.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>The street you live on has some interesting places. There's your next door neighbour who's terrified of wasps, and the butterfly collector with a beautiful garden of roses, and the grocery store that never runs out of milk past its expiry date... and then there's your local burger bar, who provide sick patients in the neighbouring medical centre with a lethal calorific meal. No-one speaks of the old woman who lives at the end of the street, though. That's because no-one ever sees her leave the giant mansion she owns. And you can't rely on your town bus service (because that got defunded years ago and you've never seen a single\u00a0bus since), but what you can rely on is a delicious pizza from Orangio's Pizzeria, making it just how you like it!</p>\n<p>This is a game created using RPG Maker 2003. It was built in 23 days for the IGMC: Rebirth contest. It's a dark comedy with some surreal elements reflecting my other much older RPG Maker game; Blind Quest II, which I made in 2009.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4cc1217161d2ca01a9d2a72943dfe66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colashark"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
