It is a game where you wake up with nothing but your clothes and 10 silver pieces. You go outside to buy a gun and head off into the newly found dungeon. In the dungeon you find vast amounts of unique and terrifying enemies that want you killed. You have to fight through the increasingly difficult dungeon to get as far down as possible grabbing any silver pieces and random loot you find. As you dive further the enemies get tougher until eventually you die, only to be re-spawned at your bed where you first started. There you will be able to spend your amassed silver to buy increasingly powerful and awesome weapons. Then you head back into the dungeon to repeat the cycle and dive deeper into the dungeon.</p><p>This project was for a national competition in Kentucky and not that the project is finished i'm deciding on if i want to continue the project or not.
