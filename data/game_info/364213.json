Like your favorite block craft game, but in the real world!<br/><br/>Tap to place one block, or hold and release to build an entire wall in one go! Build it small and then scale it up to walk around inside. Spin it around or zoom out to see the furthest corners, all without having to stand up from your seat! <br/><br/>Optimized for powerful control with single-handed use, build with precision using your own hand(s) with the expressiveness of augmented reality rather than dealing with difficult to master controls.<br/><br/>Over 60 blocks to choose from, and more to come!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T04:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1abf0dd73212b0066ac6ac297a64d4.jpg", "website": "http://voxbuilderar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Brian Oley"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brian Oley"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
