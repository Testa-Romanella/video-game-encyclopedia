Figured the quickest and best way to do so would be to break out (pun intended) one of the best beginner game programmer exercises - Breakout (or Arkanoid, or Alleyway or however you remember the basic ball and brick game).</p>\n<p>Basic Bustout has 5 different playfields that will loop through until you lose. Every 2,000 points you can get an extra life. Your high score is saved for you as well so you can beat your best plays. And for those who want to take a look at my inner thought processes, I've also provided the .YYZ project file for GMS2 so you can take a look at my madness.</p>\n<p>(note: please be aware that this was strictly a coding exercise to help me get to grips with GMS2 and the new IDE. As such, it's not exactly a polished piece and I'm aware that the collision detection isn't brilliant. But I consider this finished for\u00a0<em>what I intended it for</em>. Hence the inclusion of the project files in the downloads too - completely free of charge along with the art and sound assets).</p>\n<p>This has been released completely free of charge but if you like rooting about my code as well, please feel free to buy me a beer. Entirely up to you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b72b383e248765b413db499289b17a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alienatedyouth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
