In this case each floor is a new ship to explore. There's not much in the way of equipment, but there is an inventory, and some brewing that will be essentially for staying alive. Various monster types can be found as you delve deeper into the dungeon, each with their own sensory range and hit points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T05:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344af5e3a77c231c8ebfe8fa270946cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deathray"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
