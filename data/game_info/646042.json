Super Crate Box is a very enjoyable game - but have had a lot of problems getting it to work lately - including on Linux (which is my primary OS)\u00a0and Steam. So basically personally seeing such a lovely game getting lost slowly has motivated me to recreate a close to similar experience and grow it.</p>\n<p>So decided to replicate the experience in the\u00a0best way possible. And in a way that can be enjoyed on Mac, Windows and Linux. It may not exactly be at par with the original but I\u00a0guess it can get there some day.</p>\n<p><strong>Mega Craet Box</strong></p>\n<p>Mega Crate Box is built around very similar mechanisms as Super Crate Box. An explanation of the original game mechanics can be explained in this video:<br/></p>\n<p>High scores (leader-board) for this game can be found online at:\u00a0https://megacraetbox.vercel.app/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The Game uses both Keyboard as well as Controller Inputs.</p>\n<p><strong>Unlocking Weapons</strong></p><p>You need to constantly collect crates (regardless of the level score) to unlock the following weapons as the game progresses:</p>\n<ul><li>30 Crates: Dual Pistol.</li><li>60 Crates: Disk\u00a0Gun.</li><li> 90 Crates: Bazooka.</li><li> 120 Crates: Rocket Launcher.</li></ul><p>Note: This is the total number of crates during game play and not within a single level. So if you collect 10 crates 1st attempt, 10 crates second attempt, 10 crates 3rd attempt - you automatically then unlock the Dual Pistol - as you progress to then unlocking the next set of weapons.</p><p><strong>Constant Improvements</strong></p>\n<p>The Game will be constantly looking to improve over time - including adding extra game mechanics as well as Weapon Systems. Taking this a step at a time. This is being released as a Beta as for now. Its going to be exciting to see where this will lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting up our own Game Studio</strong></p>\n<p>We would love to improve the experience of this game as well as develop other game titles from scratch. We are looking to setup a Game Studio for this purpose - which is why we would love to have your support to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking forward to doing some amazing new game</strong></p>\n<p>We hope this will just be a beginning for more titles to come. Support us in our goals to come up with amazing originals in the months and years to come..</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>As usual had to make do with what I\u00a0would get my hands on:</p>\n<ul><li>Simple Dungeon Crawler 16x16 Pixel Art Asset Pack</li><li>Bows and Guns</li><li>m6x11\r\n</li><li>Fire Bullet 16x16</li><li>itty bitty gun pack</li><li>Kenney Assets</li><li>Murkje's 88 royalty free Retro SFX<br/>\n</li><li>Flaticon Game Controller</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30ed0783f061c17b7b1b04bf504eabbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ahmedmaawy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
