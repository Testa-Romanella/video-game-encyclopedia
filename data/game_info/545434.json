They stop the bunnies, but expend all their energy for the day simply holding them off until the next. (Why do you think cats nap all the time? They're exhausted!)</p>\n<p>Today, though, the tides turn in the cats' favor with the latest technology on offer.</p>\r\nEnter: <em>The Roomba</em>\n\n<p>With this dust-defeating droid, the cats don't need to lift a paw to protect their people! Finally, they can diligently defeat their fearsome foes!</p>\r\n\r\nRoomba Ruckus\r\n<p>is a single-player obstacle-littered race against time. You play a roomba-riding cat on a mission to capture all the devious dust bunnies in the house.</p>\n<p>Made in a week and a half for the OST Jam\u00a0of January 2021, a challenge produced by the same folks behind the\u00a02 Hour Album Challenge.
