This game is in very early stages and I haven't added anything but the building mechanic. This game will hopefully receive weekly updates.</p>\n<p>To quit the game, get past the tutorial and press the escape key. You can then press \"Quit Game\" to stop the application.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I'm only one developer. Feedback is appreciated, but I can't do everything and this is really only a side project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d4492e9dca9a3e20308bbf3f326132c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pug Lover Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
