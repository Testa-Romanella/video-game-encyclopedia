Use your antivirus software to blast the malware away, and be sure to not get hit yourself! This operating system game is still in development, much more will be added overtime. Try it out, and give some feedback! It would be very much appreciated.</p><p>This game is \"Name Your Price\" meaning you can pay whatever you want for it, or you can download it for free. Right now, the game is still in development, so only pay if you want to donate to the game! I encourage you to download it for free and try it before you even consider paying anything.</p><p>Don't Get a Virus requires a keyboard and mouse. You'll have a really tough time playing with a trackpad, trust me. The game basically works like an operating system. You control the antivirus window by dragging it around and pressing space to fire. You can change the wallpaper and game difficulty in the settings application. There are also some computer apps you can run, and some files to look at.</p><p>This game is being developed with the L\u00d6VE framework. https://love2d.org/ The assets were made in GIMP, Blender, and Audacity.</p><p>I'd appreciate any feedback you have! If you experience any crashes, please take a screenshot the blue crash screen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e90df13d15ba983f1f64884f7a59ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["1029chris"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
