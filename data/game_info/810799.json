They sure look like twins but they have unique behaviors. It's up to you to discover how to use their distinctiveness at your advantage.</p><em><em><em>Time loop and playback</em></em></em></em>\n<p><em><em>Each move you do with a character are recorded and will be played back while you're controlling the other character. It's like creating small time loops for each character.</em></em></p>\n<p><em><em><em>Beware, the playback is not the same for our two spirits: The day-one will rewind its actions and the night-one will replay its own actions.</em></em></em></p>\n\n<em><em><em>No pressure</em></em></em>\n<em><p><em><em>You can't lose and there is no time constraint in the game. If you make a mistake, navigate the timeline and go back in time !</em></em><br/></p><p>---</p></em>\n<p>Support the composer (Chris Logsdon) &amp; buy his music: https://chrislogsdon.bandcamp.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T07:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3eb450923d6fe867b5f8cdbee0ca0805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PandarooInteractive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
