But most importantly, will you be the first to reach the top or just one of the many who have lost everything along the way? (Currently only 35 floors are available).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:47:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d92bec1d5dc4e6549c3176ef7b4e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rastrojar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
