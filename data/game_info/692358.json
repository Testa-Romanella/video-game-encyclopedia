It took me a week to complete this project.\u00a0My goal for this project was to keep things simple: implement a working platformer game that is worth 10mins of fun</p>\n<p>I had the guidance of a tutorial to figure out how to\u00a0code a platformer game\u00a0but I ultimately tweaked the project in my personal vision as far as possible in terms of game feel and level designs</p>\n<p>All art and music are free assets I sourced together to fit my theme of an adventure in the clouds. However, I did create the pixel animations for the base character, goal flag and heart (life up)</p>\n<p>Did you guys enjoy the game? Did you beat the game? All comments are welcome to help me make better games in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T10:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/020/020c68fe7c5682a189d7ee11857189a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dragonTeaParty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
