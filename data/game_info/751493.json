My goal was to make a tiny but complete RPG, with a unique encounter system. I've made that sort of game in Pico-8 before,\u00a0and enjoyed it; so I had an idea of how to structure my week. <br/>I pulled together and adjusted the base code I wrote for a few other projects to get collision boxes, interactable boxes, and dialogue stuff while designing the first encounter, until I had a fully functional first encounter. That took a few days, then I spent the rest implementing and polishing for the most part, it went pretty well over all.</p>\n<p>My biggest regret is that the way the game is structured, it's kind of hard to pay attention to my sweet animations, it's an issue I caught too late. In the future I'll need to think a little bit more before I put\u00a0an encounter screen together. The game is also harder than it needs to be, but I guess that's something you learn through experience.<br/><br/><br/>The music was made in JummBox</p>\n<p>The sound effects were made with Sfxr</p>\n<p>The art was drawn in Aseprite</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my friends for some last minute play testing, and reminding me to tune down the difficulty so can be beaten by non-developer hands</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01c79b7618e8400752075ac00a4fd1ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Inkspinner"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
