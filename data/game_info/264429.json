He soon finds out the one responsible is not a scientist, hypnotist, or Hillary Clinton, but the mascot of\u00a0<em>Colby Jack's Pizzaria</em>! With the power of a magic helmet and friendship, Alex embarks on a quest to rid the town of Colby Jack's evil reign!</p>\n<p>This game was based on an earlier idea from 2007 that was sketched into a third grade journal of mine. It went under the name \"Skill Test\" and seemed to show an obstacle course directing Alex towards Chuck E Cheeses to stop some kind of evil plan or whatever. The appearance of the Commander Alex powerup and this \"Kelsey\" character were references to a very obscure public safety book written by my own mother. The book was called \"Commander Alex: Booster Seat Boy Warrior\", and I'll give you a cherry coke if you can find an online PDF of it. Another interesting tidbit is that my ex-girlfriend, Morgan, actually assisted in the level design.</p>\n<p>This game never actually got released ever. It was supposed to be released in 2014, but I decided not to because I was afraid people would be confused on why this game's so different from all the others and that people would get the timeline confused. What an idiot I was.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d77cfe9e09f1cb68575a1c9b2c1013e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["algamedev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
