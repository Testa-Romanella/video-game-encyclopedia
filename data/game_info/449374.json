There's nothing that gives me more pleasure than surveying a room full of shady looking eggs with hats and moustaches.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. I tried my best with the egg names, my personal favourite is \"Oliver Eggsarefreerange\".</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Music purchased for use from AudioNetwork.</p>\n<p>Hats, Moustaches and Ties purchased for use from VectorStock.</p>\n\n<p>Tim</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/959/959f3343f3a7d6ae9691259e5789cb2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
