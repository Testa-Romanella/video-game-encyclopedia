Once \n      you've gotten to know the crazy guy, it's time to change his appearance \n      in the Lab! Mess with his head and place seasonal accessories on him to \n      act as a hat, or change his look entirely with the painting module! When \n      you've made your raving Rabbid completely unique, you can take a photo \n      and send it in a Wii message to show your friends!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f8d582c86a13dc871aab13903cffbd6.jpg", "website": "http://rabbids.us.ubi.com/dashboard/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
