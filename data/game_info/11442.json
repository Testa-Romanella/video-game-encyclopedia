Use them to defeat the terrible henchmen of Cthulhu and rescue your girlfriend that was kidnapped.<br/><br/><strong>How does it play? </strong>The game is fast-paced and easy to learn, however, mastery requires foresight, improvisation and dexterity. In the deck building phase, you must analyse two options of cards and build a deck that has both synergy and specialization. In the combat phase, your cards are shuffled and only 3 cards will go to your hand. You then have to quickly improvise a combination to deal damage to the opponent, that can react and surprise you, forcing you to adapt to the circumstances.<br/><br/><strong>Where is the Roguelike part?</strong> When you are killed, you will have the opportunity to build a new deck. Enemies will re-organize in new groups for a new experience. But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t start from zero. Permanent rewards will help you progress in your quest.FEATURES<ul><li> Unique Card RPG gameplay based on spells;<br/></li><li> Build your own 6-cards deck using 27 of the 40 cards of Cthulhu;<br/></li><li> Learn to improvise new card combinations during a fight;<br/></li><li> Roguelike procedural generator for a new deck and groups of opponents each game;</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8fa517b2e4b51dc6f9990664c998dcac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.67, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 103, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Awoker Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awoker Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
