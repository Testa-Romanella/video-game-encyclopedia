Imagine a game that takes good old ASCII art and lends it a new dimension \u2014 literally. This is <em>Glittering Light 2</em>: a coffeebreak rogue-lite that blends tradition and modernity. A few highlights:\r\n \r\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>simple rules that allow for strategy without overwhelming the player;\r\n  </li><li>controlled with the arrows and three other keys, or the on-screen buttons;\r\n  </li><li>abstract, surreal premise that doesn't detract from the gameplay;\r\n  </li><li>colorful, richly decorated levels with a different layout every time;\r\n  </li><li>played in short bursts; option to replay the same game and get farther.</li></ul>\n<p>The game requires a modern web browser, such as Opera 58 or Palemoon 28; also tested on Android 5.1 with the latest FOSS Browser.\r\n \r\n </p>\n<p>As of 7 February 2020, music and sounds aren't yet in.\r\n \r\n </p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You can control the game with the on-screen buttons, or else the keyboard:\r\n \r\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>arrow keys or WASD to move;\r\n  </li><li>spacebar to attack / pick up items / interact;\r\n  </li><li>Enter to wait a turn;\r\n  </li><li>Escape to bring up the game menu;\r\n  </li><li>in the menu, both space and Enter select, while Escape exits.</li></ul>\n<p>Walking over items also picks them up.\r\n \r\n </p>\r\nHints\r\n<p>Apart from the in-game help, you might want to know a few things:\r\n \r\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The portal is always in the southwest corner of the level; you'll usually spawn somewhere close to it.\r\n  </li><li>It's best to first explore the area around the portal, but sometimes one last pile of glitter will be all the way in the opposite corner.\r\n  </li><li>Grace determines how many moves you get versus other denizens of the maze.\r\n  </li><li>Said denizens become weaker every time you attack them; if they're already right next to you, it's often better to fight than run.\r\n  </li><li>That said, their attacks also steal your available moves temporarily, and so slow you down.</li></ul>\n<p>The game doesn't have a last level; just go as far as you can every time. I can get to level 7 (give or take) on most playthroughs.\r\n \r\n </p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n<p><em>Glittering Light 2</em> uses the public domain Bedstead font by Ben Harris.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/fae212ce3fde84269b8bf8cb96118af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No Time To Play"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
