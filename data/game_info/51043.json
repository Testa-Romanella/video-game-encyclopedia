Players split into two teams. You can play as an infected robot, where your goal is to infect as many robots as you can, or you can play as an overseer to seek and find infected robots.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We will be adding more mods to a game. You can send us ideas and vote for existing once on Overlook website. Here are some of recent ideas: <br/><br/><br/>Defective robots applies infected pills for other robots. After few seconds pill deactivate infected robot. There is no \u201cfog of war\u201d in this mode and this came with some good and bad news for both teams!<br/><br/><br/>Infected robots automatically infecting others robots! Be careful \u2013 they can infect you back! Try to stay alive until all other robots are infected!<br/><br/><br/>Overseers\u2019s pointer blocks movement of a casual robots. Try to avoid detection by \u201cplaying dead\u201d when they move across you!<br/><br/>Defective robots need to pick up all alkaline batteries laying on the map. Overseer can detect if battery is picked using revealing area of their pointers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f17c88d4b42d2ce0262099c079e460.jpg", "website": "http://gametroleum.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gametroleum"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gametroleum"], "esrb_rating": null}
