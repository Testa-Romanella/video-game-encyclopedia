In Your Life My Payment, you need to save defenceless citizens against a creepy creature (maybe a little cute). You have a contract to work with the mayor of the city: for every soul saved, you make money. But if you fail the people of the city, you will have to pay a fine at the same price to the mayor.</p>\r\nCommands\r\n<p><strong>A, W, S, D</strong> or directional keys = Character movement</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> = Call a close citizen</p>\n<p><strong>Spacebar / Enter</strong> = Skip</p>\n<p><strong>ESC </strong>= Pause Menu</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>You should bring as many citizens as possible into the safe area (in red, at the centre of the map).
