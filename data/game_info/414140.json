When the game starts, you and a cop car spawn on opposite corners of the map. Use WASD or the arrow keys to drive your car. As the game progresses, more cops, coins, and exploding barrels will spawn. If you touch a cop or barrel, they you explode. Every second you are alive, you get 10 points, and by collecting a coin, you get a extra 100 points. You can buy cars using money you get from playing the game. For every 10 points in a game, you get 1 coin. Keyboard support only right now.</p>\n<p><strong>VERY EARLY Beta: Rumble!</strong></p>\n<p>In Rumble, 2-4 players try to survive barrels, collect coins, and shoot each other down over 4 rounds. Whoever scores the most points over the 4 rounds wins.
