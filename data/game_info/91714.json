You are sent on a mission to the planet Darx to extract the minerals we desperately need for our planetary defence shield.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDarx was not an uninhabited planet however. Your ship is detected on approach and an alien mothership dispatches forces that capture your vessel. You must use your wits, cunning and reflexes to avoid the aliens and escape from the 16 underground sectors of the planet Darx. You must avoid laser gates on the way and grab any floating pods that can enhance your firepower.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>** X-FORCE FEATURES **</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\u2022 Three full versions of X-FORCE!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\u2022 16 levels of blasting action!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\u2022 Slick in-game graphics!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\u2022 Includes \r\n\t<em>Crazy Hack</em> version of the game!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>** X-FORCE CREDITS **</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Richard Bayliss</strong> - Programming / Music / SFX<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>FeekZoid</strong> - Additional Music\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Saul Cross</strong> - Graphics\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Carl Mason</strong> - Loading Screen\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Vinny Mainolfi</strong> - Crazy Hack\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Dirk Schmitt</strong> - NTSC Fix\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Martin Pipe</strong>r - Disk / Tape Turbo Loader system\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Jason 'Kenz' Mackenzie</strong> - Game Packaging\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Oliver Frey</strong> - Inlay Artwork</p><p>\n<strong>** SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS *</strong>*<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>X-FORCE</strong> is a game for the Commodore 64.
