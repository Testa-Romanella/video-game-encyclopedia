But be careful, if you can\u2019t keep the rhythm the hamsters will wake up!\u00a0<br/>The more hamsters you manage to collect the more points you get when swinging in the correct tempo. Every point also grants you additional seconds to your timer so make sure you get those points!<br/>Also, watch out for those spiky objects, these\u00a0will also wake the Hamsters up</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong><br/>The game is based on\u00a0Downwell\u2019s dual purpose design.<br/>You swing the hammock both to keep the hamsters asleep but also to avoid objects and catch new hamsters. You do all this while trying to keep the hamsters you have inside of the hammock.<br/>Having more hamsters in the hammock makes the game more difficult but you also earn more points!<br/>Points are not only collected to get higher scores, but also to grant you more seconds playing.</p>\n<p>Hamster Hammock is a game made for Android smartphones created by Erik Friberg and Oscar Friberg for the\u00a0GMTK game jam.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits\r\n<br/></strong>Programming \u2013 Oscar Friberg<br/>\r\nGraphics / Sounds \u2013 Erik Friberg\r\n<br/>Music \u2013 Bike Rides \u00a0by The Green Orbs via\u00a0Youtube\u2019s Audio Library\r\n<br/>Game Engine \u2013\u00a0Unity<br/>Physics \u2013\u00a02d Soft Body by\u00a0Konstantin Saetsky<br/><br/>Swing that hammock!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/860838e1682cb9b57796ee998d69efaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["efriberg", "oscfri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
