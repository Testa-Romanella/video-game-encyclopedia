Through the methodology of reinforcement learning, these little robots can actually learn from their mistakes and make better decisions throughout the players progression in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Animo Lab</strong> is a <em>free-to-play</em> demo and a precursor to <strong>Animo</strong> which will be releasing later next year.\u00a0 The full version will include a highly emotive journey where robots can be trained to revitalize\u00a0and rebuild desolate wastelands into lush habitable environments. Share and trade trained robots with friends and construct environments unique to your robots\u2019 strengths. With multiple robots to choose from, and many different ways to train them, will your robots have what it takes to change the <strong>Animo</strong> world for the better? By teaming creativity with these budding intelligent actors, the possibilities are endless!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Animo Lab</strong> is ideal for...\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>People who want to learn more about Reinforcement Learning and modern A.I.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Educators, parents, researchers and students who are looking for a fun and easy way to make Reinforcement Learning more digestible for kids.\r\n</li><li>Creative and technical minds that enjoy solving problems while also having fun\u00a0in the process</li><li>People who like\u00a0intelligent robots\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em>Note<strong>: </strong>The game\u00a0uses\u00a0your computer to train real A.I. neural networks. As a result, you may hear your computer fans spin-up faster than usual. Don't be alarmed as this is completely normal. The performance of your computer will determine how quickly\u00a0your robots can learn. Happy training!\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6607f985939849b6cb84efded49c131e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["transformsai"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
