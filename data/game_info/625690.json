We've all wanted to confront the limits of our sanity via dropping into a savage arena where grotesque displays of cannibalism and regurgitation are not only encouraged, but vital to claiming victory. We've all daydreamed of clambering over towering corpse piles of unworthy foes, fuzzy bunnies, and bougie bankers. It is our unspoken but commonly shared aspiration to gaze into the recently deceased open eyes of our own previous incarnations, before consuming said corporeal familiars to fuel nefarious future acts. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd lo, the efforts of humankind have been squandered into misguided deeds such as \u201cmoon landings\u201d and \u201cdisease eradication\u201d, and thus no such sublime arena yet exists. Attempting to fill this void, Epic Banana Games offers humanity a crude facsimile, a digital simulacrum mimicking the raw emotional intensity that such a glorious arena will elicit (once it inevitably exists).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAccumulate the most wealth. Survive the longest \u2013 or become a petulant ghost to torment your rivals. Utilize arcane ingestion techniques to imbue your vomit with flame and ice, spreading chaos and destruction in your wake. But beware: as brutal as your competitors strive to be, you may find the arena itself to offer the most potent dangers. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo venture forth and decimate, decapitate, and masticate your way to victory in such manner that, upon witnessing, the ancient gladiators of yore could only remark \u201cForsooth! Mine best bloody efforts are sullied as puerile amateurism in witness of these decadent, depraved deeds!\u201d. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe arena awaits!  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSubjoinder: As a matter of course, an uncouth parading of Epic Banana Games' bona fides: <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The uncontested pioneer of the \u201cyogurt commercial simulation\u201d genre, with the recently released \u201cYogurt Commercial 3\u201d poised to redefine the fermented-dairy-food-advertising-puzzle-adventure game space. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Lost to time, the developers of the influential \u201cA Day At Work\u201d series \u2013 following protagonist Tom as he confronts the existential choice of pursuing mundane office work, or dismantling his environment in whatever means he finds suitable. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Originators of the \u201ccasual mosh pit simulation\u201d genre with \u201cMoshing Melvin\u201d a brutal fight-dance experience that attempted to recreate the pandemonium of a live mosh pit.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Creators of DataJack, a faithful adherent to the indie isometric cyberpunk stealth action RPG realm of games \u2013 continuously underrepresented to this day.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T02:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d88/d88177715dc1b427dd7941f55a02f613.jpg", "website": "http://www.reginalddoeshisthang.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Epic Banana Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Epic Banana Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
