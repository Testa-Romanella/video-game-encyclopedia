This isn't finished and is 7 weeks' worth of progress/commitment from bringing\u00a0this game up from an idea I had a few months ago to the start of a fun and enjoyable game even though it doesn't have the best of art and models. There is currently only 1 dungeon however I have plans to add more. With this game being a solo project I wanted to challenge myself to see how much I could learn when making my first game. This is entirely my own work other than the few assets I added in recently to make the game look a little better are the trees and little house in the hub.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click - Attack/Confirm</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause/Resume Game</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - Forward, Left, Back, Right</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>There is an option to use two unique weapons which have different benefits being range and damage.</p>\n<p>This game is still in progress and will have many bugs/issues, some known however there may be more found after testing. I have plans to add more levels to the game, styles of enemies, and\u00a0unique abilities. With this being my first game I am very happy with the outcome so far and hope to improve this more, learning new skills along the way.</p><p>Feel free to check out the models I made myself on my Sketchfab: :D <https: alfie2021=\"\" sketchfab.com=\"\"></https:></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/93536f3d3f5e0b3b24943f3f9c0853ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alfie2021"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
