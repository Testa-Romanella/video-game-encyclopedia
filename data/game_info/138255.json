It's rough around the edges, but I still find it fun. I may remake it one day!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>BlipBloop is a 1v1 asymmetrical local battle multiplayer game. One player controls Blip, a small green character who platforms around the arena, trying to reach the top to kill the other player, controlling Bloop. Bloop moves at the top of the screen and can drop blocks and mines down to impede and crush Blip. After a few rounds, players switch sides. Players get awarded with special bonus points for certain types of kills and actions at the end of each round.<br/><br/>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/357df96752d118b21c2d986c16091c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GetColorGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
