You need\u00a0a sense of humor when you and your friends* are sitting around shaking a liquid-filled piece of plastic hoping it will tell you that the\u00a0imaginary person you've probably grown a little attached to will survive whatever you got them into because it's fun!**\u00a0</p>\n<p>MMBBTRPG is simple and designed to get a game going in only a few minutes! Pick it up and start playing!*** There's guidance on how to run a game, and there are some tables you can use to build a plot mad lib style. You can even set up the brochure as a tiny GM screen since most of the player rules are on one side while the rules for running the game are on the other.\u00a0While you can use any genre, the game works best when you channel your inner Lovecraft (<em>Call of Cthulhu </em>and\u00a0<em>The Color Out of Space</em>)\u00a0and mash it together with a hearty helping of Edgar Wright\u00a0(<em>Hot Fuzz\u00a0</em>and<em> Shaun of the Dead</em>).</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>*<em>Not necessary for playing but it does make it easier</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>**<em>If you are </em><em>fortune-telling billiard ball deficient, do not fret! You\u00a0can play just as easily as your future-seeing-billiard-ball-having acquaintances by\u00a0</em><em>using 2 six-sided dice!</em></p>\n<p>***<em>You should probably read it through once before you play it, but I can't stop you if you want to wing it.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816308a4b528ea251786647e64b5e20e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Madison"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
