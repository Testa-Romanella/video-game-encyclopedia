To flip the screen, you can use \"Right\" to make a clockwise turn and \"Left\" to the counterclockwise. Jumping is \"Z\", \"Space\" or \"Up\", any of them, and let you perform only a straight up jump. The game was design with 4 levels that can be completed by getting to the flashing teleporter on each of them. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Special considerations</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All the content used on the game was made by our team, composed by an artist, a game designer and a programmer and we'd like to thank for all the viewers that got here to appreciate our job!
