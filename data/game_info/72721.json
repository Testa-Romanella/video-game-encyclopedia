A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. <br/><br/>It\u2019s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It\u2019s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. <br/>____________________________________ <br/><br/>\u2022Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Chinese <br/><br/>SUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ <br/>VISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   <br/>FOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T16:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b04626e13596bc564234a3cec1c0c2.jpg", "website": "http://www.maplemedia.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Maple Media Holdings", "Maple Media"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Maple Media Holdings"], "esrb_rating": null}
