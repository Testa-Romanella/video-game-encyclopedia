The tachyon drive has malfunctioned, and you\u2019ll need to find  an alternative source of power. There have been some strange readings  coming from this planet, and they\u2019re making your defunct teleporter  light up. Perhaps it\u2019s not the useless piece of junk you were led to  believe. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay/Controls: Use WASD/Arrow Keys to move Hold Z and X (for approx 1 second) to use your abilities (GUI elements on top of page show when they\u2019re available) Press F to interact with the (one) NPC when the prompt on the bottom of the screen appears. If you manage to get outside the bounds of the world you\u2019ll have to restart. We tried our best, sorry!\r\n</p>\n<p>If  you mysteriously end up back in the center of town it\u2019s because you\u2019ve  ended up somewhere dangerous (e.g., the middle of a river).\r\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>!!! HINTS !!!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>There are two puzzles to solve, each ends when you reach one of the crystals\r\n</li><li>Try to find the big crystal first, it\u2019s giving off some strange readings\r\n</li><li>You must touch the small crystal before you can touch the big crystal\r\n</li><li>If you get suck (after seeing the big crystal), hold x for about two seconds. The UI element may not appear at first\u2026\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Full walkthrough available with the source : https://github.com/LogJams/LD48/tree/main#readme<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11afbc30168a43d7d5005746ff4fbb6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Logiant"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
