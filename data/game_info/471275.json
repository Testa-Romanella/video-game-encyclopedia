I wanted to go for the jam's theme (\"Change\"), so my main idea was a letter, from the \"Destin\" which is the destiny. This game has more finals, There are few endings., a letter with a small \"motivational message\" :))) and some little aesthetics things. You know you achieved an ending when you are\u00a0 moved in main menu. I could make MORE things to make this a full game but you know.. no time, and i rushed everything to join this contest. Enjoy my game.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee0f1a4d52389777bb9fe0842d54f125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bot2229"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
