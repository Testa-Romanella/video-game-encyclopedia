We present our first collaboration work as titled above.. We are somehow very interested participating in NanoReno 2019, so we try to make a simple Visual Novel that goes well with our little time. We want to challenge ourselves to make something that won't be left out. Our style of visual novel that we make is a romance that will revolve around 1 location but everything will happen there. Hope you all enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Yuuma Satohisa had to take make-up classes because he neglected his study in the summer vacation.
