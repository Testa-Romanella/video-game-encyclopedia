The unique part of this game is that all of the familiar characters in the DinerTown universe are in their younger versions.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s original gameplay has been altered slightly to keep the player on their toes. For example while Flo&#39;s placed a food item onto the stove, she must remember to flip it or else the food will not be cooked to perfection. Unike previous games, customers no longer gain a heart bonus for speedy delivery. Seating arrangements are a bit different as well, for customers are now seated in tables instead of a single bar counter. This game introduces the &quot;Dash-thru&quot;, where customers will order from a window. Endless Shift is absent from this installment, replaced by &quot;Expert Mode&quot;. As the title says, this mode includes harder versions of previous levels that have been completed. There are also a total of four minigames that can be played after each completed level of a stage.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - Cooking Dash Wiki; &#39;Cooking Dash 3: Thrills &amp; Spills&#39;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T02:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33d8d24ff8f7cc5738ce4f92ad11af9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["PlayFirst"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
