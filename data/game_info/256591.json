As it was a backyard with trees and ground for me it was as if it were a forest in which I did my explorations. I used to hang out playing or watching my brother play video games. One day my father told me to go to spend the day on the beach, at that time I was very careless and playing at the edge of the rocks I fell and hurt my leg preventing me from reach the surface, luckily my father could get me out, leaving me the memory of how I almost drowned at the beach.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41c9fed6529941b9a4accc8a074eaa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whiestar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
