You are an excellent player in front of the screen and have played many excellent games. However, for this game, as it is the first time for the developer to develop a project, it is inevitable that there are many deficiencies. I hope you can understand. Getting your understanding and support on the screen is the most valuable experience for me. Thank you!<br/><br/><strong><h3>What kind of game is it?</h3></strong><br/>This is a third person action shooter game. Support for custom character size, support for costume change, use guns and bows for long-distance combat, can also use cold weapons for melee combat, with some training elements. Enemies include monsters and humans, as well as AI teammates.<br/><br/><strong><h3>What is the setting of the game?</h3></strong><br/>An unknown virus has infected the world. Most countries in the world have been hit by the virus. Many people have been displaced. After infection, some patients will become manic and aggressive, which makes the transmission speed of the virus faster and faster. Many organizations and institutions have united to concentrate their efforts to fight against the attack of the virus, but due to the rapid spread of the virus, some organizations and organizations have collapsed. The heroine's husband is part of a group working on a cure for the virus, but because the virus is growing so fast, the group must move to a safe area so that work on a cure can continue. Before the vaccine development organization moved the research site, each team member was allowed to bring a family member with them. Because the heroine and her husband had a daughter, so they decided to take her daughter Anne to the organization, so the couple decided to let her husband take her daughter first to the safe place of the organization.<br/><br/>The heroine and her daughter Annie said, \"Let's play a game. You and your father first find a safe place to hide from the monster, and then let your mother find you. If your mother finds you and finds you very safe, then you have won the game.<br/>Father and daughter left in a transport plane. The heroine had to walk to the new, uninfected area like the other survivors. But before she reaches her destination, she loses contact with the research organization and her husband and daughter. When she arrived at the institute's new location, she found that the research organization had been overrun by infected patients. After losing contact with her husband and daughter, the heroine is left to survive in this post-apocalyptic environment on her own.<br/><br/>Three years later, the heroine heard the news. Rumor has it that the vaccine research organization has not been completely dismantled, and that they are still working on a cure for the virus. It's just been hidden for a while to be safe. There is also talk of the research group taking survivors in a nearby city, but they will leave after a month for a new safe zone. The heroine believes that if this information is true, then she must get to the location of the research organization and find her family before it leaves. So the heroine begins her journey.<br/><strong><h3>How is the game played?</h3></strong><br/>Step 1 Explore<br/>During the course of the game, there will be day count, and players need to reach the most marginal city within a month after the game starts.
