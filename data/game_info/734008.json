The balance of these two grows less and less with the creation of newer technologies, more forests are being destroyed, more wildlife is suffering and it is your duty to stop this by restoring the balance between nature and machine. Use your powers of the forest to create turrets to fend off any machine that would harm the life tree of the forest, maybe even use that same tech against them!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Project Lead - Samantha Monaghan\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming Lead - Josh Davidson\r\n</p>\n<p>Art Lead - Aaron Lynch\r\n</p>\n<p>UI/UX Lead - Luke Shingleton\r\n</p>\n<p>Level Design Lead - John Houston\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset Development Team - Karl Redfern and Filip Taranek\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming Team - Holly Boyle and Turlough Doherty\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Jakub W - Grass and Dirt Asset Materials\r\n</p>\n<p>UDebLemon - Modular Low Poly Robots Asset Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Dunegon Mason - Wizard for Battle PolyArt Asset Pack - Animations only\r\n</p>\n<p>Lous visual effects - Luos's 8 Elements\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/201/20144ec94ad1ec235c23a5bbb402cc16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoshDavidsonDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
