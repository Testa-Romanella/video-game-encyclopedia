Your life's goal is to collect Crates while at the same time, evade enemies that are constantly on your tail, trying to destroy you. These enemies come in a couple of flavors, the Particle and the Barrier being the most common ones.<br/><br/>By collecting Crates, your score goes up. The higher your score, the cooler you look. In addition, your score goes into a global Steam leaderboard in which you compete with all the other players. You also collect achievements.<br/><br/>There's also a mobile version of this game, available for Android and iOS. It follows the same logic. It's currently available directly in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T03:41:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5d/a5d86700c9ff3d3963621fb6ec410356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ongakken s. r. o."], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Ongakken s. r. o."], "esrb_rating": null}
