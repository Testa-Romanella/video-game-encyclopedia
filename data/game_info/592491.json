Your job is to avoid colliding with the monoliths by figuring out the manner in which they move. You are given 9 lanes in space in between which you can move your ship. When traveling through space the speed of the ship increases which makes it difficult for you to avoid the monoliths. The speed\u00a0is shown on your screen. You also need to pick fuels on your journey through the space to keep moving. Once you run out of fuel or collide with a monolith, it's game over for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efc15e569c7d09aefc0c37fc7e7c4068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarthak Mishra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
