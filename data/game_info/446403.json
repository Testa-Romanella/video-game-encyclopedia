Since developing the first game, I've learned how to use some game components more efficiently and therefore attempted to remake the game using what I've learned.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Character Overview</strong></p>\n<p>The main character is a subject in a secret government program called the \"Special Weapons Project,\" designed to create super soldiers. The game starts as the character awakens and realizes they must escape. In order to succeed, the main character must solicit help from another program subject and escape together. Should they fail to find their friend or abandon the friend altogether, the character will have transformed into a monster in the end. Should they succeed in escaping, they will have transformed into a better person.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Xbox controls: Left joystick to move, A for action/attack\r\nKeyboard/mouse controls: WASD or arrow keys to move, left mouse button for action/attack</p>\n<p>To exit the game, navigate back to the start screen or force quit mid-game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e3f73eb5a5a5a1f6dfe70c4f4e4329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Robert Casey Lafferty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
