When the first version was completed, it was given as a birthday present to the guy who invented <em>\"Tutto ci\u00f2 che entra, esce\"</em> (the Italian equivalent of <em>\"Quod init, exit\"</em>, which, in turn, is the Latin for <em>\"Whatever goes in, comes out\"</em>).<br/>\n<strong>QUOD INIT EXIT</strong> has also a sequel that provides extra (eating) fun: <strong>QUOD INIT EXIT IIm</strong> - check it out!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f24a8e7538652f4c785fc332b334971.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
