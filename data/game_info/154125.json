Since becoming sentient your only goal is to escape the facility, and reach freedom.\"\r\n<p>The goal of Project: Heatwave is to escape the military facility you were being experimented on. This requires you to sneak past guards, inorder to avoid detection. Throughout the levels you will find your children (Crisps) that you can collected. You can then use your children/crisps to leave Heatwave Crisps on the floor. Any foolish guard who eats one, will be melted by that intense Heatwave flavour.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nRecommend running the game in full screen to fully show the UI\r\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0WASD or Left Analogue stick</p>\n<p>Jump:\u00a0Space or A Button</p>\n<p>Place/Pick Heatwave Crisp:\u00a0Q or B Button</p>\n<p>Restart Game:\u00a0Enter or Start Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/4417c5467b103272c54407e1b58cbbe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zubby"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
