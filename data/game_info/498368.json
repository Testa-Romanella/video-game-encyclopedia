Found?!\r\nHow to play:\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Jump: [SPACEBAR]<br/>Change direction: [K]</p>\r\nInstalling:\r\n<p>Install the <em>unpacked\u00a0chrome extension</em>\u00a0\u00a0to have the game start up when you get a <strong>404</strong> error (yeah it can be a little annoying but it opens up in a new tab and you can simply close that). You can always deactivate the chrome extension later lol.</p>\r\nInstall instructions:\r\n<p>Decompress the zip file that comes with the download. Inside of it there should be a \"<em>manifest.json</em>\" and a \"<em>background.js</em>\" files.<br/>To install the chrome extension you need to open chrome and in the OmniBox (url input bar) type \"chrome://extensions\". Enable developer mode and click the \"Load Unpacked Extension\" button. You will be asked to select a folder: select the one with the \"<em>manifest.json</em>\" and \"<em>background.js</em>\" files that was originally compressed.</p>\r\nMotive:\r\n<p>This little game was made in 6:44 hours (<strong>404</strong> minutes) along with a <strong>Google Chrome </strong>extension that loads the game's page whenever a web server responds with a <strong>404</strong> Error (page not found). It was a way of celebrating 400+ (<strong>404</strong>) subscribers to my YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>I kind of overestimated how short would <strong>404</strong> minutes be: this was my first time making a game in so short of a time limit and, looking back, I could have probably went for something a bit more complex. Yet, I am happy with it and it makes for a reasonable small web game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a046892ef5f9bd66cb10657cbc751b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PunkPebbleStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
