Well now it's here. Crappy Birds! is a new game where you can tap to crap. You will have 20 seconds to crap on as many people, objects or whatever as you can. <br/><br/>When you go to start a new game it will load the profile pictures of 8 random Facebook friends who have authorised the Crappy Birds! app, you can then choose to continue or click on a target to add from the photo library or take a picture.<br/><br/>Want to get even crappier? Well there are boosts that will allow you to have up to 5 craps on screen at a time or get an extra 10 seconds.<br/><br/>You can even share your final score on Facebook to let people know how many times you crapped on them. Crap on them before they can crap on you...<br/><br/>Let's get crappin'!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/054f1104694c16b40dc5b1007c79e7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Chelsea Farley"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Chelsea Farley"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
