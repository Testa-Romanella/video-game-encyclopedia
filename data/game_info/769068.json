Are you wanting fast food, but all of the delivery sailors are on strike? Did a magic ring wash up ashore, and while you worried it was evil, it specifically TOLD YOU that it's not evil, so you wanna go find even more magical bling-bling? Let's do this thing!</p>\n<p>Players, along with an AG (Adventure Guide, my own jazzy term for \"Dungeon Master\"), will embark on an adventure together, trying to complete their objective and learning about themselves and each other along the way. You'll all have to work together, encouraging each other, putting your strengths to good use while turning your negative traits into positives if you want to succeed. But don't worry!\u00a0This is a chill, laid-back game where death is impossible and limits pre-game are set in stone.</p>\n<p><em>It's Dangerous to Go...But Let's Go Anyway!\u00a0</em>uses the 3d6D system created by Laura/Munchie of Lucky Newt Games.
