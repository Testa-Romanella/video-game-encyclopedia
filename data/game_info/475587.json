{"id": 475587, "slug": "retro-rampage", "name": "Retro Rampage", "name_original": "Retro Rampage", "description": "<p>A top down shooter with rogue-like elements. 1-bit (ish) artstyle. Made in 48 hours \u00a0for the 2020 GMTK game jam. The theme for the jam was  \"out of control\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play!</strong></p>\n<p>Use the mouse to aim/move. The player is constantly shooting and will move away from the cursor position.\u00a0 The player can pickup items (if able) by just moving over them. To complete each floor you must find the key, then make your way to the locked door. Moving over the question mark bullet icon will randomly change your gun type. Hearts can be dropped by enemies or found in chests. Walking over these will restore 1 hp. The square bordered icons containing pictures are powerups. You can collect a maximum of three different powerups per run and cannot drop powerups once they are picked up. Each one modifies the game in some way:</p>\n<p><strong>Pegasus Boots</strong>\u00a0- Faster movement speed</p>\n<p><strong>Cracked Glass Icon (Glass Cannon)</strong>\u00a0- Reduces player hp to 1 but doubles all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Meat Icon (Beefcake)</strong>\u00a0- Player fully heals but halves all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bomb\u00a0</strong>- Player has 30 seconds to complete each floor otherwise they die. You no longer need the key to open the door.</p>\n<p><strong>Teeth Icon (Vampire - op af) -\u00a0</strong>Become invincible. Health drains slowly over time. Kill enemies to reset the timer and keep yourself alive.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>All artwork were created specifically for the Jam.<br/><br/>Music created for the Jam  by Max Thomas, check out more here! - https://soundcloud.com/max-thomas616<br/></p>\n<p>All sound effects came from The Essential Retro\u00a0Video\u00a0Game Sound Effects Collection by Juhani\u00a0Junkala -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aaae9d859f8ee769bfc0ef351859816.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["UltraThizz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
