{"id": 625487, "slug": "qwirk", "name": "Qwirk", "name_original": "Qwirk", "description": "<p><strong>Qwirk</strong> is a small proof-of-concept Metroidvania game with a spellbinding twist. Instead of the extra abilities you gain being permanent, you cast them like spells to gain the respective ability for a short time.\u00a0 These abilities can then be used to overcome the obstacles in the game world, all the while hunting for collectibles.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p><p>In Qwirk, your objective revolves around finding the two spells in the game world\u00a0and using them to find the exit. There are also collectibles to find, but finding\u00a0said collectibles is not mandatory for beating the game - they merely exist as a\u00a0completionist incentive.</p>\n<p>The bar to the top right is essentially your spell timer. You can cast a spell when\u00a0the meter is full. Upon casting a spell, the meter will start going down, and a new\u00a0spell cannot be cast until the previously casted spell runs out and the meter is\u00a0refilled. Only one ability can be active at a time.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df68308f25b9a11eea675c21d8b2717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Santtu \"MFG38\" Pesonen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
