Dash", "description": "<p>This game was made as part of the Global Game Jam 2015 at chika-ba, Japan (see entry), and is only available in Japanese. If you cannot read it, you can still follow the instructions below to play.<br/></p>\r\nVideo\r\n<p>This trailer also shows how this should be played, so we recommend watching it first.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nRules\r\n<p>P.P. Dash is a rhythm game for 2 players controlling 2 kids playing Ring and run at the\u00a0<em>Knock Hotel</em>. During a round, player A sets a rhythm by knocking on certain doors in a row, then player B must repeat the pattern by opening the same doors, a la\u00a0<em>Simon Says</em>.</p>\n<p>If player B opens all the doors knocked by player A, the game continue to the next round. Otherwise (if player B missed a knocked\u00a0door),\u00a0the game ends. Note that player B may open doors that were not knocked without losing.<br/></p>\n<p>It is possible to see the game either as cooperative or competitive:</p>\n<ul><li>Cooperative mode: player A knows as many doors as he/she wants,\u00a0but must count on player B to repeat the pattern. The final score is the number of doors correctly knocked, then opened, minus the number of doors not knocked but opened (penalty).\u00a0You can set a minimum and maximum number of doors to knock each round for\u00a0extra difficulty and to prevent knock spamming, but the game itself doesn't enforce that.</li><li>Competitive mode (rotation):\u00a0player 1 starts as player A, and player 2 as player B. Player B must repeat the patterns of player A\u00a0as many rounds as possible. When player B fails, both players exchange their roles. Players can then compare the number of rounds they passed in the role of player B. To prevent door open spamming, you can set a limit to the number of extra doors to open, but the game itself doesn't enforce that.</li><li>Competitive mode (alternation): similar to rotation, but instead of waiting for one player to be defeated, players 1 and 2 exchange roles every round (of after N rounds). A player can only losing in the role of B, so the first player to miss a knocked door loses.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nStart game\r\n<p>Either play in the embedded HTML game above, or download the web-dl version below and open index.html in a browser (with Javascript active).</p>\n<ul><li>Click on the 1st line (\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u306f\u3058\u3081\u308b) to open the game page.

The missing video is the same as the one at the top of this description.</p>\r\n\r\nIn-game\r\n<p>Click on the left button (\u30ce\u30c3\u30af or \u3042\u3051\u308b) to knock (1st phase with the boy) or open (2nd phase with the girl) a door. If the button is focused, you can also just press Space or Enter.</p>\r\n\r\nContext\r\n<p>The jam's theme was \"What do we do now?\", however this was only loosely followed and instead, all the games made in this location had the following constraint: make the game playable by people with impaired vision. The game meets this criterion by providing audio feedback from player 1's pattern to player 2 reproducing it. It also features very simple HTML to navigate in.</p>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<p>Unfortunately, a small audio desynchronization bug makes it difficult to reproduce the player 1's exact rhythm after a certain number of rounds, but the game remains playable overall.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Masaaki Fukunaga (\u798f\u6c38\u6b63\u660e): Programming support</li><li>Hiroto Morokuma (\u8af8\u718a \u6d69\u4eba): Programming</li><li>Long Nguyen Huu: Programming</li><li>Yasuhiro Chida (\u5343\u7530\u6cf0\u5b8f): Promotional movie, audio</li><li>Haruka Kajikawa (\u68b6\u5ddd\u6674\u9999): Animation, staff</li></ul>\n<p>... and everyone contributed a bit to game design!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:56:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd3838ad1a6f4ad968b8a0aead42ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["komehara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
