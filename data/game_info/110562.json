{"id": 110562, "slug": "putty-saves-goob", "name": "Putty Saves Goob", "name_original": "Putty Saves Goob", "description": "<p>You play as a feline escape artist named Putty. She and her brother travel all over the country to perform on stage. One day, however, Putty's little brother gets kidnapped by a new gang of dogs called the Bad Dogs. It's up to Putty to save her brother and get the heck out of there!</p>\n<p>You need to be stealthy and hide from the dogs. If you leave your hiding spot, they WILL chase you, so be careful! It's also recommended that you interact with the pink objects in the room to finally reach the basement of the dogs' hideout.<br/></p>\n<p>This a game fully made within 2 weeks starting from Jan 7 to Jan 21 2017 for the My First Game Jam: Winter 2017. All tile sets, sprite sheets and programming was done within the jam time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! If you find any bugs or issues, or would just like to leave some feedback in general, feel free to leave a review! Constructive criticism is very much appreciated. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Note: I am aware of some parallaxing issues, and am going to try my best to fix them, but the game is up now so I won't be late on the deadline.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I fixed a few minor things like spelling mistakes and such, so here's version 1.1.<br/></p>\n<p>EDIT: So it looks like I won't be able to fix the parallax problem since to do so, I would have to downres all the backgrounds and everything else, take the game completely appart and put it back together so it would be 1280\u00d7720 in RPG Maker MV. That...doesn't sound possible currently, so I'm going to have to leave it as is. Maybe I'll get back to it at some day, but I'm calling it done now. Sorry about that, folks.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Hold down Shift to run.<br/>Press enter to interact.
