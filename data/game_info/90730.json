Merui also has a very short temper, so when some JERK named Alistair steals a rare item from her, she's determined to exact revenge on him. Unfortunately, she has no idea who he is in real life. But hey, that's never stopped anyone, right? Take control of Merui and make new friends, balance schoolwork and fun, go shopping, search for the culprit, and maybe even discover a new romance.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Staff</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCharacter Design, Art - Lulin Guo<br/>\r\n\tProgramming - Graeme Foote<br/>\r\n\tScenario, Writing - Ayu Sakata<br/>\r\n\tFull Credits\r\n</p><p><strong>Sequel<br/></strong></p><p>\r\n\tEnjoy playing RE: Alistair++?
