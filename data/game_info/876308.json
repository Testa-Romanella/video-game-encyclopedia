Dress up, explore, and get candy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had an absolute blast making Halloween '99. My goal was to make a game focused on the overall experience and vibes rather than mechanics. I want the player to feel just like a kid trick-or-treating to bring back nostalgic memories and create new ones for those who never did it growing up. Thanks for playing, and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Song by Tritnew:\u00a0https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1046932</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:06:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40a/40a6f1eef7ad6cb89404d791fc0748d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ghost Meat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
