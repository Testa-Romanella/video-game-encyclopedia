About the last project, I can't say how much I appreciate the comments I got on Escape Bot! Even though it was a simple game and overall mediocre game, you guys took the time to encourage me, that means a lot! &lt;3<br/><br/>Now for gooey is a different story, this week was kind of turbulent but I managed to make it in time and pretty close to what I\u00a0imagined. It's still pretty simple and arcady, but it's a step forward! (And you can laugh from the slimes bouncing around when you get to 100 Points!)<br/><br/>I put the option for donation when downloading if anyone wants to support me, I\u00a0plan on making a patreon soon and keep making content. I'm working on a bigger project atm that is consuming my time but will be a final release worth the wait, so expect a decent game coming in the next month! Also, next week I'll partake on another jam, the game will be simple but I'll try to give it cute graphics, so keep in tune for that as well!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>W A S D - Move your Droid<br/>Arrow Keys - Aim and Shoot<br/><br/>The more points you have, the more slimes there are, so be careful.<br/>500 points the game is over and you win.<br/><br/>Thanks for everyone who took the time to see my game and read this description, I appreciate it! Comments are more than encouraged!!! Even though this is a simple game that isn't supposed to be polished, just playable, pointing out things that feel awkward or stupid can actually help me a lot with bigger projects, so please do comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T05:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538f894b1afd23027b10d6470f74d98f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wobbumash"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
