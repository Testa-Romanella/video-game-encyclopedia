Due to such\u00a0persistence, the\u00a0two camps that can't tolerate each other\u00a0will never recognize the protagonist, hence they is\u00a0forced to become a wanderer, walking along a\u00a0controversial\u00a0street\u00a0where the two\u00a0camps are on each\u00a0side,\u00a0begging to survive.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a\u00a0kinect\u00a0parkour game combing with dialectical\u00a0thinking training, which\u00a0implies the polarization phenomenon of\u00a0Internet communities, politic opinions,\u00a0personal identification and so on in our real life. The\u00a0players can control the wanderer to walk or run on the\u00a0street by bending their waist to the left and right, deal\u00a0with events of the two extreme camps in different ways\u00a0with their dialectical thinking, keep their mind in the\u00a0neutral position and survive until the end of the game\u00a0time.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T12:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d326fd07ccb131c9cf72566204a94752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["corneliawang"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
