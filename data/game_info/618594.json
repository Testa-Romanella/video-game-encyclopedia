Each\u00a0<strong>RING</strong>\u00a0acts as\u00a0<strong>filter</strong> for both '<strong><em>shape</em></strong>' and '<strong><em>color</em></strong>'.\u00a0For example a yellow circle will allow ALL YELLOW (of any shape)\u00a0and ALL CIRCLES (of any color)\u00a0to pass through. Think <strong>UNO!</strong><br/><br/>Some <strong>RINGS</strong> will be marked as spaceships - they function as filters AND a destination point.\u00a0You need to fully board\u00a0<strong>ALL</strong> spaceships\u00a0on the level with all the shapes (aliens)\u00a0that match\u00a0<strong>BOTH</strong><strong> </strong>its '<em>shape</em>' + '<em>color</em>' to clear the level.</p>\n\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Connect multiple rings together to create a more complex filters</li><li>Separate and connect the right moment\u00a0pull/send desired\u00a0shapes</li><li>Shapes will always try and move to a NEW connected circle when possible.</li><li>Disconnecting the circles resets this relationship.</li><li>If everything gets a little too messy, try resetting the level and attempt from fresh (it's much easier once you have a strategy!)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Design + Art:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jai Bunnag</li><li>Earth Supampon</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Andrea Cecovig</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Heather Young</li></ul>\n<p>*how it fits \"JOINED TOGETHER\" :</p>\n<p>In \u201cUntil We Meet Again\u201d players use a combination of joining and breaking chains of RINGS to create a system that sorts and filters a random group of shapes.
