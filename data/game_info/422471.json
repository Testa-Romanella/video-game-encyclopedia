If you want a challenge - how\u00a0quickly can you grab 1,000 points?<br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Oh, you're still reading? Well! Here's a fun fact, if you hadn't realised:\u00a0<br/>The red bugs travel the slowest, and the pink travel the fastest. That's because pink bugs are worth more! Make sure to catch them quick, though, or they'll fly off.</p><p>Actually, there is three types of buggers worth more than the pink bugs.\u00a0I\u00a0hear they look a bit buttery, eggy, and chocolatey. I\u00a0don't know what that means, but they definitely exist!\u00a0Maybe you can catch them!<br/><br/>And watch out for those pesky electric mosquitoes! Just touching them will over your game!<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!<br/>JamerTheGamer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:54:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db64cfb9a0ce8ba6417e011006c4877.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
