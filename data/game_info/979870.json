Don't be a nerd.<br/><strong>- Short Playtime.</strong> 40 to 60 minutes for a single playthrough, 1.5 to 3 hours to 100% it, aproximately.<br/><strong>- Roughly 50% cinematics, 50% gameplay.</strong> If you don't skip the cutscenes, because then it would be like 0% cinematics and 50% gameplay... No, wait.<br/><strong>- Fresh gameplay.</strong> We promise we didn't xerox it, not explicitly.<br/><strong>- Top Down Grid Based Realtime Shooter Combat.</strong> Think of it as a classic dungeon crawler, but TOP DOWN, REALTIME and without the RPG stuff.<br/><strong>- Easy to learn.</strong> We sincerely believe your mom would be able to handle this one.<br/><strong>- Hard to master.</strong> :)<br/><strong>- Supports KEYBOARD and CONTROLLER.</strong> The Keyboard is the optimal way of putting the heat, however, the Controller works fine as well.<br/><strong>- Banging soundtrack.</strong> Please, have the decency of using your good sound equipment.<br/><strong>- Unique atmosphere.</strong> Nothing really happens in the Federal District after all.<br/><strong>- 3 difficulty levels.</strong> It's a breeze on EZ, on HARD, not so much.<br/><strong>- Upgrade System based on Score Performance.</strong> SCORE = RANK = UPGRADE POINTS<br/><strong>- Unlockable Dossiers with character profiles.</strong> Cuz nobody gets it anyway.<br/><strong>- Low price tag.</strong> Costs even less than you mom.
