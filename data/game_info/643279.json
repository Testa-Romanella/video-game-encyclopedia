If the launch is not successful, they will return to the ground. When the asteroids are coming you will hear a warning sound: look for them immediately after hearing it, otherwise they will collide with\u00a0your planet!</p>\n<p>This is the first game I make for a jam: I hope you will find it\u00a0interesting or, at least, I hope it will\u00a0entertain you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T02:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/629cb639b39e71c4fb6b1bf1d6692b5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["TotallyNotDevs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
