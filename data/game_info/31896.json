To buy a sports car, to build a country house, to find true love, to collect all rare stamps? <br/><br/>What is it? Dream? The purpose of life? Or is it just a mental parasite that has settled in your mind? Any way, your life is no longer a mere existence. Now it is the path. A path that can lead anywhere. A path full of difficulties and questions. <br/><br/>The main character is an example of a person who goes to his goal. No matter what it is, no matter how big it is. <br/><br/>For example - the main character is looking for milk. Does it sound silly? Let it be. <br/><strong>How does it feel?</strong> <br/>Katharsis is a first person exploration game, where you will face a bunch of choices and simple puzzles. Sooner or later those choices will lead you to the end of a story. There are a few endings and together they will provide a full game experience.<br/>But remember - there is no true ending. Every ending is just a piece of a core message that game is trying to say.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d526a9dd19bebeb7d33961a9a75411a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metropolis Software House", "KOCMOC17"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Metropolis Software House", "KOCMOC17"], "esrb_rating": null}
