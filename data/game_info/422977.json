Jam, which had a theme of <strong>solidarity</strong>. We thought long and hard about this theme, and decided we wanted to avoid overt references to current events and instead focus on the idea of everyone working together to get each other through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We designed a puzzle game named\u00a0<strong>Shape The\u00a0World</strong>, in which you play as a collection of different shapes with different skills. Though no individual shape is capable of solving every problem alone, by helping one another they are all able to make it to the other side.</p>\n<p>We all have the power to shape our world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamepad Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is also playable with a controller, but due to time limitations we weren't able to make that very clear in game. The controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Left analogue stick to move</li><li>A (or non-xbox controller equivalent) to perform ability</li><li>X (or non-xbox controller equivalent) to switch to Jess</li><li>Y (or non-xbox controller equivalent) to switch to Dan</li><li>B (or non-xbox controller equivalent) to switch to\u00a0Tom</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sharp Loris are:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jess Molloy (Lead Game Designer,\u00a0Level Design,\u00a0Art)</li><li>Thomas Bassett (Programming, Game\u00a0Design)</li><li>Daniel Williams (Programming, Game Design)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jordan Tallent for helping us out with sound design</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p>\n<p>reCreation by airtone (c) copyright 2019 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/airtone/59721</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/48511aeee8b6c44d69f12e0c034ee2d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sharp Loris"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
