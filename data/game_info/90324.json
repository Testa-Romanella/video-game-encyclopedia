After fighting for decades against an intangible and ephemeral existential threat from beyond the solar system, Earth command has declared the war effort a huge waste of time. The honeymoon is over, and a future of glittering cities across the solar system and cosmic battles between giant robots just isn\u2019t going to happen. The outcome is clear: it\u2019s time to come home.</p>\n<p>But we don\u2019t care. Giant robots may not make any sense. Celestial cities across the solar system are silly dreams. They are, however, extremely awesome. We, the girls who were raised in space, to be special and incredible and pave the way for a new future, aren\u2019t giving up so easily. We\u2019ve got invincible Ship-Selves for ferrying human bodies through time and space, and we have the weight and power to make a fantasy of the future real.<br/><br/>We\u2019re not going out without a fight.<br/><br/><strong>From the Creators of We Know The Devil</strong><br/><br/>Heaven Will Be Mine is a queer science fiction mecha visual novel from the creators of queer cult horror visual novel We Know The Devil, about joyriding mecha, kissing your enemies, and fighting gravity\u2019s pull. Follow three women piloting giant robots in the last days of an alternate 1980s space program fighting for humanity\u2019s future\u2014or ditching their jobs to make out with each other instead.<br/><br/>Experience the story from the perspective of three pilots bound by fate and gravity: veteran ace Luna-Terra, overwhelming super psychic Pluto, and hacker-hijacker Saturn as they fight across three different factions in an eight day war. Your choices decide if they become clandestine lovers or passionate rivals, and which faction\u2019s ultimate plan for humanity\u2019s fate in space and beyond will be realized.
