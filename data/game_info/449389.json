You play as a guy and you run around trying to get from one level to the next (as is the case with most games). You have a gun and the ability to \"record\" your own actions and then trap an alternate version of yourself in a time loop, doomed to repeat the recorded actions over and over until you \"terminate the loop\" (that's what the gun's for).\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nGitHub\r\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://github.com/vix597/torn</p>\n<p>Releases:\u00a0https://github.com/vix597/torn/releases</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>Things I'll maybe do someday if this proof-of-concept turns out to be fun</p>\n<ul><li>More platforming</li><li>Enemies (more uses for the gun)</li><li>Blocks - So that you don't always need a person to stand on a button</li><li>More ways to open doors<ul><li>Completing more complex actions like shooting a bunch of targets</li><li>Solving a puzzle</li><li>etc.</li></ul></li><li>More puzzles/levels (obviously)<ul><li>Specifically, I wanted one where you'd have to make the \"loop\" version of you shoot the \"real\" version of you.
