Set in the 1920s, this puzzle/adventure game transports players to an era of dark screwball comedy where they must unlock the secrets of a twisted mansion. Players will discover the quirks of Wayward Manor\u2019s unwelcome guests and choose how to prey on their darkest fears.  <br/> <br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>The Budds, a dysfunctional family of misfits and eccentrics, have brought their own abysmal possessions into your humble abode and stifled your power.
