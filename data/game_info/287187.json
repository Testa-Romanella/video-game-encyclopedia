Also it was made in scratch and converted using many tools and it probably won't run unless you fullscreen it, unfullscreen, then fullscreen again!</p>\n<p>I'm sorry if you decide to play this, but at least there's a space ship ai that you can shoot at every minute or so.....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d3/6d34fa702ce57a86e59a981321fd06a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KnexPaerdz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
