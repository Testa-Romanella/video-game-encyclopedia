If we meet the goal in the next 2 months we will give access to the money tracking website. More info below.</p>\r\nWhat is so special about this project?\r\n<p>That is right, why should you invest in a project that you have never heard of and are not sure if it will ever see the light of day?\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Well we have got you beat there! The project has these tasks completed:\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Core gameplay\r\n</li><li>Different types of bombs\r\n</li><li>Destructible environments\r\n</li><li>FPS Optimization\r\n</li><li>2 characters\r\n</li><li>Playable demo (Yes you can try the concept out before you decide to kickstart!)\r\n</li></ul>\r\nIf we have done all those things already why do we need your help?\r\n<p>The truth is, our team is made up entirely of programmers and concept artists. We don't have a 3D designer, therefore you can understand how difficult it is to create a game without one. Since we have made all the core things work we now need money to make the game look appealing to it's players. \u00a0We also have\u00a0<strong>NO\u00a0</strong>plans to purchase assets in order to create this game.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Money you (hopefully) pledge will go towards:\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>3D characters\r\n</li><li>3D animations\r\n</li><li>3D props\r\n</li><li>3D blocks\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Visual effects\r\n</li><li>Sound effects\r\n</li></ul>\r\nWhat is our primary method of monetization after release:\r\n<p>The game will cost $14.99 on Steam, Xbox One, and PlayStation 5.\r\n</p>\n<p>As we do not believe in charging for DLC and content updates the following will be released for free:\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Every new map\r\n</li><li>Every new character\r\n</li><li>Every new bomb type\r\n</li><li>Every new update\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>5% of all sales will be used to help fund a project the majority of investors decide on, here on itch.io<br/></p>\r\nAn original idea for the investors:\r\n<p>Since a slew of scams have surfaced in recent years, and people are fabricating fraudulent products in order to defraud you, we've devised a strategy to address the problem, at least for our project.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>We present to you the:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Live funds tracking system.</strong>\n<br/></p>\n<p>What does it do?\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Allows the investors to track every cent that we have received from them.\r\n</li><li>Majority of investors need to agree before we spend money on anything.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>With this system we hope that we can earn your trust for this and any other projects.\r\n<br/><br/></p>\r\nSo you are willing to try out the game demo?\r\n<p>Here you can download the demo and try it out. Keep in mind that the game you are downloading is just a concept and does not represent the final product we intend to release.</p>\n<p>If you do not feel comfortable downloading the game you can check out a YouTube video of the gameplay. Just keep in mind that this video is older than the version we currently have cooking.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NOT AVAILABLE YET</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T08:53:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faa20e0de2cfff2975173c7a1085ad54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PowR Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
