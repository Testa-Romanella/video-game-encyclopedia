Sparky is an adorably insane intergalactic bounty hunter who can dash through obstacles, fire his weapons in any direction and even extend his jumps by flapping his long space-rabbit ears. Each time he brings down a boss, his connected confidante Shigg (half shark, half pig) is ready to point him in the direction of yet another space fugitive.</p>\n<p>In the grand tradition of irreverent 1990s video-game heroes, Spectacular Sparky is as sassy as he is fearless. His voice-acted wisecracks and sarcastic jabs tend to get under the skin of his enemies in a most amusing fashion. And his universe is awash with spikes, lava, buzzsaws, super-saturated colors, slick parallax scrolling and mega-driven music, the way every game ought to be.</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<p>\u2022 A modern homage to the golden age of white-gloved 16-bit video-game mascots<br />\n\u2022 Dozens of delightful story scenes featuring full voice acting and a host of outrageous characters<br />\n\u2022 Five challenging worlds with 24 levels, each with a bombastic boss battle at the end<br />\n\u2022 Five powerful weapon types, including blasters, flamethrowers and homing missiles<br />\n\u2022 Five unique vehicles that Sparky can pilot, including a spaceship, hang glider and lava jet ski<br />\n\u2022 Five difficulty settings, from Supercasual to Supernightmare<br />\n\u2022 Three game modes (What?!
