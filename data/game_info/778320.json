But... I do fully intend to at the very least finish off the game in the coming days/weeks and make it fully available on Github.</p>\n<p>When I started, I was in a bit of a rut. I wanted to make a game, but\u00a0I always felt I had too much to learn to even know where to begin. Game code architecture, 3D modeling even certain features of the Unity engine were still completely outside of my comfort zone or just plain beginner level at best in my opinion. That said, in this project I've touched upon all of these and more. I've definitely grown as a developer, but I also need to work a lot harder on proper scope and time management\u00a0if I'm gonna finish a game on-time for a game jam... Either way. It was fun. :-P</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement</li><li><strong>Esc</strong>\u00a0- Quit<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Left Click </strong>- Attack\u00a0<em>(Not Yet Working)</em></li></ul>\n\r\nTools Used:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Blender </strong>-\u00a03D Modeling</li><li><strong>Unity</strong> - Game Engine</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank You to Kenney.nl for the use of their assets:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Food - 3D Models\u00a0<em>(Not Yet Used)</em></li><li>Furniture - 3D Models\u00a0<em>(Not Yet Used)</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>All other Assets were Self-Made during the Jam</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code:</strong>\u00a0Github\u00a0- <em>Please review and\u00a0criticize my code.\u00a0I don't need positive feedback, I need a better understanding.</em></p>\n\r\nTODO:\r\n<ul><li>Audio<ul><li>Background Music</li><li>Sound FX<ul><li>Attack</li><li>Impact</li><li>Intro</li><li>Pickup</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Finish Off Projectiles<ul><li>Enemy</li><li>Player</li></ul></li><li>Randomized Starting Situations</li><li>Health Pickup System</li><li>Randomized Health Pickup Models</li><li>Boss Health Bar</li><li>Player Health Bar</li><li>Main Menu</li><li>Win/Lose Condition</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bddba7987730fffcbe61e4677cb048d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaosren"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
