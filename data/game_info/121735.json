Unfortunately his spaceship suddenly starts to fail and the journey cannot continue as expected. He and his custom AI, DIAM, are somehow attracted by <strong>a mysterious secret on Kel Leda</strong>, a moon covered with thick ice, where scientists believe that there is a vast liquid ocean under the surface...\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kel Leda was a project for Adventure Jam 2017</strong>, so it is a free short game created in a limited amount of time. It was made in about 10 days from scratch (ideas, story, graphics, audio, development...). Unfortunately I couldn't go as far as I had planned, there are very few interactions with the environments, so it is more a narrative experience than a puzzle game.</p>\n<p>http://jams.gamejolt.io/advjam...<br/></p>\r\nKel Leda is an short indie game, created by one person in 10 days (game jam). It is made of pre-rendered static views like ASA: A Space Adventure (or Myst). However, here, you don't play by watching through the eyes of the hero:  you make the story progress from his computer, with the help of the AI.\r\n\n<strong>English</strong> and <strong>French<br/></strong>\n<br/>Kel Leda is also available for free on IndieDB and Game Jolt.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis game has 1 challenging puzzle for beginners in adventure games - a <strong>walkthrough</strong> is available here.<br/><br/>Homepage: http://www.theblackcube.fr/kelleda\r\n<br/>Original release date: May 19th, 2017<br/><br/>The Original SoundTrack of Kel Leda can be downloaded for free: Bandcamp<br/><br/>For more info about this project, follow The Icehouse collective on Tumblr or Facebook! \r\nhttp://www.theicehouse.fr\r\n\n<p><strong>Features<br/></strong> </p>\n<ul><li>A short and easy game in the Black Cube series\r\n</li><li>HD graphics, prerendered backgrounds in 1080p, developed with Visionaire Studio</li><li>Opening movie in CGI, traditional keyframe animation</li><li>A narrative story with full voice over (french)\r\n</li><li>English and French texts\r\n</li><li>Music and voices generated by the developer during the game jam\r\n</li><li>Includes a nice video making of (concept art, 3d research, modeling, ...)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d754dc23ebe5182c7cb3e912ad8f9ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Icehouse"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
