This game serves as a connecting part between To the Moon and its sequel, Finding Paradise, which were developed by the same studio.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>You play as a little boy, who does not notice any people around him. That is until he finds a bird with a broken wing. People start to appear near the boy presented as ghosts. He begins to fight his Introversion. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Similar to the To the Moon, A Bird Story is a 2D game developed on RPG Maker engine. The game does not feature any combat systems or mechanics whatsoever being a purely story-driven game. Not much dialogue is present in the game due to the developers using a \u201cshow, don&#39;t tell\u201d method of storytelling. </p>\n<p>The in-game map suggests that the game is just a bunch of memories of the boy, rather than a real-time progression of events. </p>\n<p>The gameplay changes depending on the scene the player sees at the moment. Typically, the movement is bind to the arrow keys with the mouse being used for interacting with the in-game world and items. Spacebar is used for more specific actions like throwing. Button prompts appear on screen during the gameplay.</p>\n<h3>Game style</h3>\n<p>Being developed by the same people and on the same engine as To the Moon, A Bird Story features the same-ish style. The aunt of the game&#39;s designer said that the sounds are nice-ish, but they sound ripped off from To the Moon.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2014-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T11:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/01a/01a74b440fba4dce445cc2ff11b99220.jpg", "website": "http://freebirdgames.com/games/a-bird-story/", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 132, "owned": 1388, "beaten": 255, "toplay": 38, "dropped": 16, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 244, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 249, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Freebird Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freebird Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
