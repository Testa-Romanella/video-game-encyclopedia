See here\u00a0for the game jam game, which serves as our prototype.<br/></p>\n<p>In this local-coop game (currently 2-players), the pirates must keep their sinking ship afloat for a duration of time, while leaks keep appearing at the base.</p>\n<p>The players must coordinate with each other to stay afloat by doing the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Using the bucket to empty the ship of the water that's filling in through the leaks.</li><li>Building planks at the work table\u00a0and using those planks to plug in the leaks.</li></ul>\n<p>The less water that's inside the ship, the quicker you will be able to beat the level!</p>\n<p>Each level will also have mechanisms that can be triggered by floor switches. In the current level it's an elevator.</p>\n<p>To activate a floor switch, simply walk on it. A floor switch can only be activated when it's popped up (as opposed to being pushed down).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: regarding the\u00a0<em>descending from platform</em> action,\u00a0not all platforms can be descended from.
