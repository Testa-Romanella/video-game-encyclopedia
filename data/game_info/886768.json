{"id": 886768, "slug": "talkworld", "name": "Talkworld", "name_original": "Talkworld", "description": "<p>TalkWorld is a 'virtual chat environment,' it is a program that allows you to use the Internet to talk to other users of TalkWorld from anywhere on Earth. When you join TalkWorld you will be represented in a visual form by a computer sprite, sometimes called your 'character' or 'avatar'.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>One of the advantages of chat programs is that they are extremely cheap to use. For instance an hour spent talking to someone internationally by telephone would cost you a large amount of money even at the cheapest rate. However because using the Internet is always at local phone rates the same international conversation will cost next to nothing. Most chat programs will\u00a0 \u00a0allow you to type messages to other users but this can be slow so TalkWorld allows you to actually speak to other users using your microphone and speakers, just as if you were speaking on the telephone.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>TalkWorld is designed to represent a small town. Because it is a graphical environment it is easier to use than text only chat programs and can be interesting to explore even when there are only a few users on-line. You can see other users moving around, you can walk into the buildings, in short your character can do most of the things you can do in reality.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Short description of the game^^^<br/><br/></strong>This an archive of Talkworld a\u00a0 \u00a03D\u00a0 chatroom. You cannot make an account as the service is shutdown but you are free to play as a guest and create a character and explore the worlds and maybe meet someone who see this post.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T07:13:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9ac56b51d2bdffddaa24bb5c354d039b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LtGray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
