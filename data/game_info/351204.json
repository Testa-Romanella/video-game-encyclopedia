The game takes place in the 25th century when the CyberCorp corporation learned how to create artificial human bodies and temporarily load people's minds into them for military operations. Each player assumes the role of a agent who has to fight for the corporation ideals!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The planet environment became unsuitable for long life due to many space, nuclear and biological wars in the 25th century. People began to create special \"shells\" through the three-dimensional bioprinting. It allowed them to be controlled at a safe distance and not be exposed to dangerous environmental influences.<br/><br/>The CyberCorp corporation has invented an improved approach to the use of the shell with the ability to partially copy the consciousness of people in it. But she could only perform specific tasks, went crazy over time and became dangerous because of the simplified model of consciousness.<br/><br/>As a result shells were used only for combat operations as CyberCorp agents in corporate wars for power in the world. You take on the role of a corporation agent which will plunge into endless conflicts with enemy corporations of the future!<br/><br/><ul><li>Cyberpunk atmosphere<br/></li><li>Online co-op up to 3 players<br/></li><li>Weapons &amp; armor upgrade with chips<br/></li><li>Rhythmic electronic music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d838537a18d42cb9e19e32fb1e48f7.jpg", "website": "http://cybercorp.online/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IO Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IO Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
