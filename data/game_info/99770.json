When they want to tell things to people but can't. But writing leaves physical evidence. Other people just keep their thoughts for themselves and don't really try to externalize them, which just silently and slowly increases their anger and sadness.</p>\n<p>This is just a little something so that people can put words on their thoughts and think them over without having to worry about the potential traces they left behind afterwards.</p>\n<p>Sounds by freesound users Karma-Ron, flcellogrl, Lord_vor_Edocsil and michaelkoehler </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb387cc47a9eb47c9c1aa5b02cd56d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tyu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
