I love making video games, ever since I discovered scratch I made games. This is probably my biggest project ever, I tried to make a whole JRPG by myself. I love platformer games like mario, and I love JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games), so I decided to try and combine the genre.  This game is 100% free to anyone who wants to play it, because it is still in development. One of the reasons I put this game out for free was so that people could help find bugs. If you download the game and find a bug, please let me know in the comments below. I really hope that you enjoy this short little game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e4f4dc84ac8563ebfe61aca69658beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giise"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
