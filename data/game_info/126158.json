You must complete the mazes and obstacles before you, if you are successful, you will face him in a final battle to free yourself from his stare.  Good luck.<br/></p><p>This game is intended for use with the Tobii Eye X controller, it can however be played with the arrow keys.  The intention here was to create a world where the players eyes are all that is needed to navigate.  It's essentially a collection of mazes that you have to navigate, find an item, and move onto the next level until you come to the Boss Fight.</p><p>I have a son with cerebral palsy and epilepsy and my intention was to make an accessible game that is actually logical (not just shooting stuff on screen), something with puzzles involved, and real time obstacles to avoid; some have patterns and others are random.</p><p>Controls are arrows on the screen, you look at them and they change to green when gazed at, when you look away they return to white.  This is a visual indication that you're looking at the arrows (as well as Tobii has a feature where it shows you with a bubble where your eyes are but this is for the game play).<br/></p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the Tobii Eye X controller, it is an extremely affordable eye gaze game controller.  There are many games that use it as an upgrade to the game, but I use it as the main controller.  As a matter of fact, all Trys10Studios games will be in this way.  I aim to create games that are more involving and accessible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d8940a46a82b2579a3100331a7faa6ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trys10Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
