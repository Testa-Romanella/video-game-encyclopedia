It begins with the artist awakening in a strange world where Ima, his imagination, is now fragmented into pieces. Ima explains that the goal is to try to put together these pieces (colors). To progress, the painter needs the most important object in his work, a brush. With this you can open the door that will give you access to new worlds where you can gather the colors you need to resurrect your imagination. These colors reflect the character of these worlds. There you will find several obstacles that will condition your progress and that may prevent you from reaching your goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb0bf9437a3b2ccca21124137f0eb3dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tundraviolet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
