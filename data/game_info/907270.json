You can observe each country's temperatures by aiming at them. Each country displays a colour that is relative to their respective temperature.\u00a0You can shoot an extractor blast into a country to extract low-poly crops. Crops are displayed by propelling themselves into their respective orbits with zero gravity physics. There are a total of 3 orbits with each one signifying the size and quantity of the produce with the inner one being the smallest and the outer one being the largest (10k -&gt; 100k -&gt; 1 mil per model, the bigger the model the higher the quantity).\u00a0<br/><br/>All controls are displayed on the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T15:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3d/e3d6bc879fd0812fcf26324517ff2af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RamyBro"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
