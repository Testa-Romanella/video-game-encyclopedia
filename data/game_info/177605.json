(A group of friends on a mission to take over the world).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our HQ(a studio apartment) is under attack by the Devil Hunters (A cult that recently caught wind of our plans), and <strong>Stella</strong>(TEAM 42's sorceress and most powerful member) is the only one who can save us.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, she's in mid slumber.</p>\n\n<p>As team <strong>strategist</strong>, it is your duty to... uh... wake her up. She'll keep falling asleep every now and then.</p>\n<p>Ah, yes! You could also tell her what to summon, and where! <em>Right-click</em> for our own Dark Knights(Mirror of enemy knights), and <em>Left-Click</em> for those powerful, but temporary Turrets. (They can shoot in a 6 block radius, you know!)</p>\n\n<p>Make sure to Wake her up <strong>TWICE</strong> to <strong>fully awaken</strong> her. Once when she's sleeping, and again when she's lifted her head(she's still\u00a0<strong>Groggy</strong>).</p>\n<p>She can still summon while Groggy, just taker her more\u00a0energy. (It's limited, so use wisely)</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don't let them get to the <strong>bottom of the grid</strong>! The wall can hold them off for a few turns, but try not to let them break it!</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, and you can pause time by hitting the <em>Space-Bar</em>.</p>\n<p>Well, go on then!</p>\n<p>- Gurdan (TEAM42 founder &amp; leader)</p>\n\n<p>Note: This project is HEAVILY unfinished. Missing animations, lack-lustre textures and sprites, no sound-fx, and a hastily put together Menu and UI.</p>\n<p>Still, I'd love some feedback. Do you think this game has potential?</p>\n\n<p>Game design\u00a0/ Programming / Art -\u00a0\u00a0Rahul R.(ATaciturnGamer)</p>\n<p>Soundtrack:-</p>\n<p>NightRunner\u00a0(Audionautix.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e8036c39b52dc79b26994aee570c3531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ATaciturnGamer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
