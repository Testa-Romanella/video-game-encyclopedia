{"id": 113803, "slug": "3rogues", "name": "3ROGUES", "name_original": "3ROGUES", "description": "<p><strong>-STORY-</strong></p>\n<p>The rogues Light, Trad, and Vigor were having brunch with the princesses of the three lands, Forest, Ocean, and Lava. Out of nowhere, the rogues' evil doppelgangers appeared and kidnapped the princesses! Now they must traverse the worlds to save the princesses and defeat their dark counterparts.</p>\n<p><strong>-GAMEPLAY-</strong></p>\n<p>Light, Trad, and Vigor are all playable and have different ways of playing the game, so pick whoever suits you! They can also be switched whenever you enter a shop, which contain randomized items that can be bought by selling loot found in treasure chests or killing enemies. Speaking of enemies, they can only be killed with a backstab. Watch out though, they can be pretty tricky and mischevious! Sometimes, attacking may not even be the best option. If you die, you'll be taken to the beginning of the world you were on and lose all progress made since then, so be careful!</p>\n<p><strong>-MUSIC-</strong></p>\n<p>I created all of the music for this game and tried to work as closely to the NES music limitations as possible (2 square waves, 1 triangle wave, 1 noise channel). It was an interesting challenge and something I hadn't tried before so I would appreciate feedback and such!\u00a0It is on sale for $1 (or more)\u00a0at my Bandcamp website.</p>\n<p><strong>-OTHER STUFF-</strong></p>\n<p>The Mac version of this game has not been tested, so if any of you run into problems while using please let me know and I can attempt to fix them. Worst case I'll decommission it but it should be okay.<br/>Thanks to my roommates and my friend Shelby for testing the game and my buddy Skilar for letting me use the art he made for my other game in this one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fa/1fadf3e80691c1ecc13a036f2bec101e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Useless Torch Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
