Curiously still alive 15 years later, it has turned into a quirky savage arena shooter I'm still learning from. <br/><br/>The goal was to make Vibrant as hypnotic as possible. I think it specifically trains short-term memory, as the number of things to remember in combat may well exceed your capacity for recent events. <br/><br/>If you feel overwhelmed, try to ask yourself the question \"Can I focus more?\".
