The sounds are rather important to the game.<br/>Missing Memories is a small game about being misgendered and finding your own validation. <br/>It was inspired by a very real memory.<br/></p>\n<p>Content warning for misgendering.</p>\n<p>This game was made with the Bitsy game maker tool, I highly recommend using it as a first time game designer. Check it out at https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy<br/>Additionally, I used the incredible functionality of the Borksy hack for Bitsy, which can be found at https://ayolland.itch.io/borksy</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my Patrons for their support.
