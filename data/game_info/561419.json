When you're stuck, try getting some help from the natives. They may be squares but they\u00a0seem very nice!</p>\n<p>This was my very first 3D project and also my first anticipation in a game jam. It was a ton of fun and I hope you all like my entry.</p>\n<p>Also big thanks to Ronald Gerth\u00a0for allowing me to use his voice and the\u00a0audio from the YT video\u00a0'Snake Eggs Magnets Fun' in the Soundtrack of the game!</p>\n<p>Also also\u00a0the file size is 69mb so the game is pretty much perfect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35df62b0d99e0036ef88056066254d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leon Seidel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
