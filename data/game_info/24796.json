{"id": 24796, "slug": "top-hunter", "name": "TOP HUNTER", "name_original": "TOP HUNTER", "description": "<p>Take on the role of either Roddy or Cathy, bounty hunters in this<br />\nside-scrolling action game set far in the future when humans have<br />\ncolonized space. But all is not well: Space pirates called the Klaptons<br />\nare making their way through the galaxies, wiping out peaceful<br />\nsettlements along their path. This disgraceful behavior leads to them<br />\nhaving a price on their heads, so now Roddy and Cathy must travel<br />\nthrough four distinct worlds on a mission to defeat their leader,<br />\nCaptain Klapton. Both characters have retractable arms-used to grab<br />\nenemies or other objects in the scenery-that can then be thrown at<br />\nothers to destroy them. Also, be on the lookout for rings or levers to<br />\npull, as this might reveal special bonuses. Further adding to the mix,<br />\nthe game uses a unique system where the action happens on two planes,<br />\nwith the player switching between them at will. Can you prove yourself<br />\nworthy of the Top Hunter name and help save the universe?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T14:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/419/419fb5fbbe4025132ae48a971b089747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["D4 Enterprise"], "esrb_rating": null}
