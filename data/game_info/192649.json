This game is played between two people on the same computer. Players select cards at any time during their turn using a valuable resource called Energy. You earn Energy at the end of each turn or by winning a battle. Energy can be used to buy more cards, initiate a battle, or capturing a blank tile. In the battle you may use up to 4 cards. On the first turn of the battle the person who is not going must look away from the screen. The person who has the higher Energy amount wins. Good Luck! (This game is best played with the Retro Computer font.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a45eeedd4977c70140c4696c96319df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dankgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
