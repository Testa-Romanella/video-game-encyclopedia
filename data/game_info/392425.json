And you will see now!<br/>\r\nDifferent from other STGs, most of the enemies have unlimited HP, which means you cannot hurt them just by shooting. But you can shoot or push them to the top, bottom or right edge to kill them. If they touch the left edge, you will be damaged.<br/>\r\nYour HP is connected with your energy level, that is to say, when you have much HP, you are powerful. Otherwise, you will be so weak.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHot keys:  <br/>\r\nX: Shoot    <br/>\r\nC: Flash   <br/>\r\nZ: Auto Shoot Switch<br/>\r\n\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192: Move", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T04:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9dee65a84a12e563bfff8483ed5872e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Allinone Loner"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Allinone Loner"], "esrb_rating": null}
