As you progress through the nights, new things are introduced, and you will also learn about the story of what happened to the place. This is a fangame of FNaF and Baldi's Basics which combines game mechanics from both. Even though the full version isn't done yet, a new demo has been released that allows you to experience the first night. I hope you will like this game, and enjoy playing it!</p>\n<p>You Can Play The Old Demo Test Version Here:\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311037397/</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>A - Turn Right (Turn Right Button On Mobile)</li><li>D - Turn Left\u00a0(Turn Left Button On Mobile)</li><li>W - Close/Open Door Your Facing\u00a0(Toggle Door Button On Mobile)</li><li>S - Turn On/Off Door Light Your Facing\u00a0(Toggle Light Button On Mobile)</li></ul>\n<p>Gameplay Videos:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLURarhFDayNYKblHnlXUEMGj3mLYMTWCo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221890e78d4378e6ce1cc8978616b7ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["JohnsterSpaceGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
