Set in a world gripped by a war of magic, you and other spellcasters fight for control over 5 rounds of battle in areas of power.<br/><br/>Using a limited amount of currency that increases throughout the game, you must determine the best spells for the job from your varied arsenal and defeat your enemies by reducing their health to 0. Will you focus on Offensive spells such as <strong>Fireball</strong> and <strong>Meteor</strong>, or will you <strong>Windwalk </strong>your way through your opponent\u2019s attacks and <strong>Counter Pulse</strong> their spells back at them? With an ever-changing environment that poses as much of a threat as your opponent, adaptation is just as important as a quick hand and mind. In such a brutal and chaotic world, only the skilled and strong will be victorious.<br/><br/>So, don your robes, banish your summoned Rock Pillars, and prepare to do battle in the arena of Spellsworn!<br/><br/><ul><li>Test your wits and reflexes in spell-filled multiplayer combat, either alone or in teams - supports up to 8 players.<br/></li><li>Choose your loadout from over 40 spells across 6 different disciplines - Offensive, Defensive, Area, Utility, Travel, and Melee<br/></li><li>Engage in battle across 3 unique arenas, each with their own dangers and demands<br/></li><li>Gain experience through battle, earning skins, weapons and more as you level up</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T14:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae330076ae5c7330eeb8b52dd86414b7.jpg", "website": "http://www.spellsworn.com", "rating": 2.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 466, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 26, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frogsong Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frogsong Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
