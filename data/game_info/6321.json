{"id": 6321, "slug": "lumino-city", "name": "Lumino City", "name_original": "Lumino City", "description": "<p>Lumino City is a puzzle-adventure video game developed by State of Play Games and a sequel to 2011 title Lume. </p>\n<h3>Art style and plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows Lumi, a simple girl that lives with her grandad. One day the grandad gets kidnaped, and now she must go to the nearby Lumino City to find him. <br />\nThe game is notable for its paper cut-out art style. While the main character is CGI, all of the environments are crafted by developers using cardboard, paper, wood, and other crafts materials. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Lumino City is a point-and-click adventure game with heavy emphasis on puzzle solving. The game uses a mouse to control Lumi and interact with objects. Her backpack serves the role of in-game inventory and fits many items required to solve in-game puzzles. <br />\nThe game consists of several levels, each of them usually takes two-to-three screens. Some of them revolve around interacting with Lumino City\u2019s townsfolks that asks Lumi for help in exchange for opening her way to the next level. Most of the game takes place in the city, so houses and streets are natural environments in the game. Aside from solving puzzles, some of which incorporate minigames in the vein of Machinarium or Samorost, some swinging and climbing sections require clicking certain objects at the right time.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T11:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3eeda27c87b928e34e3aed574cce1b58.jpeg", "website": "http://www.luminocitygame.com", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 943, "beaten": 40, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 30, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 70, "suggestions_count": 424, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 71, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Noodlecake Studios", "State of Play Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["State of Play Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
