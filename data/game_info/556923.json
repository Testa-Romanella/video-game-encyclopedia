All players are in the same room and they have to steal things by hiding in the crowd while trying to find the other players (and remember their appearance). If anything is successfully stolen, the round end by a profiling sequence where each player have a chance of giving the identikit of the thief.</p>\n<p>Inspirations for this game mainly are Unspottable, Spy Party and the Netflix TV Show Lupin (Which you better not be watching, you're wasting time you could spend reading Hamlet again !).</p>\n<p>This game is made for at least 2 players, you can try it alone but do not expect any sort of fun (and even in multiplayer, don't expect too much). You'll also need controllers to play.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T07:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e18e89d5806ae5dbec2c11790e370c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Melvhandar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
