However, leaving is tough because you don't want to be rude! So you need to get back to your car without upsetting anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You need to try to avoid other people on your way out of this party\u00a0otherwise you'll get caught up in\u00a0<strong>a\u00a0</strong>conversation! This will cost you rest points. You are free to leave most conversations, however if you do so you will incur a karma penalty. But think strategically, because each piece of dialogue also costs you rest points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Answer questions poorly and you'll lose both rest AND karma!\u00a0 Be sure to time your responses appropriately so that you can always give the best responses!</p>\n<p><em>Important Note: The friend in the kitchen will not cost you rest or karma points!</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A Button interacts with just about everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keyboard Mapping:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD ==&gt; Move</p>\n<p>Left Ctrl ==&gt; A Button</p>\n<p>Left\u00a0Alt ==&gt; B Button</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks To and Explantion</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created as part of the Extra Jame #6 (2020). I really appreciate the challenge of creating a game in just 3 days, especially since I just came off of the LowRezJam2020! This was a great experience because it forced me to do everything from scratch with almost no time. Scope reduced forever!</p>\n<p>Really want to thank the following people:</p>\n<p>The Extra Credits crew and the people on the Discord server in this jam. You all are amazing!</p>\n<p>Games Plus James!</p>\n<p>Also want to thank YOU the player! Thank you so much for playing my game and for reading this text. YOU are awesome!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who Built This?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Built entirely by me, all assets, coding, and music/sound effects (it shows)\u00a0 were done by me, Joseph Garland.
