The game takes place in a steam-powered world where the player assumes the role of a handyperson tasked to repair a malfunctioning beacon. Book of Adventum <strong>combines the time-honored problem solving of adventure FPS games - shooting people in the face and getting through not-so-difficult puzzles - with metaphysical ponderings, which you can happily ignore.</strong> The art style of the game takes a deep bow to the genre originators from the mid-aughts with a cartoon-esque flair. Explore every cranny and nook of the open sandbox world, and that's about 10 hours. <br/><br/>The soundtrack of the game includes tracks from mystical metal band <strong>KuuDelta</strong> and ambient master <strong>Cyborg See Cyborg Do</strong>.<br/><br/>Here's how it's going to be:<br/><br/><ul>[A single player Action-Adventure FPS]</ul><ul>[Crafting and Modding]</ul><ul>[Moody and broody]</ul><ul>[Pretty slow-paced: smell the flowers, shoot things, loot, repeat]</ul><ul>[Indie AF]</ul><ul>[Combat Arena mode]</ul><ul>[Sandbox / Semi-open world and fast travel]</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-25T15:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e71e1b711b8e2372636df93d79092d.jpg", "website": "https://bookofadventum.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Amber Softworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kuusan Kino"], "esrb_rating": null}
