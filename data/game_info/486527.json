I've been working on it for the last two years as a side project, hopefully the next chapters won't take as long :) It's built with Phaser JS, and some parts with Vue. You can read more about the development process in my dev diary.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What is Radio Liberty?</strong><br/>Radio Liberty used to be a real place, the antennas were taken down on 2001. You can read more about the project on Wikipedia. This game is <strong>completely fictional</strong>, it has nothing to do with the Cold War or communism, it is set in an alternative universe where the antennas where never taken down, and instead were used for very different purposes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>I did all the code and graphics. Find sound/music related credits here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e759e2120ad9deb6342ce66a938fa18f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N\u00faria"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
