This is, apparently, a known issue with the WebGL builder that we're asked to use. Additionally, despite making the game in the requested resolution of 960 x 540, the embed cuts off corners, likely due to the bar at the bottom taking up room. Due to this, I had to extend the screen size so that it could fit everything (960 x 580).\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>ASSETS USED:</p>\n<p>Title and end screen backgrounds</p>\n<p>-https://wallpapersafari.com/w/bgpYsQ</p>\n<p>Music</p>\n\n\n<p>Sound Effects</p>\n<p>-all sounds are from \"Touhou Eiyashou ~ Imperishable Night\" by Jun'ya Ota</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T12:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b4031788e040daa348de7db938fd9f0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["reversity"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
