While I did write a lot of code/blueprints myself, I didn't create all of this from scratch. I'm just one guy who wanted to create something fun to play with my friends. I wanted to make it the game I want to play with levels and weapons that I love.  That being said, I do take feedback seriously and will try my best to to fix any bugs, take suggestions, or change basic game mechanics. At the end of the day, this game is meant to just be fun. No grinding. Not overly complicated. Not stressful. Just good, laughable, simple, fun. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI work a full 40+ hour week as a mechanic but spend most of my free time working on this game, mostly to the chagrin of my wife and daughter. If I don't get back to you quickly on Discord or updates aren't as fast as hoped, know that I am working as fast as I can and will get back to you as soon as possible. This project means a lot to me and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I do.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T08:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e45eedcce06b1ad426502c7b7d75566b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadow Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Shadow Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
