Mister Pitz is a platformer shooter hybrid made to look like a Commodore 64 game. In the game, Mister Pitz is a pizza slice who doesn't have any legs or feet. So he has to hop his way though several challenging levels in order to get the thing he needs to grow his own legs and feet - growth cookies! I hope you enjoy the demo for Mister Pitz by JH Games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343ba655b78dbf4ad6eebf7ed6a36c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JH Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
