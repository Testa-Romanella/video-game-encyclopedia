If you haven't played WarioWare before, I recommend checking out some longplay videos on Youtube:\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p> The goal with this project is not to make a 1:1 reproduction of the original games, but to provide a framework for playing microgames and allowing\u00a0anyone\u00a0to create their own microgames. Also,\u00a0crediting and discovery will be a primary focus\u00a0- the dream is to make a system in which you can easily bookmark microgames you enjoyed and trace the creators back to their external social media or portfolio sites. In short - I want to give WarioWare the\u00a0Little Mario\u00a0treatment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T20:03:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a6154fed141c03b15eb50ebc2ad949.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NEW CYLANDIA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
