The source\u00a0code is available above and at\u00a0https://bitbucket.org/ltpour/i-am-the-intergalactic-wizards.</p>\n<p>Apology to GNU/Linux users: The game was made with Godot Engine and built with the standard export templates from\u00a0https://godotengine.org/downlo... which unfortunately produce a binary that depends on PulseAudio. So far my attempts to build working export templates without this anti-feature have been unsuccessful. However the game runs fine from the Godot editor (you need the source code to do this)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26edd72e2295c7b188c4806ec41a608a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HorseSoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
