It's a bit of an ego project but it was fun to just indulge myself that way.</p>\n<p>It's a hidden object game, but with a few cool new additions from last year. You can collect music, there are more NPCs, quests, minigames, and special items to collect!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T02:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c6258986e00c10c6d49818e16400663e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
