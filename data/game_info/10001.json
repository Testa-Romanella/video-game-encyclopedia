This is a central hub for the whole Serious Sam franchise, which includes remastered and VR versions of both First and Second Encounters, and Serious Sam 3: BFE. The series follows Sam Stone\u2019s adventures set in the environment of Egyptian pyramids, jungles and medieval castles. According to the plot, the protagonist fights against science-fictional extraterrestrial forces and their leader Mental, whose only aim is the devastation of humanity. The gameplay consists of eliminating waves of re-spawning invaders all across the game map. Enemies themselves range from basic soldiers to gigantic robots. As far as health and armor are non-regenerative, players controlling Sam have to gather special packs, which are scattered all around, in addition to dodging aliens\u2019 attacks. From the technical side remasters offer lots of graphical issues and fixtures. The 2017 Fusion also allows players to maneuver within the whole series not exiting the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/21b/21babfc41e2a6972290833d1b860f13e.jpg", "website": "http://www.croteam.com", "rating": 3.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 290, "owned": 4681, "beaten": 73, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 121, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 324, "suggestions_count": 545, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 324, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Croteam"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Croteam"], "esrb_rating": null}
