{"id": 569897, "slug": "eros1", "name": "EROS1", "name_original": "EROS1", "description": "<p>For this project, I wanted to tell a story about growing up and having to make difficult decisions. It features two characters, Alic and Mia. There are four different endings and an opportunity to switch character perspectives if you go down a certain path. I wanted the player to have the opportunity to grow and learn with the character setting up a familiar world that once explored, quickly changes, and warps into something else. Something that might not be as positive as led out to be. I want the reader to travel along this journey with the protagonist, and unveil what lies behind the mask of the home that at first seems safe and secure. Discovering these types of secrets in stories is a big thrill factor for a lot of audiences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main character, Alic, wants to continue to live his own life but needs to grow up a face the world that they grew up without. Depending on the decision he makes, his best friend might accompany him on his future journey in the end. Otherwise, he faces a treacherous and lonely venture based on what he believes to be right and just. This story is about growing up and having to leave things behind whilst having to find out right from wrong for yourself and not have to rely on others to tell you.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are a few, very crucial moments in the story. One of them is getting the passcode to the locked room to discover the true intentions of the UNN, United Nations Navy. Without this information, the reader is not getting the full story which could affect their ending. There is also the option of taking or denying the Colonel\u2019s offer to serve. Another big decision point is to talk to Mia at the end or do what you\u2019re told and reject her. This decision affects the final outcome. All of these decisions relate back to the want vs need and discovering the truth and having to make these hard decisions.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The story braches and comes back together, giving you different options, but the boldest and brave decisions will lead you to get the most information from the story. The final branches that take you down different paths occur towards the end, where the tension and pacing start to pick up. This potentially causes vastly different outcomes. I wanted to give the reader as much flexibility in the story as possible to get a happy ending. Eventually, if enough of the wrong paths are taken, the player will get locked into their path and you will switch character perspectives, are still able to make decisions, but not affect the actions of the main character.\r\n</p>\n<p>Most of the decisions are based on the risk vs. reward system and the reader\u2019s disposition towards curiosity and want to break the rules. There is a lot of suspense through the story and a big premise on the discovery and exploring the unknown. Alot of information throughout the story has moral implications and can only be discovered if the reader is actively paying attention and is invested in the main character and their actions. Only then will they discover the information that is vital for discovering the best outcome.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b088fa817aba1b89f236f2ad3e99fe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TR Kerr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
