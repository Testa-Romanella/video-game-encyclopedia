The first game was actually a horror and suspense 3D based game, but unfortunately it didn't really come up to fruition.\u00a0 My main goal was to get\u00a0<em>a\u00a0</em>game into this huge GameJam, so I <em>technically\u00a0</em>did do so. I'm hoping very much that the horror game I get to submit as some sort of Post-Jam kind of thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry for the\u00a0<strong>extremely</strong> rushed nature of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T02:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/536233b7c982a06de31724568490632e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["orionintheforest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
