Disorganised tribesmen were usually no match for the heavily-defended cities and their shrewd generals, but, on rare occasions, a gifted individual would unite the warriors and rouse them to a common purpose. Then, the kings, the patriarchs, the farmers and the merchants would have cause to tremble before the approach of the Barbarians!<br/></p>\n<p>Barbarians is a game of strategy for one player, running on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. You take the lead of a civilised league of twelve cities at the very time the barbarians are entering the land. Your task is to raise armies and send them against the advancing hordes, and you will not rest until every last one is wiped out. While this is going on, you have to manage your empire's economy.</p>\n<p>Every game is different. A map is generated at random, and your empire might be inland, on the coast, an isthmus or a peninsula, or it might instead be on an island. You may rule over flat, featureless plains, or mountainous or heavily wooded areas. The terrain of your country will dictate the availability of resources and the economics of your campaign. You'll need to trade for resources that your empire lacks.</p>\n<p><em>Released 24th December 2012</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/11237889f0f8f73ecfd40e36dd97a8fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damian Gareth Walker"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
