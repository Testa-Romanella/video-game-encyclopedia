New Vegas. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead\u2026 and that\u2019s before things really get ugly. It\u2019s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It\u2019s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you\u2019ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures, and much more.
