For my senior quest, I decided to make a game with the largest scope I've ever attempted. \u00a0I was inspired by the hovering and wall climbing mechanics of Gargoyle's Quest 2, but I've always felt that the RPG overworld and fetch quests in that game really bog it down. I decided to take Gargoyle's Quest 2's controls and re-frame them as a metroidvania where you unlock the hovering and wall climbing abilities as you progress. Hopefully you all enjoy the finished product; I look forward to hearing what people think of it.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE that the current version of the game does NOT have a save feature.\u00a0The game is only ~2 hours long and can easily be beaten in one sitting, but be warned that\u00a0your progress will be lost should you close out of the window.</p>\n<p>You can follow me on twitter here: https://twitter.com/RedOshal</p>\n<p>I sometimes post playthroughs of my games on YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channe...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e66c726bf43e6d8ada97b77a150face3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SuperPokeunicorn"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
