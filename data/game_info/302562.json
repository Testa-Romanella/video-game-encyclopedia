In this demo, the focus is on platforming and exploration. <br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game, so I am not really sure what to say here... I will try to put more details here over time as well as credits and attributions later.</p>\n<p>As a prototype, there WILL be bugs. So please let me know what kind of bugs you find. Any feedback/critiques are greatly appreciated!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>An xbox controller is highly recommended, but the game will work with keyboard controls. Other controllers/gamepads may work, but are not recommended. Also note that if you use an xbox controller, by default \"A\" and \"B\" are inverted, which may cause some confusion. You can change that in the application startup dialogue box when you first click open the game. There will be in game button mapping in the future!<br/></p>\n<p>Currently for Windows only, but I am working on Mac and Linux and hope to have them available very soon!</p>\n<p>You may Stream/record the game :)<br/></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, let me know. It helps out a ton!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimum System Requirements</strong>:</p>\n<p>Dual Core CPU</p>\n<p>DX10 GPU</p>\n<p>2GB RAM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/506b3b1d2b2acc8333f0e871c49afaf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScrapPaperDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
