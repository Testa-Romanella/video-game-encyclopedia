As a result, the coastal cities are all but completely submerged. Since man's disappearance, the oceans have begun to reclaim themselves, with coral and nearly extinct creatures returning to their once-thriving levels. But the artifacts of man's presence still remain, and an elite race of whales known as the Elders enlist Jupiter and Mars to help neutralize a global network of machines that are disrupting sea life. Along the way, Jupiter and Mars will perform incredible feats and maybe even survive to tell the tale. <br/><br/><br/><br/>1 player<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>PlayStation\u00aeVR Compatible<br/>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Compatible<br/>Enhanced play with 1 PS VR Aim controller<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
