Inspired by other top down shooter games like Skyforce, with an arcade feeling to it. This is an endless game mode, where the sole objective is to get as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>This is my first game created in Unity for the Android platform. You can find the apk file to install the game, or if you want to improve the game yourself, feel free to download the entire project and edit it in Unity. This game was created as part of an assignment. If you want to donate, feel free to do so and I\u00a0do thank you a lot for it. Otherwise, the game will always be free for you to download and try.</p>\n<p>I do not take credits for the assets used in the game.
