I never said your ship would look pretty.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>You are the AI adjutant of the 'General Purpose Machine' MUTEKI. After a failed defense of the planet Earth, your ship is catapulted into an unfamiliar galaxy teeming with scrappers and triads who'd like a transistor-level view of your head. Use your GPM to assimilate parts of enemy ships and/or innocent bystanders, build a big chugging unbalanced war machine, plow through heavily-armed police fleets and find a way back home.</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\t...or at least, that's what you'd do if the game were anywhere near done.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis physics sandbox demo showcases the advanced 'free cutting' damage system, which lets you carve up enemies any way you like-- they'll break apart dynamically, and orphaned equipment modules will cease to function. In the next demo, you'll also be able to \r\n\t<em>attach</em> them any way you like.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWith free scrap placement and the already-implemented automatic thrust balancer, MUTEKI aims for a more spontaneous and visceral experience than similar offerings. Heavily inspired by Battleships Forever, its damage system could be considered the logical conclusion of that game.\r\n</p>Asset CreditsLibraries<ul>\n<li>Lp_solve 5.5</li>\n</ul>Sprites<p>\r\n\tUsing \"Starfield stock\" by Smatilla (\r\n\thttp://smattila.deviantart.com/).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tShips kitbashed from sprites by\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Kaelis</li>\n<li>HorseMonster</li>\n<li>Cycerin</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\t...and anybody else I may have missed from the Wyrdysm Games forums.
