This project is for demonstration only and is free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a 2-player turn-based trajectory game. The goal is to hit the catapult of the other player with your ball until its health is 0.</p>\n<p>To throw the ball, use your mouse. Drag and release to fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may also use keys A and D to move your catapult left (away from the center) or right (towards the center) correspondingly. However, your move is limited. Your time is also limited. Plan carefully!</p>\n<p>Wind resistance exists! The direction of the snowfall should guide you. Also, if your catapult falls from the platform, you automatically lose the round.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:41:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b4/6b44027146520039acc863d3b7c17e17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Janean"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
