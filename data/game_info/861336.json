In this game, the negative impact of using a phone all day long is highlighted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a small town. People of the town were happy together. One day a ghost came to the town and gave everyone a phone and got their hearts in exchange. Thereafter, everyone was busy on their phone all day long. Everyone in the town became alone, heartless like the ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA radio in a family used to witness the joy of a little kid, when his sister, father, mother were playing with him. After exchanging their hearts with the phones, the\u00a0family of the kid were busy with the phones all day long. No one there to play with him, look after him.
