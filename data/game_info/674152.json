The way of promotion usually results from the downfall of another. And Priam has been trying to escape for quite some time. That, and this might be the perfect opportunity for a snake to rear its ugly head</p>\n<p>But it's just Pumpkin Cake. You don't need to be culinarian extraordinaire to pull this off. Perhaps there's nothing to worry about. Or maybe they need to be afraid? Read and find out!</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed my jam and would love to support the team, drop by our discord as I continue writing my main project, \"Philistine\". All support is appreciated!\u00a0https://discord.gg/4AQePJJS</p>\n<p>Lastly, I just wanted to state that this is my first game ever released. No, I'm not using this as a crutch in hopes the critics will go easy on me....well kinda, but the point is to me this project is a major achievement for me. Not many people can tell their friends that they've made a video game before. I didn't enter this jam because I wanted to win, but to test my skills and release something that I could tell others that I made. I hope my project inspires to prsue their dreams just as I have.</p>\n<p>Credits were Credits are due!</p>\n<p>Writer and Director;\u00a0UltraShiko (@UltraShiko) / Twitter</p>\n<p>Sound Composer; Slyfox#7128 (https://slyfoxaudio.wixsite.com/website\u00a0his website)</p>\n<p>Character and Background Artist\u00a0Bizzmasterom (COMMISSIONS OPEN) (@bizzmasterom) / Twitter</p>\n<p>GUI and Logo Designer m.#0911</p>\n<p>GUI Implementer https://mobile.twitter.com/mad_scientist92</p>\n<p>Sound FX</p>\n<p>From Freesound.org, I used works from the following artists.
