How about you go on a quest to find the king's girlfriend's lost crown instead? And shoot stars at stuff? And also save the world? And kick some koala butt along the way?</p><p>This game is at its core a metroidvania with a level selection map. The game gets quite serious after the first few levels, so good luck completing this one! High points are probably the secret levels and bosses, throw-able princesses and wall-running.</p><p>As me second-ish platformer, this game turned out kind of okay. It's just very hard overall. But Sean Cameron's soundtrack is totally awesome! Maybe that'll help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2d12958bfdae40d5c9ed58ad0b5ef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["origamihero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
