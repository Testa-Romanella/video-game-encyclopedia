With this game, Jumping Jester, I'm satisfied that I've met my project aims.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A short, difficult, sightly frustrating, replayable game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jumping Jester is an endless runner, with eight unlockable characters. Difficult control system based on a joystick. It gets fast quickly!\u00a0!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Future updates are in the works. Such as adding environmental changes like changing season as you progress, stage movement and obstacles. As well as a respawn ability.</p>\n<p>All feedback is warmly welcomed and I'd love to hear from you guys in the comments section, here or on Google Play.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thanks !</p>\n\n<p>I must also shout-out the hero Kenney.
