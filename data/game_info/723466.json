The Wild West of the underworld is a concentrated, amplified echo where only the most vile and villainous figures of the American frontierlands were banished.</p>\n<p><em>Six in the Chamber</em> imagines a version of the afterlife that mimics the real-life American 'Wild\u00a0West'. Follow the story of a fallen bandit, betrayed by his villainous brothers-in-arms. After being killed and left for dead, the fallen bandit found himself in a violent afterlife not dissimilar from the world he left behind.<br/></p>\n<p>After years of waiting, those who betrayed him have joined him in the underworld. Claw back the soul that was stolen from you and enact your revenge on those who you once believed to be the only who had your back.</p>\n\r\nThe game is still a work in progress.
