My room in particular has grown into an\u00a0accidental curation of myself and every version of me there\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 I may outgrow phases and clothes, but these physical objects remain.</p>\n<p>So what does it mean when I have to clean it out? What is it like to throw away items that have come to be artifacts of myself? This is my best attempt at portraying an\u00a0exercise that excavates everything of your past. <br/></p>\n<p>Programming, words, game: Isabel Lee (isabellee.me)</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0 Cozy Place by Keys of Moon | https://soundcloud.com/keysofmoon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T17:38:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f91281dfdd5f1f44418f68f225ed9208.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["isabel lee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
