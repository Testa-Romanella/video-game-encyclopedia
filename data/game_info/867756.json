{"id": 867756, "slug": "who-gets-bruiser", "name": "Who Gets Bruiser?", "name_original": "Who Gets Bruiser?", "description": "<p>\u201cWho Gets Bruiser?\u201d is an interactive story about a break-up where players can influence what happens based on their dialogue responses. The game follows our main character Hans as he navigates conversations with his partner, Paul, starting with the first question, \u201cWho Gets Bruiser?\u201d (their dog). The game has multiple endings based on Hans\u2019 responses to Paul and the player will learn new information about the couple as they are transported around different rooms of the house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How will your dialogue choices affect Hans and Paul\u2019s relationship? Do you want them to stay together or do you think they\u2019re better going their separate ways? \u201cWho Gets Bruiser?\u201d attempts to explore the characteristic divide that so many couples face of emotional versus analytical thinking. Contrary to many role playing games we wanted each ending to feel satisfying and justified in its own way, rather than the classic \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d endings.<br/></p>\n<p>Recommended you play the Windows executable if possible but otherwise enjoy in browser!</p>\n<p>\u201cWho Gets Bruiser?\u201d was developed and designed by Harvey Hayman during the six week \"Synthespians\" module while studying at the National Film and Television School.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Design and Development by Harvey Hayman\u00a0</li><li>Script by Alfie Flewitt\u00a0</li><li>Music by Rotem Frimer\u00a0</li><li>Sound Design by Liam Sharpe and Lucas Lehmann\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Voice Artists:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Hans - Paul Herzberg\u00a0</li><li>Paul - Ben Lee\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Playtesters:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Amelia Leuzzi\u00a0</li><li>Ben Knight\u00a0</li><li>Gurpreet Kalsi\u00a0</li><li>Holly Hudson\u00a0</li><li>Lucas Lehmann\u00a0</li><li>Jonny McCausland\u00a0</li><li>Rory Booth\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Alan Thorn\u00a0</li><li>Caroline Webster\u00a0</li><li>Diona Potopea\u00a0</li><li>Ellie Silkstone\u00a0</li><li>Emma Newman\u00a0</li><li>John Dower\u00a0</li><li>Ned Berkin\u00a0</li><li>Ted Chaplin\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Third Party Assets:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Chihuahua by Polyperfect\u00a0</li><li>Dialogue System by Pixel Crushers\u00a0</li><li>Low Poly Props by MagixBox\u00a0</li><li>Paul and Hans 3D Models by Akishaqs\u00a0</li><li>Paul and Hans Animations by Ramsterz\u00a0</li><li>Polygon Town by Synty</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c2/1c28181171591ee08f5b883f8e0107a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["harveyhayman"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
