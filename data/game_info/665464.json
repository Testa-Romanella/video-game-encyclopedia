We unfortunately did not succeed to finish the game in time due to severe overscoping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I put the current version of the game together as a way of salvaging the hard\u00a0 work done by the other team members. Even though it feels a bit disjointed and slow, it was an incredible learning experience and I'm glad to have the game as a keepsake for this cute, charming idea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>STORY</strong><br/><br/>Being a witch does not unfortunately take care of house chores and nobody has more than the young witch at the edge of the swamp. One morning she decides that enough is enough: she's a witch! Why would she have to do chores when she knows magic? Gathering all her knowledge of runes and enchantments, she creates a magical stump to do her bidding. Unfortunately, the stump has no regard for her orders and refuses to do the chores appropriately. The stump quickly steals the witch's hat, broom and cauldron\u00a0(they might be useful after all)\u00a0and goes off to find their own home somewhere in the swamp.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>@Namida Sai: Programming, Animations &amp; VFX</p>\n<p>@Imu: Game Design &amp; Art</p>\n<p>@clonethirteen: Music, Sound, Level Design &amp; Cover Art</p>\n<p>@Lombrix: Art</p>\n<p>@Gabrimud: QA Tester &amp; Additional Art</p>\n<p>@Basil: Additional Programming</p>\n\n<p>Game Engine:<br/><em>Unity 2020.3.11f1 LTS</em></p>\n<p>Fonts: <br/><em>Musicals by Brain Eaters Font Co.
