Find the secret garden, find tranquilty in silence. Frogs have almost 360 vision, and listen with their lungs. Walk around, have a hop. Take in the sights, listen to the change in sounds and eat the \"bugs\" to get a sense of peace and quiet. Programming by Sarah. Art and sound by me. Shared design. Made for IVGD Winter Frogjam 2022. <br/></p>\n<p>Look with mouse. <br/>Click to move. <br/>There is no end, <br/>There is only a secret garden, <br/>There is only silence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/53634524f912a87d7e40107d060648f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steven Steffen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
