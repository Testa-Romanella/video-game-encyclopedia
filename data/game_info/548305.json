In later game jams, I'll definitely look for others to cooperate with. Generic cubes and no sound\u00a0can only get me so far!</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues that I didn't have time to learn to fix (+ temporary solutions for yall):</strong></p>\n<p>* Uncrouching under walls puts the player inside of a wall (crouch again and move to escape)</p>\n<p>* Buggy collisions (try not to move over the hurdles in levels 4 and\u00a06 without being sure you can clear them)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things I want to fix even after the game jam (+ what I plan to try):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>* Player feels floaty (adjusting gravity, but leaving the speed as it is)</p>\n<p>* Little too basic (adding a hidden trophy to collect in each level)</p>\n<p>* Too easy (More levels would make it more difficult since there are fewer tiles)<br/></p><p>*Laggy (I'm not well versed in optimizing 3D games for WebGL, so play carefully)</p>\n<p>If you find any other suggestions regarding programming and generic level design (I can't do much with art/music) then please let me know! This game jam was primarily to get my feet wet, but all constructive criticism is welcome and encouraged.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T05:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/9152964beacf4fd2182b17d823a12be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RocketRaccoon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
