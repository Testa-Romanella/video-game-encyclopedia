I\u00a0recommend posting your score as a screenshot in the comment section ;)</p>\n<p>Game mechanic is about a ball you can move to right to gain points. You can get higher through ramps or jumps. The higher you get, the faster you can move. You only have 60 seconds. Afterwards you can enjoy a time reversal of your try followed by another chance to try it again!<br/></p>\n<p>Game is made with Unity3D. Programming, Art and Music is done by myself.<br/>I used the following Unity Assets: Amplify Shader Editor (for making a custom shader), Amplify Motion (Post-Processing), Beautify\u00a0(Post-Processing). All art assets are just derived from a white circle and a white square, which are modified through the custom shader. The music is blended interactively to the current speed and time left.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29ab84737c4c5d8b894923f04890c934.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["diadas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
