Teaming up with the villain and his army of minions, she aims to take matters into her own hands!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't Save the Princess is an inverted runner in which you control the obstacles instead of the running character. Properly time and combo spikes, smashers, and projectiles in order to slow down Runman level after level. Hold him off for long enough and you'll unlock new dialogue scenes... and maybe Princess Plum will finally get some time to relax.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first version will be a free demo of the first two worlds of the game and is currently still under development.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fefc6cbb1b55d982290d6a799824d36.jpg", "website": "https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sierra Lee"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sierra Lee"], "esrb_rating": null}
