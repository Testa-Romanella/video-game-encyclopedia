Super old teenager project! ]</strong><br/><em> but I thought it would be cool to share it :)</em></p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Ouranos is a very classical shoot-them-up. It's endless, so you can play as long as you want. It's quite an old project, I started it in 2001, but it was redesigned a few times before getting the current form in 2010. For the technical part, it's made in C++ with OpenGL and GLUT. I made the graphics with 3DStudio at that time.</p>\n<p>The title screen is in French, but you don't really need it.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse only controls</li>\n<li>Endless game</li>\n<li>8 different weapons</li>\n<li>Old school scrolling shoot-them-up</li>\n<li>Space background that repeats quite well!</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Mouse to move</li><li>Left click for normal shoot</li><li>Right click for bombs</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b37eb4f56d4478b14ec78338b763419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Oneiric Worlds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
