The player can summon their 3d Joystick at the  <br/>\r\nposition of their hand by using the grip button and choosing from  <br/>\r\nup, down, right, left, forward or backwards. Testing their hand eye<br/>\r\ncoordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVR Memory Cube is the first addition to 3D Joys. Test your memory <br/>\r\nand maybe possibly improve it with a color remembering game like <br/>\r\nthe classic Simon game. Basically, the game is to remember a sequence <br/>\r\nof colors on a cube while each side of the cube will light up different  <br/>\r\ncolors that will resemble your 3D Joystick. Online Leaderboard  <br/>\r\nhas been implemented for the people that want to show off. Offline  <br/>\r\nLeaderboard is also an option. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOculus Rift is the only VR headset I tested this game on. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe future of 3D Joys will depend on its growth because there is  <br/>\r\nonly one person working on this project which is myself and I am <br/>\r\na college dropout student with a Digital Arts Media Certificate. I started <br/>\r\nworking on this project when I had my first Computer Programing class, <br/>\r\nwhere I learned Python and which made me pursue other programming <br/>\r\nlanguages like C#. Unity is the engine that I am using to make this game. <br/>\r\nI am not a professional. I try as hard as I can to bring my vision for <br/>\r\nthis game into fruition and it may take longer than someone that knows <br/>\r\nwhat they're doing but I hope you see the potential and come along the ride <br/>\r\nthat is 3D Joys. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n@WhoDisz", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T06:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d32ed06b7efb5cab6cbf6dc88023e6.jpg", "website": "http://www.3djoys.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3D Joys"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["3D Joys"], "esrb_rating": null}
