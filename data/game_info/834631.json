In many cities, there are more and more games of room escape. People look for clues in the arranged room, open the door, combine the fragmented information, and find out the truth of suspicious or bizarre events. In addition, I have studied architectural design. If I can integrate architectural space design into the game, it may be very interesting. I can make some architectural models and drawings to make the whole game more exquisite and real. Let players enter the deserted buildings from the perspective of an video anchor, encounter a series of events, and finally find the truth and try to survive. I hope there are a lot of props to use in the game, and the lighting effects such as flashlight will also be designed. The scene will also be rendered using the model, and then Photoshop will be used to adjust the atmosphere and make it into pixel style. There are dangerous options in the game, and players need to think carefully and make decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intent and goals in producing game</strong></p>\n<p>I hope to combine the architectural design with the player's game process, so that the player can feel as if he is really exploring in it. If I have more time, I even want to mark on the map and record the process of exploration every time player pass a room or area. I hope to make full use of my knowledge about architecture and combine words to make the narrative of the game more authentic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Building model software</strong></p>\n<p>Sketchup</p>\n<p>Auto CAD</p>\n<p><strong>Painting software</strong></p>\n<p>Photoshop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c391e374150756957d1e2af81416787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NOOKON"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
