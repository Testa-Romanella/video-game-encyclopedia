Press \"escape\" for options to control the intensity of the psychedelic state, and how it alters the sensory experience. In the options, if  you click the \"randomise\" button, it will give you a random set of settings.</p><p>The brain on the left changes its functional activity and connectivity depending on what you do (e.g., if you move, then \"motor\" regions of the brain become active and more connected). As the intensity of the psychedelic state increases, the overall connectivity of the brain increases; brain regions that aren't normally connected become more connected. This increase in connectivity alters the sensory (particularly, visual) experience.</p><p>(This is meant to be illustrative of some of our findings, rather than an accurate portrayal of LSD or of the brain).  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/36739a314bb44e4d464093fd29f5f1a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["leechbrain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
