The project looks at how sound design in video games causes immersion.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In the game you are a detective looking for a group of holiday goers in the village of DunMire. The game is mostly focused on atmosphere and sound design so there isn\u2019t much gameplay other than discovering the bodies and hopefully being immersed in the environments.   </p>\n<p>Please once you have played the game fill out this questionnaire as the results will be used in my thesis.<strong> You will not have to supply any of your personal info , only the answers to the questions will be kept and used in the project.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R68DYF7\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong>  When teleporting to the church there is a chance that you get put back at the door again.
