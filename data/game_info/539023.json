{"id": 539023, "slug": "moon-hopper-xaviergd", "name": "Moon Hopper (XavierGD)", "name_original": "Moon Hopper (XavierGD)", "description": "<p>MoonHopper is a loadout-based deck building game where players must swipe their way through treacherous combat. As a simple salvager, you must defeat the infamous Hand of the Slave Master by acquiring new skills and weapons. Face the Master\u2019s minions by hopping from asteroid to derelict space station, gain credits and buy new assets that will help you on your quest!</p>\n<p>Instructions:\r\nClick on an icon in the world map to start a new combat encounter. Play cards by swiping them to the right. Skip cards by swiping them to the left. Some cards have an Overload: play this ability by swiping the card up.\r\nKeep an eye out for your energy and for the cards in your hand. When either of those run out, it\u2019s the enemies\u2019 turn to attack! Every encounter gives you credits which you can use to buy skills in the Skills tab and new weapons in the Shop (don\u2019t forget to equip them!). Playing five encounters will heal you back to full and offer you a chance to acquire a new card!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T07:07:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["XavierGD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
