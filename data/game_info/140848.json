You have been called in to fix the malls broken escalators. Unfortunately you are up top and the motor is down at the bottom, they are still running, and both are running the same direction, UP! It looks like there is a sale going on, and the mall hasn't closed the escalators. Can you get past all the customers, can you make it to the bottom?</p>\n<p>In this fast paced multi-lane platformer try to stay on the escalator the longest to get the high score. Getting to the bottom is just a pipe dream, as the more time you spend on the escalators the more it escalates quickly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/9993e5f0dd8815298dfbd4e864330424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reflection Rip"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
