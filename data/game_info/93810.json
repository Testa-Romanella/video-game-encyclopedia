They are two peas in a pod, finishing each other's sentences (and each other's food!). Together, they're tasked with caring for a world. Him being the rational, calm and collected of the two and her being the bold and the brave. To both of them, this sounds like a sweet deal. But, is it really?</li><li><em>Aenaris:\u00a0</em>Aenaris is a young princess of a neighboring town, arranged to marry Prince Deren. But with Imre involved, things may not go as planned.\u00a0</li><li><em>Deren:\u00a0\u00a0</em>Deren is a young human prince trying to find his place in his world.
