{"id": 307211, "slug": "skautfold-moonless-knight", "name": "Skautfold: Moonless Knight", "name_original": "Skautfold: Moonless Knight", "description": "Combat:<br/>Fight for your life using the significantly improved real time <strong>Guard System</strong> returning from Usurper; the overhaul of which has created a much deeper and more versatile system than its predecessor. Use your perfectly timed defence to reflect enemy attacks, or a well-timed evasion to create an opening that bypasses the enemy's guard so that you can hit them where it hurts!<br/><br/>The system now rewards wise weapon selection; heavy weapon users will be more rewarded for mastering defence and breaking enemy guard by sheer force, while players using faster weapons will need to employ evasive manoeuvres to follow up on openings. Clash with your enemy as your attacks meet; cancelling both, or in the case of heavy weapons; cause glancing damage to wear down the enemy, or read the enemy's move and attack from the opposite direction to parry them and open them up for a devastating follow-up.<br/><br/>Use the new <strong>Tension</strong> bar to unleash special skills related to your weapon class; build tension passively throughout the fight, or raise it faster by carrying out well-timed actions. These skills will allow you to further enhance your move-set and specialise to your liking. Upgrade your weapons by up to 20 levels; unlocking tension skills and raising their stats.<br/><br/>Level your stats through use. Instead of general exp, each of your 11 stats will increase naturally through use in battle; taking a lot of hard knocks and direct hits will make you tougher, become consistently adept at avoiding attacks and you will level up evasion, swing your favourite weapon type around enough and you will become more efficient at it; causing more damage whilst costing less guard.Exploration:<br/>Forge your own path in a single, deeply interconnected <strong>Metroidvania</strong> light world. Shortcuts, loops, and a tightly woven world await as you explore the Imperial palace; an ominous place with its intimate surroundings and the eldritch secrets that lie below. Uncover the history of the Palace through environmental storytelling, and piece together the dark secrets of the first God Emperor Oda Nobunaga.<br/><br/>Find and rescue allies to recruit for your secret hideout, whilst benefiting from their ability to train you, and unlock your latent potentials. Pick your path and your battles; the world features a semi-open design with multiple paths to your objective, as well as tons of secrets to uncover. Take on bosses in any order you please, find shortcuts and safe-havens in the castle under siege to solidify your foothold and turn the situation in your favour.Story:<br/>In this <strong>Lovecraftian</strong> story, you will take the role of Gray, the 2nd Knight of the Angelic Empire of Britannia, as an envoy sent on a diplomatic mission to the Dawn Empire of Japan. This quickly goes horribly wrong, and Gray has to take responsibility as he finds himself in the midst of a religious coup instigated by the Lunatics; a faction worshipping the Eldritch Moon god. <br/><br/>Soon enough, you will find yourself exploring the Oda Imperial Palace; where you learn about the dark secret that lies below. It is here that you will attempt to fulfil your mission and recover a very special item for which the survival of the entire Empire hinges on. Prepare for an insane ride; as the very moon shall open to reveal the fate of humanity and the unavoidable realisation of our insignificance.<br/><br/>The story follows the events of Shrouded in Sanity, Usurper, and Into the Fray, as the Skautfold series is heading to its conclusion. Knowledge of the previous games is not required to enjoy the game, but it will most certainly make it even more enjoyable.<br/><br/><br/>A quick word from the developer;<br/><strong>Moonless Knight</strong> is the culmination of everything learnt from developing my previous three games. Developing alone may be hard at times, but it allows me to deliver my vision in a complete, uncompromising manner. I hope you will enjoy what I consider to be my best work yet, and I am ever-grateful for your loyal support.<br/>Steve", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/512/5125764ae204b2c2a473053c21ac9823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 60, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steve Gal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pugware"], "esrb_rating": null}
