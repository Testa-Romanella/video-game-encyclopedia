Really!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nOk, not really. As the name implies, it's the <em>corners</em> that matter here. Each corner of your rectangle must be the same color, and there are three different colors and a hundred tiles to choose from. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThen there's the <em>thirty second timer</em>. And there's a <em>square counter</em> that demands a certain number of tiles. And every time you fill it up, it just wants even more. But you only ever have thirty seconds, which isn't a lot of time, so things get exciting pretty quickly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nOh! And did we mention there are <em>Bombs</em>? Because there are bombs. And a bunch of <em>bonuses</em> to help you out along the way. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nRectangles. Bombs. Bonuses. Are you a <em>Corner Master</em>?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBe sure to check out <em>this strategy thread</em> to get yourself a head start in the game!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Boom!\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li><em>Thrilling</em> rectangle creating action!</li>\n<li>An <em>Original Soundtrack</em> featuring <em>Five</em> great songs that slap.</li>\n<li>Never before heard <em>sound effects</em>.</li>\n<li><em>The Voice of the Grid</em>, cheering you on.</li>\n<li>As many as <em>three shades of gray</em>!</li>\n<li>Local <em>high scores</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Bombs</em> that blow up whatever tile color has the most representation on the board.</li>\n<li><em>Special Bonuses</em> like the <em>Instabomb</em> and the <em>Quad Clear</em> to make your job easier.

Rectangle!\r\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\n          \r\n          A diagram labeling important things in the game.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUse the <em>D-Pad</em> to move the selection markers across the grid. Hold the buttons to move quickly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nPress the <em>A Button</em> to turn on <em>Selection Mode</em> to expand the selection markers. When each marker is over a tile of the same color, it will fill in with the color of those tiles.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nPress the <em>A Button</em> again to clear these tiles and collect points.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWhile in <em>Selection Mode</em>, press the <em>B Button</em> to cancel and return to <em>Navigation Mode</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWhen not in <em>Selection Mode</em>, pressing the <em>B Button</em> will use a <em>Bomb</em>, if you have any.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFill the <em>Square Counter</em> to complete a level before time runs out. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nEach time you complete a <em>level</em>, you'll be granted another <em>Bomb</em>. You can also get a <em>Bonus Bomb</em> by making a rectangle that contains <em>all of the tiles on the grid</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe <em>Square Counter</em> will reset, and grow by two rows (38 additional tiles). Any overage from your last clear will be included when it resets.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nMake <em>rectangles</em> that have <em>bonus tiles in their corners</em> to take advantage of their benefits. Bonuses will stack with one another. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Making a rectangle and advancing to level 3\r\n\r\nBonus Tiles\r\n<p>\n<em>BONUS TILES ONLY APPLY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE CORNERS!</em>\n</p>\n<em>Double Clears</em> multiply the number of tiles in your clear by two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Quad Clears</em> multiply the number of tiles in your clear by four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Instabombs</em> immediately remove all tiles of the color of the clear from the grid. Two or more in a match will blow up the entire grid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Time Warps</em> add an additional five seconds to the clock for each one in a corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs mentioned, bonuses will stack. So, for example, if your rectangle has two <em>Quad Clears</em>, you are effectively getting an <em>8x clear</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Two double clears turning 30 tiles into 120.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIgnoring <em>bonus tiles</em> and <em>combo opportunities</em> will ensure a very quick presentation of the Game Over Screen.\r\n</p>\r\nGame Over\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Game Over\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe game will end if the <em>Timer</em> runs out before you are able to satisfy the <em>Square Counter's</em> requirements. \r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the <em>A Button</em> to turn on <em>Selection Mode</em>, and press it again to confirm a selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <em>B Button</em> can be used to <em>Cancel Selection Mode</em> and return to <em>Navigation Mode</em>. When in <em>Navigation Mode</em>, pressing the <em>B Button</em> will fire off a <em>Bomb</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the <em>D-Pad</em> to move the <em>Selection Markers</em> while in <em>Navigation Mode</em>, and to expand them while in <em>Selection Mode</em>. Hold the buttons down to move quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          An Instabomb\r\n\r\n\r\n      How to Install the Game\r\n      <p>\r\n      Not sure how to sideload games onto your Playdate?
