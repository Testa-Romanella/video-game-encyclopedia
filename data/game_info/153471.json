Desktop web-browsers only.</p><p>This is a game I was building by myself in Flash-  All the animations are done on the main timeline and it quickly turned into a beast.  I wanted to make a game my kids could play, and this did the trick.  The problem was, they would play it for a minute or two, then want to switch to angry birds or something else.  Given that I could not hold their attention very long and my file was getting hard to work with... I decided to shelf this game.</p><p>I may at some point re-visit and do all the animations in Spine and maybe throw it together in Unity, but only if I can find a way to hold their attention longer and make it more engaging to kids. Mini games or something maybe?</p><p>My favorite thing to do is tickle Scraggles belly. :)</p><p>My little brother Zac (aka Ratkissa on soundcloud) did all of the music.</p><p>For now it shall collect dust.</p><p>Sorry for the awkward size- it was sized to fit the blackberry playbook :)  Thats what my kids all had at the time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe2ce678a3bdf2f8d8f54db0887215f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haddy22"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
