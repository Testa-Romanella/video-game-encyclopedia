Follow the questline to beat the game a survival of the apocalypse. We also stripped some unnecessary features players didn't use and felt overwhelmed by, and also\u00a0reworked the combat system to provide a more smooth gameplay with hitmarkers, collider tweaks, health regeneration and a few other features. In addition to this. the car physics were refined once again due to player feedback. Speaking of player feedback, we received a lot saying our game wasn't \"juicy\" enough, so we hit that hard. From new sound effects to new buildings our game looks far better and is much more developed in terms of graphics and environmental feel. We plan to add more juice with minimap improvement\u00a0while improving the storyline next week to provide more direction and feel to the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T06:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c8f2be59bcc89191ae11d1a92e580b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["khatib"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
