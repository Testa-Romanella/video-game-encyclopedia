Our lives are full of difficult decisions. And one of the most tried-and-true methods for making those tough decisions is a quick game of Rock Paper Scissors, also known as Roshambo.</p>\n<p>But for some, Roshambo is more than a way to decide who gets to eat the last french fry. It's more than just a game--it's a <em>lifestyle</em>. For these street-wise warriors, the spirit of Roshambo is in the air they breathe, the clothes they wear, and the words they speak. They don't just play Rock Paper Scissors; they play <strong>Roshambo Rumble</strong>.</p>\n<p>This game was created from start to finish in one 40-hour work week (Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm) as a personal game development challenge.
