Feel like a real trucker who is driving a big trash truck. Sit behind the steering wheel of realistic garbage truck on city streets by transporting the trash in challenging 20 driver levels. It's time to get behind the wheel of a garbage truck!  It doesn't stop there! Once you are done collecting the trash around town, you then need to find the special parking zone to park your big garbage truck! As you know waste collection is a part of the process of waste management. It is the transfer of solid waste from the point of use and disposal to the point of treatment or landfill. Waste collection also includes the curbside collection of recyclable materials that technically are not waste, as part of a municipal landfill diversion program.<br/><br/>This garbage truck or dustbin lorry is a truck specially designed for you to collect municipal solid waste and haul the collected waste to a solid waste treatment facility such as a landfill. Other common names for this type of truck include trash truck and rubbish truck, bin wagon, dustcart, bin lorry or bin van and many other names in different parts of the world. Play as a truck driver of waste collection vehicle and refuse collection vehicle in the big city environment.<br/><br/>This big truck is equipped with automated forks on the front which the driver carefully aligns with sleeves on the waste container which is a container for temporarily storing waste, and is usually made out of wrought iron or plastic. That can be called as a dustbin, rubbish bin, litter bin, trash can, trash bin, dumpster, waste basket, waste paper basket, waste receptacle, container bin, bin, kitchen bin, barrel and trash barrel using a joystick or a set of levers. The waste container is then lifted over the truck. Once it gets to the top the container is then flipped upside down and the waste or recyclable material is emptied into the vehicle's hopper. Once the waste is dumped, it is compacted by a hydraulically powered moving wall that oscillates backwards and forwards to push the waste to the rear of the vehicle. When the body is full, the compaction wall moves all the way to the rear of the body, ejecting it via an open tailgate. There is also a system called the Curotto Can which is an attachment for a front loader that has an automated arm that functions as an automated side loader that allows the driver to dump carts.<br/><br/>Features:<br/> <br/>Ultimate trash truck to drive<br/>20 levels of extreme truck challenges fun in this mega dump cleaner<br/>Multiple camera views to enhance experience with real physics<br/>Marvelously HD levelheaded graphics<br/>Responsive interface with smooth controls", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/4208237de646f685bd3c805b8a837db9.jpg", "website": "http://www.ozitechnology.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Techving"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Techving"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
