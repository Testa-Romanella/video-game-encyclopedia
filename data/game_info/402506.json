{"id": 402506, "slug": "stargate-1995", "name": "Stargate (1995)", "name_original": "Stargate (1995)", "description": "<p>Stargate is a Sega Mega Drive action game based on the film with the same name. In Japan, it had been scheduled to be released in May 1995, but was canceled just before.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is typical of the sidescrolling, platform games of the era. The player controls Colonel Jack O\u2019Neil and navigates him through the various locations by walking/running, jumping and climbing. O\u2019Neil\u2019s health is indicated by an energy bar found alongside information such as weapon status and grenade count on the heads-up display. Most missions consist of finding people or items in one of several different locations. There are two missions that involve flying one of Ra\u2019s gliders and partaking in dogfight style combat. The radio screen displays the player\u2019s current mission, as well as other information such as the number of lives, continues, hieroglyphs, bomb pieces, and current password.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/044a7e1bcbb1cad3b79cccf88bb4927c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["SNES", "Genesis", "Game Gear", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["Probe Entertainment", "Tantalus Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
