Will you get the signal out in time, or will this be the end of life as we know it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Destruction Disruption is a game where you must fix a broken radio transmitter using parts you find around the room. Some of these fixes will be straightforward, whereas others may require a slightly more creative approach. You will have to think fast, because if the transmitter isn't broadcasting before the timer runs out, it will be too late to stop the missile, and humanity will be doomed.</p>\n<p>This is a slightly improved version of a game\u00a0created in 48 hour for the Global Game Jam 2020 with the theme of 'repair'.
