Steal Presents, stop the gift production and even sabotage Santa's Sleigh.</p>\n<p>I developed this project in Unity for a University assignment. I modelled and textured the majority of the low-poly assets.\u00a0I implemented a robust architecture in Unity, adopting an event system to remove dependencies. I also developed my own player controller using the new Unity Input System,\u00a0\u00a0with material-specific footstep sounds. I also produced a simple conveyor belt system to move the present assets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept of a rebellious elf sabotaging Christmas is interesting to me, and I would enjoy developing the concept further into a game about an elf infiltrating Santa's workshop and undermining him - only to realize your own protagonist is deluded and unjustifiably sabotaging Christmas.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/6093157d6a5823c5bb126180697825ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Hutchinson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
