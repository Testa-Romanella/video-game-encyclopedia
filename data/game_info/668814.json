While I wasn't even close to finishing my initial concept, I'm proud of what I did get done and I think it at least shows what I was going for.</p>\n<p>The idea is to create a game in the tycoon genre, like Roller Coaster Tycoon, where you manage an MMO world. This includes designing and building the world, managing business costs, and responding to player feedback. I was inspired by a developer who is currently a few years into developing exactly this kind of game.
