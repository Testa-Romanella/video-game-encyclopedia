I got the feedback from people saying that the game was too easy, because you could just stay on the bouncy balls and survive that way.\u00a0 Along with that I\u00a0got the comments that the platforms were a bit too random, which just made the game worse to play. I tried to make the game work a little better by having the bouncy balls dissapear like some platforms, and place more platforms in general, but honestly I'm not proud of this one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T10:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d4593858a06b3b3502655b11bde76d0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dunne2"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
