Score by deflecting the disco balls into your color goal! The first party to 11 wins!</p>\n<p>Only two of the eight parties are controllable by players at the moment, and both players have to use the same computer:</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 controls the pink paddle via the Left/Right arrow keys.</li><li>Player 2 controls the aqua paddle via the A/D keys.</li><li>The other paddles are controlled by AIs.</li><li>If either Player 1 or Player 2 isn't playing, the AI opposite them will probably win. If you're playing by yourself, maybe try controlling both Players 1 &amp; 2 simultaneously and see how you fare!</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Made in 4 days for the \"GMC Jam 40\" Game Jam.
