The composer Nykia and I (Dr. B.A. Ferguson) came up with the premise, and the game was made with VNMaker (and its assets). The backgrounds were from Neeka of OBP (https://itch.io/profile/neeka-of-obp). <em>A Walk in the Park\u00a0</em>follows Rosa as they meet their childhood friend Dario in the park. They have not seen each other in a long time, and something seems off... The game has three endings in all: a \"good\" ending, a \"neutral\" ending, and a \"bad\" ending. See if you can get all three!</p>\n<p>Design by Dr. B.A. Ferguson (@Ferguson_music)</p>\n<p>Music by Nykia Osborne (@NykiaO)</p>\n<p>Rosa's Voice by insomnaleptic (@insomnaleptic)</p>\n<p>Dario's Voice by Favian Streat (@fstreat02)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T06:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcdaab94c97828c693aa27e9ef8bbb8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dr. B.A. Ferguson", "insomnaleptic", "fstreat02", "NykiaO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
