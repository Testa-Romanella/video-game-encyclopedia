It is inhabited by various peoples ruled by the old royal dynasty for 200 years.<br/><br/> What an interesting start!<br/><br/> Yeah, but it\u2019s gonna be even cooler! As time passed, magic and science developed in Caravella, the island turned into a real country and became a beautiful rose of the world when suddenly a real evil appeared there! It was born as a child of darkness and strengthened from year to year, until it decided to capture Caravella.<br/><br/> ...<br/><br/> The monsters became a tool of evil and began to deplete the newly flourishing island, killing and robbing its inhabitants. This went on for ten years, and even the capital fell under the onslaught of enemies!<br/><br/> Someone has to stand up to the monsters!<br/><br/> That\u2019s right, it's at this time the people on the island are waking up from the fear and the inaction and starting to decide the fate of their country. They will become the future heroes in my fantasy.<br/><br/> But who are they?<br/><br/> Oh, this is a team of four brave guys and girls who will raise the peoples of Caravella to war with monsters at the will of the king and at the call of their hearts.<br/><br/> What are their names and what are they capable of, Harold?<br/><br/> It's not easy to tell everything, but the team has a common purpose...<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> They can't handle monsters individually with such skills\u2026<br/><br/> Yes, but together they have a chance to save their country. The more interesting their adventure is!<br/><br/> I agree.
