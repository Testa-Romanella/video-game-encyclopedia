And Hanukkah!</p>\n<p>This game was made in unity and inspired by old school fps such as Doom and Wolfenstein. I started \"working\" on this about a month ago, but I have only really worked for a week, so sorry if it looks rushed, because it is.\u00a0Everything here is also hand made except for the music which I got from\u00a0DL sounds.\u00a0Special thanks to GamesPlusJames who provided a tutorial series to help me make it,\u00a0 so\u00a0 I will link it at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<p>The game is about a normal Christmas eve when Santa Claus calls you to say he forgot 100 of his presents. It is your job, as Santa's Lil' Helper, to defeat the grinches, snowmen, gingerbread, and reindeer, to get the presents back and safely return them to the magic Gift bag.</p>\n<p>Controls and mechanics:</p>\n<p>Coca Cola gives you health and trees give you ammo.</p>\n<p>WASD to move and left mouse to shoot.</p>\n<p>tutorial series for anyone interested:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d31674b0a851be10b2420b95338a36ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FilipFlop"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
