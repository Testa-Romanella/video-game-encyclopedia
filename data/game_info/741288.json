Talk about your feelings with someone who will listen.  It's okay to be as sad as you feel around her. She won't push you away for being a broken mess of a person, unless you're cruel.\u00a0 and even then, you can try again once it's all over. so don't focus on saying the right things and getting the right responses. just talk. just date.<br/></p>\n<p>Less a game and more a loose conglomeration of thoughts about life and mental health held together with ductape and prayers.</p>\n<p>--4 dates. each takes like...3? 5 minutes? very short.</p>\n<p>--32 bit compatible</p>\n<p>--chill music<br/></p>\n<p>IF YOU ARE PRONE TO PANIC ATTACKS AT THE DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN ISSUES, PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>known bugs:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>for some reason there's a glitch where you get stuck on the first date after completing it, even though the game acknowledges that you've already been on the date. I honestly have no idea why this happens, so I can't fix it. so far, closing the game and reopening it when the bug happens fixes it and lets you continue on as normal. idk man coding is just building a jenga tower and hoping to fuck it stays up. if anyone has any idea why this happens, please contact me so I can fix it I hate not being able to.</p>\n<p>please tell me if you find any other bugs! I playtested it. other people playtested it. i looked through the code again and again<strong><em>. people still make mistakes</em></strong>. please tell me if you find any!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T11:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a30d92ac80b2e8b0bedbe5ecc9473e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PissFuck-McShitcunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
