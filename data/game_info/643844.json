Unfortunately I was NOT able to create this game in under 3 hours. I am so sorry that I had to go over time :(. My official time was:</p>\n<p>4 Hours, 58 Minutes, and 36 Seconds</p>\n<p>I was really hoping for the theme \"Voices Lead the Way,\" but I still think genetics wasn't too bad either!</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam! I gave myself further limitations: work within a NES color pallet. Some of the assets (like the checkered background, the original frog sprite, and the music) were already created by me before hand, but everything else was created during the jam. Everything within the game was created by me, with the exception of the fonts used, which are royalty free!</p>\nCONTROLS:Click &amp; DragSelects a frogEscQuits the game\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\n<p>Attempt to get the goal frog shown in the upper left hand corner by using the frogs on your right. The current frog that you have with all the genes you have created will display in the middle.</p>\n<p>In order to start, drag 2 frogs together. From then on, if you want to add genes to your already existing frog, drag it to the middle.</p>\n<p>If you want to reset, drag 2 frogs back together and the one in the center will change to match the new combination!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1aac2eae35c785eb59b47053f64b8f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["NeverEnd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
