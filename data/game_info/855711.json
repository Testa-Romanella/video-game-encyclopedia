These guys are not square, so it would be easy to spot them\u2026 or so I thought, but finding such chameleons on a disco dance floor in a dark shady club turned out to be a real pain!</p>\n<p>Should I make three mistakes, the bouncers get rid of me. I also had limited time to act. But\u2026 there seemed to be an endless stream of ever bigger nightclubs\u2026</p>\n<p>[<em>Where\u2019s Waldo?</em>, with a twist.]<br/></p>\n<p>Made with Love2D.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Just the mouse! Light up the scene and click on the right suspects</strong>.</li><li>Esc: quit</li><li>P: pause</li><li>Space: begin / try current level again</li></ul>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>The \u2018chameleons\u2019 sometimes use the colour of another area; I could not pinpoint the origin of this bug, as things seem to go well with few chameleons, and this happens when there are more. Perhaps changing the colour mode too often (with setColor) does this, but this would be weird, since colour stays absolutely correct or the hats and glasses\u2026 Still, the game feels playable and hard enough even with this!</li><li>In the navigator version: the love.js fullscreen mode (using the lower-left button) seems not to have the keyboard respond (at least for me under Firefox), only the mouse; nevertheless, <strong>the itch.io fullscreen mode (using the lower-right button) works</strong>.</li></ul>\r\nCreation context\r\n<p> <em>Made for Mini Jam 115 with theme <strong>\u2018Noir\u2019</strong> and limitation <strong>\u2018Everything is Temporary\u2019</strong>.

Reusing the torch from <em>Enquiquineur</em> (a shader I had in fact written for another previous test game in Love2D).
