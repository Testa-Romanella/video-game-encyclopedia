HU3 can\u2019t stop so it\u2019s up to Dave to keep driving. Players must battle between virus' appearing on their windscreen and not crashing the car they are driving. Complete simple tasks to keep your view clear but ignore them and it won\u2019t be so easy to see where you\u2019re going.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75f9b2c0c7c1f19ddcf5d38f4fe690be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coopah"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
