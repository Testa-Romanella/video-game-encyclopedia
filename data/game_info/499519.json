I have found the game development passion while making this game, from coding to game design. So even just having you guys experiment it, would be a great honour for me. About the game, basically it is a simple 3D platformer, where you have to control a ball from point A to B, the catch is that there is a \"storm\", therefore the name \"Royale\" and also a timer to register you best time. This is a prototype from what could be a party \"rage\" game. Leave me feedback!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511d92e1d72d8a94d1b2bc8be6bd2f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dyjutsen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
