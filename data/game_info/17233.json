{"id": 17233, "slug": "black-forest", "name": "Black Forest", "name_original": "Black Forest", "description": "Black Forest is a turn-based multiplayer game about cooperation and betrayal. A resource-management strategy game about survival and despair. It is set in the dark and dangerous Black Forest in medieval Germany. It is a casual game, meaning that you will spend anywhere from a few minutes to maybe half an hour per day, with a game possibly running for several weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game, each player controls one family in a village that is located deep in the forest. Everyone tries to survive the wolves, bears and worse that come at night. Plant and harvest, gather and build, cooperate and betray. Survive as a community, but do not forget about yourself. Try to survive the coming winter to win the game. Or simply be the last survivor to gain a personal victory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core element of the game is cooperation and its limits. At some point, you have to think of yourself first. If your community is strong, others will help you. But the forest will sooner or later overwhelm you all - when will cooperation break down? Will people betray openly, or trick? Is that proposal a trick maybe, or really the best? What role will common ground play? Does the village provide shelter for those who lost their homes? Do you share resources or keep them private? All of these and many other questions will be asked and answered in every game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T10:51:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9695ee76241e092c01c9d7d38999742c.jpg", "website": "http://blackforest.lemuria.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 169}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lemuria"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games", "Lemuria"], "esrb_rating": null}
