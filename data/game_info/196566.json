{"id": 196566, "slug": "three-in-one", "name": "Three in One", "name_original": "Three in One", "description": "<p>The game we made is called \u201cThree in One\u201d (a play on match 3 + 1 mechanic). We built the game in Unity. The mechanic we focused on is Tapping. The only way the player interacts with the game is to tap on a brick to change it to another brick. To help the players understand what the brick will change into, we added a key at the top of the level. Matches are only made after the player spends all of their current \u201cTaps\u201d for the round. The number of rounds a player is given changes with each level. Also each round can change the key that the player is using. This helps spice up the gameplay and can lead to some really fun planning on the harder levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Design: Derrick Powell</p>\n<p>Code: Tanner Johnson</p>\n<p>Art: Tina Zhang-Powell</p>\n<p>Music: Victor Hallock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/478a45e709403e7c80ba4332edfb398b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["poqa_tj"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
