It should still be possible to play it to one of multiple endings. Unfortunately that means no items to find and use, no multiple paths up the mountain, no minigames instead of just clicking buttons,\u00a0and very few events.</p><p>Mobile support also had to be cut, which is kind of sad because the type of game would fit quite well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f59e33a31c6b895a6ec240e5d644c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["senritsu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
