This game is made using really generic assets to annoy you even more. Even the dev just made this in like 10 mins. Ok fine i'll start exaggerating now; This is\u00a0a very basic endless runner game where the\u00a0<strong>platforms are generated randomly</strong>\u00a0and the player has to move to prevent being pushed outside the screen. There is also a\u00a0<strong>score system</strong>\u00a0which updates the score when the player is in action.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is beany. He is stupid enough to infinitely run these random blocks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the main character that we, the user, will be controlling. The player sprite can only \u201cJump\u201d to avoid the obstacles and to stay inside the screen. It has\u00a0<strong>Idle</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Run</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Jump</strong>\u00a0animations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a platform.\u00a0These are the moving blocks that the Player Sprite has to avoid. These blocks will be encountered by the player randomly.</p>\n<p>That's it :) This game was made in the GDevelop Game Engine! Thanks for checking it out!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7a53aa95d144a850a850756da854fa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zylops"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
