Feel the breath of nature in the dense virgin forest; feel the different scenery in the dark and deep alien star. At the same time in the game, you can adjust the speed of the roller coaster. You can stop on the way to further experience a different style, and at the same time, you can observe the flying posture of the dinosaurs and the appearance of the local terrain at close range, or you can adjust the speed to the maximum and feel the wind passing through various terrain.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T06:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd806325569786e0c4a3021f7da43d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VR RETRO REMASTER"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["VR RETRO REMASTER"], "esrb_rating": null}
