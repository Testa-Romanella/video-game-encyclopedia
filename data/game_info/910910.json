Different combat options require\u00a0player\u00a0input to match a certain instrument, and have effects in battle proportional to rhythm accuracy. This project aims to recreate the feeling of shredding on someone in real life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rhythm functionality\u00a0based on processing csv files containing midi data, made possible with MIDICSV by John Walker</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>[Esc] - close the game</p>\n<p>[F] - toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p>[Space] - Player 1 input</p>\n<p>[Enter] - Player 2 input</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>1.

A note-display bar will appear on the screen as a guide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<p>Long notes (longer than 2 beats)\u00a0need to be held out for their whole duration, while shorter notes only require a tap at the start of the note.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your chosen instrument isn't playing at the time of input, you will have no effect. Be smart about when to choose attacks based on the state of the song.</p>\n<p>Bug: some parts of the song have missing note data, likely due to bad file processing / bad input data. The note display will be empty at those times and\u00a0no rhythm input will be registered.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>5.
