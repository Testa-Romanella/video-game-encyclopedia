You've slept in, and missed the start of the match! Rush to work, jump on your ride-on mower, and start cutting the grass whilst the game is in progress! Don't run over any of the players though, or you'll leave a nasty stain. Cut as much of the grass as you can before the match finishes, and go for the high score!</p><p>This game was made as a result of the Guildford Game Jammers Awesome Sports Jam of 2016.
