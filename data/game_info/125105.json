If you feel this is small enough to be a \"bug fix\" judge by the easier 1.01 version, otherwise use the 1.00 version. </p><p>UPDATE 2:</p><p>I added a \"Jam\" version 1.02 that defaults even more easier steering than version 1.01, as well as the possibility to toggle back to 1.00 and 1.01 steering if wanted. This version also changes the geometry slightly so that there's less risk that the first thing you do is get stuck in a corner.</p><p>Other tips for the turning is to start turning one way, then turn the other way to compensate for the force - it is meant to be a bit hard in the beginning in return for being more satisfying after you get it.</p><p>Here's the main music theme I did, I was going for a WipeOut vibe: https://soundcloud.com/neontropics/zroomers-main-t...</p><p>FURTHER CHANGELOG:</p><p>v1.03: fixed bug where it doesn't restart after all checkpoints unless you beat your personal best time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1b6006753148cacfd39619fea4d2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["neontropics"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
