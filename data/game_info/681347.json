I also added asteroids in the playing field to make the player more aware and I changed the skin of the enemies in order to make them more different than each other and to represent the difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/856/85626d00ec136effdd700915117ad6d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RMCF4life10"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
