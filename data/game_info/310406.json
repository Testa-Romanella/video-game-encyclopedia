There was a time when the passing of time in a game was dependent on the computer's processing power. As technology progressed, these games became unplayable; faster processors meant faster moving\u00a0<em>everything</em>. These games quickly became\u00a0forgotten artifacts of the history of video games.</p><p>In\u00a0<em>Frameskip</em>, everytime you complete the level, you start over. The difference is that everything becomes faster: inputs are more sensitive, music accelerates, the player and\u00a0<em>Gille le monstre</em> move faster. You do not lose because <em>Gille le monstre</em>\u00a0 catches up with you.\u00a0You lose because technology catches up with the game.</p>\n<p><strong>The unclean code of <em>Frameskip</em> is\u00a0available on GitHub.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11ab9148707e8c48f20d6930c5273153.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bodro", "qw3rtyuu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
