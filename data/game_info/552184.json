It is designed mainly around 1st person with the third person being a unique solution to have both without changing the behavior or the controller. The main view can be easily changed in the source code but that isn't available in the demo. The gun aims where the first person camera is aiming and the third person camera aims at where the gun is aiming.</p>\n<p>ctrl - crouch</p>\n<p>space - jump</p>\n<p>shift - wall run</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/267de02e36dd7a903e9b033fb7eb1064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BoshBoyBinton"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
