You would be paying $3.00 for a 5 second experience. If you do buy it, you can duplicate it, so theoretically you paid $3.00 for 100 (or more!) copies of this doorbell game and that's kind of neat.</p>\n\n<p>Ps: The doorbell is very precise when you try to click it\u00a0so it's easy to miss.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39143aebceb6be8fbc61a0941d3dbdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Earl Cox III"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
