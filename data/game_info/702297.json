Here you have to build an economy and various defense towers to resist hordes of aliens.<br/><br/>To do this, you can choose various strategies, such as abandoning the economy to quickly build up defenses, building up the entire map with simple but cheap towers, or erecting several, but very strong and sturdy improved towers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the towers cannot cope with the hordes of UFOs or one cunning alien was able to slip through, then you can use various elemental super-strikes.<br/><br/>In the game you will find many different levels, both in construction and visual, from steppes and glaciers to hell! And also plunge into a pleasant, but sometimes tense atmosphere, accompanied by a cute soundtrack.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Good luck to you earthling to prove to those who came from above that we are not simple and the Earth belongs to us for a reason!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11c/11c257f654a662f4ef64a3d2a469a661.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/pieceofvoxel", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
