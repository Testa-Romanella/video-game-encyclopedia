Drive well and earn a medal on a course to unlock the next.\u00a0 Each course is more challenging that the previous. Scoring follows traditional autocross standards.\u00a0 Hitting a cone adds two (2) seconds to your total time.\u00a0 Going the wrong direction around a course element results in a DNF (did-not-finish, or did-not-follow course).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although this can be played in a web browser, your best experience will be to download the game and run from your local PC.\u00a0The PC build offers support for keyboard, gamepad, and steering wheel controls.\u00a0 The web build may not recognize a steering wheel controller.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, and as such I welcome your feedback and suggestions for features that should be included in a final game.\u00a0 Here is the short list of what I have planned for the future of this project:</p>\n<ul><li>Multiple cars including FWD, RWD, and AWD drivetrains.</li><li>A thorough tutorial sequence.</li><li>A full regional season with multiple courses.</li><li>A full divisional season with multiple courses and two-day scoring.</li><li>Two-day scoring for two national-style courses.</li><li>User-defined input key binding.</li><li>Inclusion of driver aids and suspension management.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8cab1950efa396457d405fd9b39d356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["J.
