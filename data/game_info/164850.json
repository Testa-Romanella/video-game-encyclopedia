Desktop is mouse control, mobile is tilt control.<br/>2. Touching any other dot results in a game over.<br/>3. After some amount of time, your dot will be charged, indicated by turning green and a sound effect.<br/>4. While charged, click and hold to put out your spikes. You can have your spikes out for 5 seconds. <br/>5. Touching another dot while spikey will pop that dot.<br/>6. The resulting explosion can pop other dots for a chain reaction.<br/>7. You do not earn points until the chain ends. The points you earn is the number of explosions squared.<br/>8. Your dot grows a bit every time a dot explodes. Be careful of getting too big.<br/>9. Move your dot towards the edge of the screen to shrink and end the chain early.<br/>10. Some dots will also have spikes. Any dots with spikes are invincible while their spikes are out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d4fd1044ee670c2a69a975f7f45f510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["obachuka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
