Buchanan)", "description": "<p><em>You walk past the old subway entrance every morning on your way to school. The tracks were torn up when your parents were children; the tunnels blocked with rubble, the few remaining stations boarded up. Now the entrance is covered in thick layers of graffitti and posters. Pigeons roost on the metal frame above, barely noticed between the take-out sushi and the new vape shop.</em></p>\n<p><em>Except for today.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Sidetrack</em> you're a teenager who stumbles on an urban railway network that\u00a0<em>shouldn't be there</em>. Explore at your own pace, changing lines, choosing which stations to stop at, and gathering items which can affect your journey\u00a0at other points. No winning or losing - when you are done, find your way back to the place you boarded.</p>\n<p><em>Sidetrack</em> is played in the browser, and best played on at least a laptop sized screen, though it does function on mobile. High contrast and dark mode themes are available.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T07:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b90/b90e2f3eed70b277ef89000fc7f1e0b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andi C.
