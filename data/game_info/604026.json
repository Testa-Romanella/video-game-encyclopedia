It's available in early access starting Spring 2021. The full version of the game is set to be released Summer 2021.<h3>Themes</h3>Through it's narrative, Incel Syndrome explores misogynist currents within contemporary internet-culture. It contrasts them against the theories of Otto Weininger, a young Austrian philosopher who tragically ended his life in 1903, shortly after completing a 500-page treatise on male-female relations.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Incel Syndrome is an interactive visual novel. The player is able to freely explore two timelines. The PRESENT, which documents Sam's current interactions and activities. And the PAST, a manifesto-style account of his life until the present day. At the end of the game both timelines converge in an unprecedented display of phantasmagoric apotheosis.<h3>Controls</h3><ul><li>Progress: [Space]<br/></li><li>Enter/Exit Menu: [Esc]<br/></li><li>Select choice: [Mouse]<br/></li><li>Full Screen: [Alt] + [Enter]</li></ul><br/>Produced by S.O.C.A.H<br/>Character art by Hezolnut", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T03:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edb92ade42e5b92a6d82ce50582e1bb.jpg", "website": "https://www.socah.org/incelsyndrome", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["socah development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["socah"], "esrb_rating": null}
