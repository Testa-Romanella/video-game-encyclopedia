There are levels where it is required to solve tasks so unobvious that it seems that the game can not be passed.</p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Locations are four, and in each location there are ten levels. More precisely, eleven - after the tenth location of each level you will meet with the boss.</p>\n<h3>Bosses</h3>\n<p>Bull. In addition to the Bull, boxes with explosives are still falling here. On the other hand, the boxes fall on the Bull too, which can be the key to victory.<br />\nCoyote. Coyote - not the only trouble at its level. Exploding boxes are present here, but in the company of traps and other troubles. The strategy here is about the same - apply all these troubles against the boss.<br />\nSnowman. It acts on the player by the wind and snowballs. A player can throw fireballs at Snowman.<br />\nDevil. The devil is not easy to win. The battle stretches for five episodes. First you need to catch the Devil, dodging meteorite rain - it happens in space. Then we fight with him. In the third, fourth and fifth episodes we fight the Devil in his house - in hell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/37642a7bf967b5490b813d1c20d7f7ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.97, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 1108, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 34}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 67, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 67, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Elias Viglione", "Tomi Maarela"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Panic Art Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
