As a former FLASH game developer, I began learning UNITY after FLASH was phased out. This is my first UNITY game. Therefore, please understand that there are many imperfections and bugs. Treat it as a practice, and I believe the next version will be more polished.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Overview:<br/>\r\nThis game is a 2D side-scrolling shooter played from a third-person perspective. It allows single-player gameplay with a keyboard and mouse, as well as local multiplayer with up to 4 gamepad players and 1 keyboard and mouse player, making it perfect for family parties. During the game, you can use a radio to call AI-controlled teammates to join your squad. Players can switch control between squad members, who each have customizable appearances, individual equipment systems, and backpacks. Items can be exchanged between team members. The base contains many cabinets for storing various supplies and equipment, and vehicles have trunks for item storage.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInstead of traditional health bars, human characters in the game have basic needs such as hunger, thirst, fatigue, and sleep. They bleed, get angry, scared, and can self-heal when injured. The physical condition of characters, such as bleeding and injury treatment, is visibly reflected on them, and they become progressively weaker, eventually crawling or fainting. Use bandages to stop bleeding and medicine for recovery, or sleep to regain health. I am thrilled to have finally implemented the ragdoll physics system in Unity, something I always wanted to do in FLASH development.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVehicles in the game can be found as transportable wrecks, which can be placed on a vehicle repair station to be fixed and used. Vehicle appearances can be customized, and they come equipped with weapons and a trunk for storing ammunition and other items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game eschews the concept of money. Necessary resources are produced at various workbenches in the base, and the types of items that can be produced are researched in the base's research lab. While initially intended to have a sandbox feel, it has been simplified to its current state.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game's objective is to manage your squad members in the base to produce materials needed for combat, arm yourselves as much as possible, expand your team, and prepare firearms, melee weapons, grenades, armor, backpacks, and vehicles. Stay in good health because, with each night, more and more zombies will attack. You will control your squad to defend and strike out from the base of the A-troop until all are killed in battle. New A-troop soldiers will then arrive by helicopter to take over the base and continue the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor those interested in more customization and modification options, a DLC modifier is available for purchase, offering enhanced customization features for battles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T12:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/4129c91227f5e68b0667d9df9954acf1.jpg", "website": "http://AndyLaw.Games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andy Law"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Andy Law"], "esrb_rating": null}
