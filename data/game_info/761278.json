The assignment consisted of creating a top-down 2D game in the JRPG style within 9 weeks using GB Studio. Unfortunately I ran out of time to complete the full game, but Part 1 is completely playable with a *mysterious* cliffhanger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My favorite aspect in the creation of Prodigal Daughters was designing the narrative and writing dialogue, but I also had a blast making pixel art and doing level design. Besides using some example character sprites (courtesy of Chris Maltby), I also created all of the artwork.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope to one day complete Prodigal Daughters for a full, unified narrative experience!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong><br/>To move =\u00a0WASD<br/>Press button = J</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T08:24:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50d/50db44b10ee270fa64774cee887f4dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brooklyn Vander Wel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
