Currently the game has the following:</p>\n<p>_5 Cards to pick from for your deck.</p>\n<p>_A slime fight (he can slam you around or just put you to bed, it's a gamble.)</p>\n<p>_A basic system for character customization with 5 Hair styles, 5 eyes and glasses, and five mouths, that you can mix to you're heart's content.</p>\n<p>_3 Stats to affect your deck, and thus, your chances of winning. <em>(I forgot to use \"Speed\" in anything, so technically it's only two stats)</em></p>\n<p>_and... well that's kinda it so far.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>If you have fun with it please consider leaving a rating, or maybe donating, if you feel like it... no pressure really.... I don't care... (This is how you play hard to get... right...?)</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Seriously though, thanks for playing. Let me know if I can improve or add something.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/1375821df70d84ffc75b0f64f5809a19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aroyaki"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
