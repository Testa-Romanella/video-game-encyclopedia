Try to save up for more expensive seeds or even buy the most expensive item to finish the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Remember when interacting with the shop, you might accidentially waste all your seeds or money, as buying the new seeds are a lot more expensive then what you gain from selling produce. However when harvesting a plant you gain more produce than you used to plant.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>This was made with godot 3.4 with all custom-made assets, however as both developers on this project are programmers by trade the assets are very much developer art and a tiny bit cursed. Additionally, this genre is something new to the both of us and therefore the development has been a bit slower than anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>Future-work:</p>\n<p>The plan was to have plants wilt, dry out, get bugs etc. and you had to manage them more attentively, however as we ran out of time only the bare minimum has been implemented.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T05:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b0317fa8a23f11eb002731d53463d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlawedVictory"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
