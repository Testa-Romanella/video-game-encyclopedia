Come and enjoy the scenery, have a drink, and partake in some good old fashioned vacation. I think Tom Nook needs a hand with something first, so make sure to lend a hand to the needy raccoon. <br/></p>\n<p>I made this game for the Screamlite game jam. My first game jam, also my first ever game! So I hope you enjoy it ;) Please leave some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. All art assets are made by me. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Antis Instrumentals.</p>\n<p>Scott Arc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0551e3ca21b419927677b22102aceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Horror-RX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
