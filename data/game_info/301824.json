These hammers smash you of walls and the floor over and over....</p>\n<p>Psych! you were the hammers the whole time now let's make that little ball suffer.</p>\n<p>Time to make some art!</p>\n<p>I have been working on this game for almost 4 months. I has a 3D art style that is heavily inspired by the \"Russian Constructionist\" movement.\u00a0 This game is inspired by the joy or game play and game design.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game the players uses \"B\" to move the hammers and \"Space\" to reset the level.</p>\n<p>With 11 unique levels, Swing is a fun engaging experience that allows you to just turn off your brain and have fun again.</p>\n<p>If you like the look of this game and you want to know more about me you can visit my socials\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter-\u00a0https://twitter.com/xocdarb</p>\n<p>Instagram-\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/xocdarb</p>\n<p>Vimeo-\u00a0\u00a0https://vimeo.com/user88229888</p>\n<p>The music I used in my project is\u00a0 shown below all credit and rights to there owners.
