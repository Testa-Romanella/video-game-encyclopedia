You are going to be dropped into the jungles of Rwanda to capture some naughty monkeys that have escaped his workshop. The monkeys were supposed to be turned into little monkey statues, but the monkeys had other plans! Just don't think about the plot too much because I'm making it up as I'm typing out this description.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGOAL\r\n<ul><li>Capture\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0monkeys</li><li>Collect all the presents</li><li>Find all the secret gorillas</li></ul>\n<p>Gamepads don't work unfortunately, mouse and keyboard only.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Left Click to swing net --&gt; hold and use WASD to spin</li><li>Right Click to use Slingshot --&gt; shoot monkeys to temporarily stun them</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>hold right click in the air to use Helicopter toy for gliding</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\r\nNotes\r\n<p>This game was a lot of work for one person, and development did not go smoothly. Because of this the character controller is a bit wonky and you might clip through the ground or something. Try not to break the game too much and good luck climbing the rock face near the waterfall</p>\r\nMusic Credits\r\n<p>Street Party by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4423-street-party</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43bbd45f2d1fbe9c58bcd5ffd04a3600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skleembof"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
