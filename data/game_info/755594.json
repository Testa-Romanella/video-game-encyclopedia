That is because I mistakenly submitted the c3p file, which is the file of Construct 3. I could not work out how to submit it in .exe or upload into itch such that the game can be played in the browser until now. So, I'm going to upload it here in my dashboard as my first game ever. I put in blood and sweat, and nearly tears, into the project. Sleeping 4 hours, skipping breakfast, delaying dinner, not taking\u00a0 a bath for 2 days, sitting for so long until I have back pain (hopefully will go away soon), clicking the mouse until my little finger hurt. I dare say I dedicated everything I have to this project. I can now tell myself that at least I forced myself to learn something new by joining the Game Jam.\u00a0 I'm not sure if I am going to join the next game jam though.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Information\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0this game is only available on laptop browser and not on mobile</li><li>it requires a mouse and a keyboard</li><li>made by construct 3</li><li>All copyright to the Sound Effects remains with GameBurp.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<ul><li>all constructive feedback is welcomed in the comments below</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>be faster on everything and try to use available assets, not draw all from scratch if there is a tight time limit</li><li>research beforehand and prepare a buffer period of time so that I won't submit late/have any issues on submitting</li><li>take care of my health and get enough sleep; try to keep my back straight</li><li>consider continuing to develop games and don't just stop now</li><li>it was fun making this game, and I am certainly proud of what I have made</li><li>the story of making this game might be made into a YouTube video</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Future Updates:</strong></p>\n<p>1 show how many dirt is needed to be mopped</p>\n<p>2 need to show in the instructions that treasure box = bullets or make it an icon above players head</p>\n<p>3 put in time used at the \"you won\" page\u00a0 updated 17.03.2022</p>\n<p>4 put play again button at end screens of game\u00a0updated 17.03.2022</p>\n<p>5 fix bugs or defects like the dot at the \" you won\" page\u00a0\u00a0updated 17.03.2022</p>\n<p>3 make the instruction page less crammed -- insert arrow to click on next subpage in the instructions.\u00a0Also provide images as examples\u00a0</p>\n<p>4 update number of poops(enemy) still alive<br/></p>\n<p>5 add 8 directional movement</p>\n<p>6\u00a0 fix the bug of the replay button</p>\n<p>7\u00a0fix the bug of the game showing the \"you win\" page sometimes before you get all the dirty tiles</p>\n<p>8 Add keyboard combo and collectables for you to speed up, boost, do different movements</p>\n<p><strong>Versions</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>(version 1: 16.03.2022)</li><li><strong>(version 2: 17.03.2022)</strong></li></ol><p>put in time used at the \"you won\" page\u00a0\u00a0updated 17.03.2022</p><p>put play again button at end screens of game\u00a0updated 17.03.2022</p><p>fix bugs or defects like the dot at the \" you won\" page\u00a0\u00a0updated 17.03.2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T07:42:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/9755347497d08e7771ec34dccb3c080f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Holy Birder"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
