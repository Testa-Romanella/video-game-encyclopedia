By playing the tune correctly you earn a new ability that will help you get to other planets. If you complete all 4 songs you can finish the game by visiting the final large planet. There are also optional pick-ups to collect.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left &amp; right arrow keys</strong>: Moves the ship counterclockwise and clockwise around the <em>nearest</em> planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Up and down arrow keys:\u00a0</strong>Increase and decrease gravity effect on ship.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>X key:</strong>\u00a0Jump<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Z key:\u00a0</strong> Toggle music playing mode (only while on the ground).<br/></p>\n<p>In music playing mode the arrow keys become music keys, with each of them representing one tone. If you\u00a0<strong>hold X</strong> while in music mode, the arrow keys will shift up 4 tones to complete the octave. Whenever you press or release the X key the shift will wait for you to change which key you're pressing before shifting.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts about development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It was challenging for me to come up with a good concept that utilized both the music theme and the \"control gravity\"\u00a0limitation. What I arrived at was a combination of a gravity simulation toy, with an Ocarina of Time inspired music player.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm not sure the two parts fit together that well. I would have liked to make them feel more connected. But as it stands the \"music\" part of the game ends up feeling a bit tacked on.</p>\n<p>All in all I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I feel that I managed to get the most out of the concept I tried to make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T07:22:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/5612d27d3e0ef091f3ece6b64aff9283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kerneliron"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
