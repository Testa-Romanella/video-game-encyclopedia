As time progressed into development, the Artificial Intelligence Unit (AIU) responsible for the safety containment protocols in the facility went rogue and deliberately started exterminating all human personnel. Survivors of the mutiny were eventually captured by the AIU\u00a0and infected with the virus as experimental test subjects. Of those captured, you are the only survivor. For some unknown reason, you have become immune to the virus...\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Upon waking from unconsciousness, you realize that\u00a0it is now your responsibility to\u00a0decipher the deactivation code, while also avoiding the AIU,\u00a0to prevent the complete desolation of humanity before time runs out. The fate of humanity is now in your hands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/204bef5e6fa35815e632c510cf5c57c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samlittle24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
