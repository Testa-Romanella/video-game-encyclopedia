{"id": 55627, "slug": "sid-meiers-colonization", "name": "Sid Meier's Colonization", "name_original": "Sid Meier's Colonization", "description": "<p>Sid Meier's Colonization is a computer game by Brian Reynolds and Sid Meier released by MicroProse in 1994. It is a turn-based strategy game themed on the early European colonization of the New World, starting in 1492 and lasting until 1850. It was originally released for DOS, and later ported to Windows 3.1 (1995), the Amiga (1995), and Macintosh (1995). American video game publisher Tommo purchased the rights to this game in 2015 and digitally published it through their Retroism brand.</p>\n<p>Colonization is much like a more developed version of Sid Meier's previous game Civilization (1991) in visual design and handling, but the two have marked differences in gameplay. Instead of forging a nation from nothing, the player manages the cross-Atlantic expansion of an established one in the service of the Crown. As the colonies become more self-sufficient their subservience shifts from boon towards bane, and to win the player must ultimately declare independence and defeat the Royal Expeditionary Force in battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-13T06:56:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18d064a02740c10c839a3546012d922f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 12, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "Linux", "PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MicroProse"], "esrb_rating": null}
