If you load a save, though you can continue the game as normal, certain conversations and bonuses will be locked due to save data loss. I would <strong>HIGHLY </strong>recommend completing your first playthrough in one sitting.<br/><br/>Certain interactions in the game are missing in the Web build due to technical limitations. These range from minor and unnoticeable for most players to impacting the <strong><em>true ending</em></strong> of the game. If you don't know what these interactions are then I'd advise downloading the game.\n\r\nThe passkey is 665.
