Everything is already dead or dying... except you. Or so you think. Don't Escape: 4 Days in a Wasteland is a post-apocalyptic indie adventure from the creator of the wildly popular Flash series. Different obstacles have a chance to be shown in every chapter, allowing for extra replay value, and your choices and actions determine whether you survive to see the next stage of the game.<br/><br/>After scraping out a bleak existence in the wastelands, you thought you were prepared for anything. But one night a terrifying nightmare makes you bolt up from sleep. And when you realise it might not be just a bad dream, you also realise there\u2019s no way to run. The choices you make determine how everything plays out. In each chapter, you\u2019ll need to choose what to do to manage your time most effectively before sundown. Repair a bridge? Look for supplies? Travel to a distant location? Each will cost you some time, and when that runs out, it\u2019s time to face the music and see if you planned appropriately, or if there\u2019s going to be another body in the wasteland.<br/><br/><ul><li>Time mechanics; some actions will advance the clock!<br/></li><li>Old school point-and-click gameplay with logical puzzles.<br/></li><li>Choices and decisions that actively impact the outcome.<br/></li><li>Variable problems for each chapter to enhance replay.<br/></li><li>An engaging story with a creepy, desolate atmosphere.<br/></li><li>Classic pixel-art presentation of a post-apocalyptic tale.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T03:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcc/dcccef2e17f3b2f1eec0a19cb9b98a94.jpg", "website": "http://dont-escape.com/", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 522, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["scriptwelder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Armor Games Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
