I thought I would be learning that way, but when it comes to making my own prototypes, I am usually stuck because i am so reliant on finding the \"perfect\" line of code or else my game wouldn't function as efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways to solve a problem, and sometimes I shouldn't underestimate whether or not my lines of code are \"perfect\" or not. There is not perfect way of doing things, only more efficient ways of doing things.</p>\n\n<p>This is how I managed to finally complete a game and be proud of it, even if it's shit. I gave myself the challenge to make a game's mechanics, and only worried about if it does the job. This is because later down the road I would be able to clean it up again, and see how I could do it better.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this is the start of more to come. I am really excited about this project, I hope I don't give up on it, like I usually do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T06:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/44215324117c2257753357bbfe9b69fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sireoh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
