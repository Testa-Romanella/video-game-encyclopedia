The point of this experiment was to try to make a type of lighting that matched the theme of the game I'm working on at the moment. Since this is just the test scene and it doesn't actually have any assets in it, I'm showing it as an example of what is possible in unity.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>The reflections don't display perfectly on WebGL but the screenshots display how it should look like if you attempt doing this tutorial;</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>To make a similar look in Unity you will need to do: </strong><br/>\n<em>Assets &gt; Import Package &gt; Effects</em>\n</p><p>\n<strong>ON AN EMPTY GAME OBJECT:<br/>\n</strong>Add a Reflection Probe (unity asset)\r\n</p><p>\n<em>This is the effect that makes reflections on any material</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>bellow is the settings I used in my project:</em>\n</p><p>\n</p><p><strong><em>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:</em></strong></p><p>Reflection probes are highly demanding on computers so you should use a script to detect when to render it. You can use your own or use the one I included bellow (C#). </p><p>What it does is that it dynamically updates the rendering if the player moves. You can also control how many times it executes rendering when a movement is detected and how many times per frame it activates. The instruction on how to use it is written inside it.</p><p>The script is free to use even in commercial settings as long as you give credits. (Veronique J.
