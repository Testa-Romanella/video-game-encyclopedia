Most of it is best fetched\u00a0unmodified from the sources listed below. But the character sprites in a Traviso-friendly format are not. So feel free to use your browser's network tab to download all the PNGs and their related JSON files for use in your own projects per the terms of the Liberated Pixel Cup. Even though it is not required by changing the path from \"traviso/traviso.dev.js\" to \"traviso/traviso.js\" or \"traviso/traviso.d.ts\" you can obtain the Traviso version I used (feel free to use these files\u00a0yourself under the same terms as Traviso). Some parts of the project have restrictions on commercial use (the music) or other restrictions (the Desyrel font).\u00a0The game\u00a0is not open source at this time. \ud83d\ude41<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Gothic Archways by\u00a0Lukas K\u00fcstenmacher,\u00a0Desyrel by\u00a0Apostrophic Labs, LPC generator by\u00a0sanderfrenken,\u00a0Traviso by\u00a0Hakan Karlidag, free music by\u00a0Chad Crouch,\u00a0\u00a0React Simon Says by\u00a0Weslley Araujo and\u00a0free sounds from\u00a0Benjaminnelan and ashjenx</p>\n<p><strong>Liberate Pixel Cup Artists</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Charles Sanchez (CharlesGabriel),\u00a0 Daniel Eddeland (daneeklu),\u00a0 DarkwallLKE,\u00a0 David Conway Jr. (JaidynReiman),\u00a0 ElizaWy,\u00a0 Evert,\u00a0 Johannes Sj\u00f6lund (wulax),\u00a0 Lanea Zimmerman (Sharm),\u00a0 Manuel Riecke (MrBeast),\u00a0 Matthew Krohn (makrohn),\u00a0 Michael Whitlock (bigbeargames),\u00a0 Nila122,\u00a0 Stephen Challener (Redshrike),\u00a0 Thane Brimhall (pennomi),\u00a0 Tracy,\u00a0 Tuomo Untinen (reemax),\u00a0 bluecarrot16,\u00a0 gr3yh47,\u00a0 laetissima, Stephen Challener (Redshrike),\u00a0Mandi Paugh,\u00a0William.Thompsonj,\u00a0Benjamin K.
