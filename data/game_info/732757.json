I've thus went  for the \"backdrop hack\" and tried to match the simple aesthetic of Bitsy  games with a aesthetic twist.\r\n  </p>\n<p>It was fun, although a little bit frustrating! I hope you'll like it.  There's only one looping ending but various stories inside.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Story, graphics and music by me<br/></em></p><p><em>Hacks used: backdrops, directional avatar, long dialog, multi-sprite avatar, permanent items, transparent sprites</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T03:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649180871f5fab579ed56e703ebb481a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jsmonzani"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
