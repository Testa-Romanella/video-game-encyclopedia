You'll be tested on your skill : use your mouse to cut down unnecessary leaves, and try to get the requested number of flowers. This game is quite hard, you should expect to restart some levels a couple of times.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a gif of the first level :</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t display the current level number, so as a reference you can find a screenshot of all levels in this imgur album : https://imgur.com/a/CbY2udw. Please don\u2019t look at it if you haven\u2019t already tried the game to avoid spoiler.</p>\n\n<p>Tools used : Unity, Audacity, Bxfr, Bosca Ceoil, PyxelEdit, Aseprite.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I've never done any Mac or Linux build before and couldn't test them so please tell me if it doesn't work, I'll fix it as soon as possible !</p>\n\n<p>Some known (minor) bugs :</p>\n<ul><li>for some reason the web version displays a line in level 1. It\u2019s an object I\u2019ve deleted from the hierarchy a long time ago. I have no idea why it\u2019s still popping here.</li><li>when restarting a level, sometimes your life will have an initial small decrease. It\u2019s not much of an annoyance though, and it might disappear if you try the level once again.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Vovoda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
