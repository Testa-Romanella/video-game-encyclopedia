{"id": 54227, "slug": "the-ultimate-stuntman", "name": "The Ultimate Stuntman", "name_original": "The Ultimate Stuntman", "description": "<p>The Ultimate Stuntman is a 1990 video game developed by Codemasters and published by Camerica for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring action game elements. The Ultimate Stuntman is one of 14 video games published by Camerica for the NES without proper licensing. The company had to create their own cartridges that would bypass Nintendo&#39;s lock-out chip and break the 10NES &quot;code&quot;. In virtually all of Camerica&#39;s games (including The Ultimate Stuntman) there is a switch found on the reverse side of the cartridge, this allows the user to switch between NTSC and PAL compatibility.<br />\nAnother unusual aspect of Camerica games released for the NES is their distinctive color cartridges. The Ultimate Stuntman, like all Codemasters games, was released as a gold cartridge in the U.S. and a black cartridge in Europe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-04T07:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1fa/1fa88eeac7db4510c06cefcf96af03a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Camerica"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
