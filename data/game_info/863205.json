Every ten seconds the bomb strapped to your chest will explode unless you reach the point quota in time!</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- You do tricks by hitting the arrow keys or WASD at the same time (or quickly back to back). For example to do a floop trick hit down and right! This trick will get you points and launch you into the air, where you can follow it up with another trick.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Doing tricks consecutively will build up a combo and get you bonus points the higher the combo. A combo ends when you touch the ground after being in air, or if you fumble.\r\n</p>\n<p>- You will fumble if you hit a key combination that doesn't match a trick.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Doing different types of tricks in one combo will get you bonus style points. Doing as many different tricks as you can before a combo ends can net you a lot of bonus points!</p><p><strong>Move list:</strong></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca3d1d001fe0bb0d37e25acf1a89c53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jared Devs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
