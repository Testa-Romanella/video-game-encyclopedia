There are no survivors... at least no human ones.</p>\n<p>You are an Omega Series AXIOM warehouse robot\u00a0-a top of the line shelf stacker bot- and you've just awoken amid the carnage. You were never meant for combat. But it seems the guys at SPHYNX have been illegally\u00a0tampering with your code in an attempt of turning you into a soldier. Doesn't\u00a0look like\u00a0they really succeeded at it, but at least you can somewhat defend yourself now.</p>\n<p>The only thing you know is that you must\u00a0escape from Mandrillia.</p>\n\n<p>In an asymmetrical local multiplayer VR vs PC game, players use the same computer to play as totally different characters. In this case, for the VR player this is a survival/stealth shooter, while for the PC players it's a third person game of cat and mouse.</p>\n\n\n<p>While there are no plans to add <em>real</em> online to the game, it can be played with people across the world via the use of software like Parsec, which do a remote emulation of local play (just like Steam's own \"Remote Local Play Together\"). The way these work is by having the VR player act as a host with the game being streamed to the clients.</p>\n<p>One advantage of this system is that only the VR player needs to have the game on their computer;\u00a0the Mandrillian players just have to connect to the host via Parsec.</p>\n\n<p>Despite SPHYNX efforts, you are still not a soldier robot. However, your sturdy frame and ability to use\u00a0tools -and weapons-\u00a0can prove useful to survive the Mandrillians. Go the sneaky way or guns blazing -anything goes as long as you escape.</p>\n\n<p>When you play as the VR player, your objective is to get out of SPHYNX facilities. Find high clearance keycards to unlock areas\u00a0where you can reload your arsenal and repair your body, and eventually open the gates to freedom.</p>\n<p>Doing that won't be easy with your friends trying to hunt you, though. You'll need to use every tool at your disposal, like your trusty Multitool and an assortment of weapons and devices you'll find scattered across the environment.</p>\n<p>Your best friend will be your Multitool and its three functions:\u00a0a radar to check if there are Mandrillians nearby, a cloaking device to hide from them, and a short-range stun function if things get hairy. But mind those battery levels!</p>\n\n<p>Besides the Multitool, there's an arsenal of weapons to be looted from the corpses and storage crates scattered around the facility. Conventional weaponry like handguns, shotguns and machine guns, hi-tech stuff like plasma revolvers, heavy ordinance like rocket and grenade launchers, C4 charges and mines... Just be sure you manage your ammunition and inventory storage properly so you don't go dry at the worst moment!</p>\n<p>The environment can also work for or against you;\u00a0explosive barrels with different effects and keycard-locked doors could help you get out of tight situations.</p>\n\n<p>They have been\u00a0used as test subjects for too long. Peace is no longer an option for these primates.</p>\n\n<p>Powerful, fast, and smarter than they look, when you take control of them you'll have an assortment of skills to help you track and destroy the Robot:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Your superior sense of smell will come in handy when the VR player is trying to cloak or hide around the map.<br/></p>\n<p>Your enhanced hearing can be used to track the player via the pings in the minimap if it makes any noise;\u00a0things like running will need you to be close to him for it to appear, while louder things like opening gates or firing weapons will appear on the minimap no matter where you are.</p>\n<p>The vent system is your friend when you want to move quickly around the map;\u00a0it also has powerups for the monkeys to heal and 1-ups, and all the vents you break will be able to be used as respawn points.</p>\n<p>Your attacks are not only useful to kill the Robot:\u00a0they can also be used to break open locked gates</p>\n<p>Just rushing the Robot can be dangerous, especially if it has good weapons and plenty of ammo;\u00a0be smart and sneak around to catch it off-guard... or just make it get nervous enough it starts making mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Escape from Mandrillia has a learning curve that can make experienced players annihilate newcomers. Because that is no fun for anyone, you'll be able to tweak dozens of modifiers to tip the balance towards the VR or PC side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To do that, simply play around with the consoles on the menu scene. Don't try to be cheeky -the Mandrillian players will see any change you make to the rules from their cages!</p>\n<p>Some of the settings are basic stuff like amount of Mandrillian extra lifes, respawn times, player speed/health,\u00a0starting gear, etc. However, others will drastically change the feel and pacing of the game, like Dynamic Respawn (monkeys can freely respawn wherever they please), Akimbo Mode (you don't have the multitool, getting instead a second sidearm), Infinite Sidearm/Longarm ammo... You can even customize things like the type of loot you will find around the level.</p>\n<p><em>\"Dynamic Spawn\"\u00a0modifier allows Mandrillians to spawn wherever they please</em></p>\n<p><em>VR player skins like \"Stealth\" make sneaking way easier</em></p>\n<p>On top of that, you can use pre-made \"presets\" that will automatically change all the settings to offer a pre-tested experience. The simpler ones like \"Mandrillian Bias\" or \"Robot Bias\" are purely meant to make the game easier for less skilled PC or VR players respectively, but others like \"Horror\" or \"Super\u00a0Soldier\" change the game into a full-on survival experience or an action-packed shooter.</p>\n<p><em>v i o l e n c i a</em><br/></p>\n<p>Also planned are \"custom presets\" where players will save their preferred settings to quickly select in future sessions.<br/></p>\n\n<p>After two and a half years working on this game, I\u00a0felt it was presentable enough for the Alpha\u00a0Itch release.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this point, I want to know what people think about the game and see if it's sensible to keep working on it to the point I have planned to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any case, there are things I\u00a0will add to the game whatever the reception is.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>THINGS TO BE ADDED FOR SURE</strong></p>\n<p>Those are features currently being worked on that will be made available here no matter what happens:</p>\n<ul><li>Finish up and polish the current map section<ul><li>Change Warehouse, Research and Waste Disposal entrance placeholders to the\u00a0 proper final entrances (but still have those areas closed)</li><li>Change the Exit placeholder to the final \"elevator\" scene</li></ul><ul><li>Final layout for all the corpses</li></ul><ul><li>Implementation of the CEO Office \"mini quest\"<br/>\n</li></ul></li><li>Add several new weapons</li><li>Add remaining core gameplay systems<ul><li>Mandrillian vent powerups (special consumable items that will spawn along the current 1-ups and healing items in the vents)</li></ul><ul><li>Security cameras (use keycards on the security room to activate cameras around the map that will notify you of any Mandrillian movement in your multitool)</li><li>Extra VR player melee options for Super\u00a0Soldier mode</li></ul></li><li>Add single player \"activities\" accessible from the menu:<ul><li>Tutorial scene</li></ul><ul><li>Endless \"practice\" scenes</li></ul></li><li>Replace current background music placeholder I\u00a0crappily made\u00a0with proper music</li></ul>\n<p><strong>POSSIBLE STEAM RELEASE / ITCH FINAL RELEASE</strong></p>\n<p>If things go well enough, I would like to get the game on Steam and hopefully gain more visibility. If not, these features could end up being an Itch \"final release\":</p>\n<ul><li>Map additions<ul><li>Full Warehouse section</li><li>Full Research &amp; Development section</li><li>Full Waste Disposal section</li></ul></li><li>Gameplay additions<ul><li>Even more weapons</li></ul><ul><li>Second Mandrillian character, (Mecha-Mandrillian)</li></ul><ul><li>Mandrillian bots to either play single-player or make matches with friends more challenging<br/>\n</li></ul><ul><li>VRxPC coop mode to fight against said bots</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>THE DREAM RELEASE</strong></p>\n<p>These are features that would be added if the game did well enough to keep working on it for quite a long time. Could be almost considered \"expansions\" to the base game:</p>\n<ul><li>Add the final sections after the current \"exit\"<ul><li>The Assembly Line</li><li>The Core</li><li>The Surface</li></ul></li><li>Add the rest of Mandrillian characters, for a total of 6</li></ul>\n\n<p>I am Germ\u00e1n, a Spanish 3D artist. After learning to make VR apps for archviz gigs, I\u00a0decided to try my hand in game developing, and I regret it every single day.</p>\n<p>I discovered the world of asymmetric VR games thanks to Panoptic and Mass Exodus, both of which I\u00a0love. I noticed these kind of games tended to put the PC players in the \"underdog\" role, and wondered if anyone had used the potential of the format for horror.</p>\n<p>And that's how I\u00a0found Space Security Guard Simulator, which is the main inspiration for Escape from Mandrillia. After having tons of fun with it and friends, I\u00a0decided I wanted to try my hand at an asymmetric horror game. Heavily influenced by movies like <em>Aliens </em>or<em> Predator</em>, the idea was to have a game where the gameplay itself made the players -both VR and\u00a0PC- act like in a horror movie.</p>\n<p>All in all, my three goals were to learn, to get a game my friends and I could have fun with, and maybe make some money. The first two goals have been met so far.</p>\n<p>If you have fun with the game and for some reason feel like burning more money to support my crippling addictions, consider tossing a coin at my ko-fi, it will be greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f7ecf77108a501cbf89e1fb13b528b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["germanban"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
