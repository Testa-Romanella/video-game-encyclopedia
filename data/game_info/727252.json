The game itself is a stationary shooter where you use the gyroscope controls on your phone to look around. Enemies will continuously spawn up to a limit and will attack the player with three different attacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Green Grenades: This is the most common form of attack and to avoid taking damage you need to shoot the grenade by using the shoot button.</p>\n<p>Blue Grenades: The second most common form of attack is the blue grenade which after three seconds will detonate in front of the player. To avoid taking damage the player must be shouting as the explosion goes off.</p>\n<p>Red Grenades: The most rare form of attack. When a red grenade appears in front of the player they will get a prompt to \"Shove\". To shove the grenade back the player needs to swipe upwards. This shoves the grenade back at the enemy that threw it and is the only way to actually kill an enemy.</p>\n<p>The only goal in the game is to accumulate as much score as possible which you will do by surviving for as long as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T09:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a90e8f1bf855c67e0df4a7e0f1b9831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["nytemart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
