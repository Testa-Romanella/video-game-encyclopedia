It's your grandfather..He came to wish you a happy birthday. It's kind of strange because he usually just calls and that's the end of it.\u00a0\"Thanks..\" you say.\u00a0 \"No problem\" he takes something out of his pocket. \"I think it's time I gave you this, I've gotten my fair share out of it.\" He gives you a crumpled $2 bill. \"You don't see these much anymore, they are a bit rare, especially this one.\" he says. Without another word he turns around and yells over his shoulder, \"you're 18 now, why don't you go down to the arena and bet on a couple matches.\" He chuckles\u00a0and slowly\u00a0gets in his car</p><p>(Created during United Game Jam's - 48 hr competition).<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>2.

I thought of the idea 2 hours after the theme was announced and worked on it 10 hours Friday and 11.5 hours Saturday. There was absolutely zero prep done before the jam.\u00a0I am 2-3 months into programming and this was hands down one of the best learning experiences i've had. There were so many small problems I needed to figure out. Like singletons, who knew about those things.. they're great. I feel so dang proud of myself for attempting and COMPLETING this.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, thank you UGJ.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Highscores:</p>\n<p>Myself: $64 (I spent all this time programming, dont judge)</p>\n<p>Girlfriend: $6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88f92f61f0e2eacde1531177e5961700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bronze_Dagger"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
