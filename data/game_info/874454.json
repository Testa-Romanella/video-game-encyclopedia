One day, that tower had mysteriously disappeared - taking every home with it. Villagers often attributed this vanishing to <strong>The Cult</strong>, a group of wizards who wanted to control the world by summoning dark, unknown powers. Of course, this didn\u2019t end up quite as they had planned. <br/><br/>Many years later, <strong>Lonesome Villag</strong>e was founded on the same ground, and people flocked from all over the world to live there. Everything was well for a while, until the people of Lonesome soon discovered that the village wanted to remain alone. But of course, that\u2019s where you come in. <br/><br/><strong>There\u2019s so much to be done, let\u2019s just hope The Cult doesn\u2019t come back to stir up any trouble while you\u2019re working\u2026</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-14T01:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/242/242f503b2216fb166485f8aa8bf7367d.jpg", "website": "http://lonesomevillage.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ogre Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ogre Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
