It's an explosive new take on familiar games we know and love. It places you in a fast-paced multiplayer arena\u00a0that will put your focus, speed, and dexterity to the test.\u00a0Players shoot the ball to hit the opponent's goal. With every impact, the goal shrinks. Each goal has a maximum number of hits before it completely diminishes and the game is over.</p>\n<p><em>A note from the dev: Hecticube once upon a time was available on both Google Play and on the Apple App Store, but due to the stores mandating updates, the game is no longer available through those stores. Sorry for the inconvenience!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T10:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f2f417322a24bfee0b9100d1624346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GrahamOfLegend"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
