Only the strong will survive the onslaught of demon logs!!!<br/></p>\n<p>Press the trigger to equip a kunai and one of the thumb buttons to equip a paper bomb. Drop the bomb on a kunai to arm it! There is snap turning as well if you move the thumbstick. Oh and there's hand physics, so slap whatever you want!<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 7 days for the VR Jam 2020. The theme was One Tool, Many Uses. I loved \u00a0the theme! And what better tools than ninja tools?? But I only got the throwing and paper bombs working before the deadline. My next mechanic was to attach a mini parachute to the kunai so you could set up floating traps around you!<br/></p>\n<p>Ultra credits and kudos to Nathan Tullis for help with production, art, and design. And the amazing score was produced by Alexandre Jannuzzi. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>-Wyattari<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea80ea15e5ef2f69bea4b984713c83d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wyattari"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
