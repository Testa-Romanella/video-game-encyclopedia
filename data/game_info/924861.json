Their powerful overlords commanded their pawns to protect them at all costs of saving themselves. This is the Battle of Exampleton.</em></p>\n<p>The Knights begin their attack, one of the\u00a0 pawns contemplates their decision for movement. They have several options, but chooses to flank from the left side.</p>\n\n<p>They also contemplate yelling to their opponent for a switch in the enemy positioning, but decides that their inevitable, next mode of attack is good for their friendly Knights.</p>\n\n<p>The Vikings are next on the chopping block, so they jump headfirst into battle.</p>\n\n<p>The Vikings recognize their positioning is at a fault. So the overlord uses their might to put the\u00a0Knights in a disadvantageous position.</p>\n\n<p>But to their demise, the Knights already had a card up their sleeve...</p>\n\n<p>And that was the Battle of Exampleton. But while the Knights won the battle, they didn't win the war.\u00a0\u2694\ufe0f</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming by Robert \"Tye\" Riley and Dylan Webb\r\n</p>\n<p>Art by Jackson Webb and Will Britting\r\n</p>\n<p>Music, Sound Effects and Integration\u00a0by TaiTheThai\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional Programming by Matthew Fosse\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional love by everybody\u00a0\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:11:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/747aa1eaa6815b53d33044e96f9e8fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JacksonWebb", "dylanwebb", "taithethai", "Tye"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
