It was made over the course of two months and runs on a retail Nintendo 64. The theme for the game jam was <strong>\"</strong><strong>control\"</strong>. My natural answer to that was first-person voodoo chess.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play the game with a Nintendo 64 flashcart. Most emulators should work too, such as Ares or mupen64plus.<br/></p>\n<p>The premise of the game involves Zatt, a young warrior-in-training. Zatt aims to scale the Demon's Spire and become a Wizard of the Board. Or, at least he thinks he does.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fba96c9e2317866ad27fb7146b8554ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Savage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
