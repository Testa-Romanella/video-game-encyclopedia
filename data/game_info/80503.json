These squares are - blocked. The loop does not go there.<br/>---Some squares contain clues that restrict the way you can go: <br/>+Yellow = go this way. <br/>+Red = go straight. <br/>+Blue = must turn. <br/> <br/>TIPS<br/>---You don't have to draw the whole loop at once. Draw pieces of the loop, places where you know it must go, and then connect the pieces.<br/>---Take a wrong turn? No problem. Draw backwards or use the undo button or the eraser. <br/>---All puzzles can be solved logically, but you can always resort to intuition if you get stuck! <br/><br/>ENJOY the 27 puzzles in LOOPical Lite.
