It is already evening and you look forward to your after-work hours. Hoping your work day will soon end, you are currently in your office caring about your plant. But of course, your stupid colleagues call you all the time, so can resolve their trivial problems. The only way to survive the evening is coffee. A lot of coffee.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Your goal is to hold out as long as possible. Therefore, it is necessary to fulfil the tasks of your colleagues. This will keep your reputation high. If you fail too often, your colleagues are going to complain about you and eventually you will get fired. You also have to keep your caffeine in check. To stay awake, you have to drink coffee, but beware too much isn\u2019t healthy as well.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WSAD - move\r\n<br/>F - interact with your environment\r\n<br/>SPACE - dash\r\n<br/>1 - accept task\r\n<br/>2 - decline task\r\n<br/>ESC - quit to main menu\r\n<br/>If you want to mute the music, press M in-game.\r\n<br/>If you want to mute the sounds, press N in-game.  </p>\r\nTechnical Details\r\n<p>The game was made in Java with the libGDX Framework ( https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ ).
