You've always wanted a store and so you start one, taking out a decent business loan for the endeavor. But the only kind of job that will gratify you is one where you are the boss...and the cashier. And the janitor. And the guy who opens the boxes. Or assembles the furniture. Or catalogs inventory. You display items on shelves, unload trucks, deal with customers, and get to keep aaaalll the money.<br/><br/>Start out with a small store and sell your way up. As you earn money, you can use them on upgrades like better advertising to get more customers in or faster deliveries to stock up faster. Just one possible consequence during your career is poor management; it's just a fact of single-employee-boss-janitor establishments that try to make it big time. But that's not you, is it?<br/><br/>As they say: if you want something done right, do it yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2d740cf70b6a1c50883b5a0766b0ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["slimer37"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
