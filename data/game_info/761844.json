Can you find the cure while chugging potions and racing against time trying to sustain your human form? Make your way to the Temple of Arnoxk where you hope to find a cure and your salvation.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Left and Right will move you. Down will allow you to go through wood platforms. Z will jump. A controller will work, but all in-game prompts refer to the keyboard. As a slime you will lose your sense of time and be unable to use checkpoints.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa018b15158b4fd568b385b67cc75da1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["morokiane"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
