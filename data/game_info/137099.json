Hydra Space Attack is a fasted pace action clicker where if you kill one ship two more will take its place.   </p>\n<p>Art and Design by Tim McMillen\r\n  </p>\n<p>Code by Kim Tran\r\n  </p>\n<p>We have both been huge fans of extra credits for years. We were crushed that the set the first ever game jam up on the weekend that we loaded everything else up on to make ready for a different game jam on the following weekend. Yet want to still take part we decided to try something crazy. We are the both Teacher assistants for an Intro to Game Programming. Since the Friday of the game jam was on the first day of class and that is just the day we talk about the syllabus we choose to do a one-hour game jam in the back of the class just the two of us. We also choose to break from our normal roles Tim being a Producer and Kim being an Artist. With that being said we are submitting the build as it was (minus fixing a single error that stopped us form compiling) at the end of that class.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc01de78de77f685e98d930ca6656a01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baneofwar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
