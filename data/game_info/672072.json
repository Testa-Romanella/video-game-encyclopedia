It's just 1 single scene with a 3D alien  character that you can interact with using a menu like Fallout 3. The  menu shows a number of options that you can select to respond. You can  select with a beam from your hand control OR you can just say the  selection and the built in speech recognition will figure out what  option you're chosen.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a test to see if I could make a character that felt a little more real in VR. <br/></p><p>Oculus does not include the speech recognition libraries in their OS so this project uses a light weight, embedded speech recognizer.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nThe speech recognition is on-board the device so there will be a bit of lag on the Quest 1 as opposed to the Quest 2. \r\nRight now, you can only interact with one character but it would be easy to add more interaction. <br/></p><p>O<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T08:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4eafa2639f1bf2a892a536e79adb72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loud Shirt Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
