Avoid spikes and grab the power-up for some assistance, but beware as you could accidentaly get an ability which isn't as ideal from it. It took me 3 days to make and is my first game so enjoy!\u00a0Use A and D to move left and right, and use space to jump. Esc opens the pause screen. Try and get the highest score you can! Good luck.</p>\n<p>Assets from the \"Free 2D Mega Pack\u00a0by Brackleys on the Unity asset store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T16:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/dae82a0e152188004c2275d28952d2a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NeoHz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
