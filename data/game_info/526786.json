This is already our last shot.\r\n<p>Take command of Earth's first and last interstellar starship, the Sojourner, and flee our dying world with the last remnants of the human race. In The Last Voyage you must manage the Sojourner's resources while seeking out new worlds for humanity begin again on.\u00a0The Sojourner's journey through the stars is relativistic. Once you leave a fledgling colony behind,\u00a0 you will find decades have passed by the time you return to the system.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the arrow keys to pilot the Sojourner. Left and right arrows will rotate the ship. Hold up to fire the main thrusters. Hold down for reverse thrust.</p>\n<p>Hover over items in the display to reveal details and click on planets or ship systems to access the Sojourner's functions.</p>\n<p>You can press P to pause the game.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Once the Sojourner launches, you will see a view of nearby space, and indicator of the Sojourner\u2019s location and a trajectory projection. Ship status and systems are available on the right hand side of the display. Navigate to the edge of a system to start an interstellar voyage.</p>\n<p>Ancient deep-space telescopes have already determined that the available destinations have possibly habitable worlds, but only an in-system analysis by the Sojourner\u2019s scanners can determine a world\u2019s habitability. Scanners can also pick up anomalies and signs of existing life.</p>\n<p>The Sojourner has massive stocks of supplies and automated factories to support its mission. Use the fabricator system to construct landing craft and orbitals to establish new human civilizations. Constructing orbitals requires repurposing ship components the Sojourner\u2019s automated factories are incapable of producing, and will permanently reduce the ship\u2019s integrity. Simple landing craft have no such limitations.\u00a0The fabricator\u00a0system can also repair and resupply the ship.</p>\n<p>While the Sojourner is a massive vessel, it is quite fragile. If it is subjected to acceleration beyond 2g it will suffer damage. Nor does it have the maneuverability to avoid collisions when operating at high speeds in an asteroid field.</p>\n<p>The Sojourner is rated for ~50 years (relative) endurance without repairs or resupply. It is equipped with mining drones to scavenge supplies from asteroid fields, and solar arrays to recharge its fuel cells while in close solar orbit. Not all damage can be repaired though\u2026</p>\n<p>If the ship\u2019s integrity or fuel reaches 0%, the Sojourner will no longer be operable and it\u2019s voyage\u00a0will end.<br/></p><p>The Last Voyage is copyright 2020 Justin Reardon.</p>\n<p>The Last Voyage is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>The Last Voyage is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
