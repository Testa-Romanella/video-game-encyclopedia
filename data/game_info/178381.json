Clamber out of the depths towards the surface, catching as many flies as you can in the process!</p><p>Gamepad is highly recommended: flick the left analogue stick to jump, &amp; the Y button generates a new level in case you get stuck. Alternatively, jump with numpad keys 1-9, and regenerate the level with Enter.</p><p>Created in GameMaker by Rob Haines (@rob_haines).
