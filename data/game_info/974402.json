{"id": 974402, "slug": "snake-effect", "name": "Snake Effect", "name_original": "Snake Effect", "description": "<strong>This is a very cool role-playing Snake game. Our design focuses on the combat experience of each character, spending a lot of time adjusting scene effects, skill effects, sound effects, and game difficulty. Now each greedy snake has 8 different skills. Their skills will have certain characteristics, and each character will bring you a different experience. We are committed to the transformation of the casual attributes of the game, the simplest interaction and the simplest character development system (as the time of using the character increases, the character will become stronger and stronger). Unlocking characters mainly depends on clearing the game and defeating enemies. The game provides unlimited levels, and the difficulty of all levels will gradually increase. In the constant game challenges, you will obtain Stean achievements and challenge rankings. The game provides local single-player mode and two-player mode. You are welcome to play with your friends.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T05:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6b/b6ba8c1d3c0630f3edbbc7beb7523f82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oooyqx"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["oooyqx"], "esrb_rating": null}
