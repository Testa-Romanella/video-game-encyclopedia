Author unknown ***<br/><br/>\u2026the sun scorched our world and left behind ruins of sand, consumed by war and time. And thus we journeyed into the void, aimlessly wandering for peace and a second chance at life.<br/><br/>The galaxy eventually forgave our sins, sheltered us beneath the warmth of a thousand other suns, and fed us its planetary wonders. But it never once forgot our true nature.<br/><br/>Years of hardships brought widespread discontent among the now scattered human colonies. The sky had given us hope for a new home\u2026but soon hope turned into greed, greed into hate, and hate into war. The Faction Wars, we called them. <br/><br/>Violent in-fighting pushed us to the galaxy\u2019s limits, and to ours. They were waiting for us there. We paid no heed to them, the foolish man looking at his finger pointing at the moon. They paid no heed to us, the mighty gods uninterested in the bickering of ants.<br/><br/>Left to our own devices, we reunited once again under two unwavering banners: us, the Terrans and\u2026us once again, the Alterians. Only humans, divided by an invisible, impossible mountain. Terrans, all so resourceful, raised from sweat and grease yet always gazing at the line beyond the horizon. Alterians\u2026elegant, advanced, beautiful\u2026yet so eerily obsessed with the dream of otherworldly perfection.<br/><br/>The last two Houses of Man grew distant, as resentful brothers in a perennial fight over which family path to thread on. Never-ending expansion and gorging of resources, or rejection of human blemishes in pursuit of unachievable divinity? We chose the first and as first we stroke. We ransacked and pillaged whole worlds, and not once did we feel the burden of guilt. And now, Alterians\u2019 inhuman wrath unfolds before my eyes. As honorable and just as they sure are, never had their reaction been so vicious. <br/><br/>I wonder as I gaze into the sky, knowing that this planet will soon be no more. No matter from which side you\u2019ll unfold the events to come, I beg you: unite mankind again, annihilate those who stand in the way, and free us from our ancestral shackles. But most of all, I beg you forgiveness for the man I once was.<br/><br/>May the horizon never look so broken again.<br/><br/>*** End of transmission ***", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce296c8a6ad11fc9edc356831638d868.jpeg", "website": "http://planetstormgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aykiro"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Aykiro"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
