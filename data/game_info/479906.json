Total Fail, spent the entire time on game mechanics and the last day on progression design and some polish. Had to switch from endless with points to a simple 3 planes per level. had to scrap making menu and high score board. Also ran of time before working on the slide. and the repair system. oh well<br/></p>\n<p>future Level progression ideas:panels will break and need repairing by fast clicking, and word swaping like 3 means 2 up is down and so on.\u00a0 an endless version with points and high score would of been better.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Music By: bensound.com</p>\n<p>Some ui: kenney.nl<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a4/6a4afc0373c2b44491ab6f42285d20c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Markedagain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
