You can play offline by yourself, or online with your friends. All rooms are private\u00a0(requiring a room code) for now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As with most word games, there is a chance you will see words or definitions that are offensive to you. We've taken steps to minimize the likelihood of this, but it's still possible.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>Get the most points. Do this by:</p>\n<ul><li>Creating multiple words per turn</li><li>Using your own colored cards to build those words</li><li>Spreading your control (color) to other cards</li><li>Avoiding giving your teammates extra points</li></ul>\r\nOn your FIRST turn\r\n<p>Take 1 card from your HAND and place it at any EMPTY location on the GRID.\r\n</p>\n<p>No cards change control, even if they form a word. (They do not change color.)\r\n</p>\n<p>No points are awarded.\r\n</p>\r\nOn SUBSEQUENT turns\r\n<p>You have two options. Either:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Option A (not recommended):</strong> Play 1 card from your HAND and to the DISCARD pile.\r\n</p>\n<p>No cards change control.\r\n</p>\n<p>No points are awarded.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Play 1 card from your HAND (recommended) OR the DISCARD pile (not recommended), to the GRID.</strong> Place the card anywhere that builds AT LEAST 1 word. You can place the card on top of an existing card or a blank space.\r\n</p>\n<p>For each built word:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Control</strong>: If your card is the START of the word (i.e., it forms a word with the neighbor to the RIGHT or BELOW), then it gains control of the neighboring card. The neighboring card's color will change to match the card you played.\r\n<ol><li>This occurs BEFORE scoring.</li><li>If the neighboring card is the start of any word, then you gain control of its neighbor, and control recursively\u00a0\u00a0 flows out from that card, and so on.<br/>\n</li></ol></li><li><strong>Scoring</strong>:<ol><li>You receive 1 point, whether or not you control the card you played. (It's rare, but if you play a card that someone else discarded, you won't have \"control\" that card.)\r\n</li><li>The player who controls the neighboring card receives 1 point. Sometimes that player is you - so you have an incentive to build words that are fully in your control.</li></ol></li></ol>\n<p>Either way, you will automatically draw a card from the DECK, if any cards remain.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Example word building</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Here's a dramatic example of how words are built, and how they\u00a0\u00a0change color.\r\n</p>\n<p>Suppose the blue player plays a blue \"<strong>LE</strong>\" card in the middle of these other 4 cards:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\n\"SS\" and \"ND\" start red, but that's about to change because \"LE\" is the start of new words.\r\n\n<p>This builds 4 words:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left-to-right connections:<ul><li>PI + LE = PILE\r\n</li><li>LE + ND = LEND\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Top-to-bottom connections:<ul><li>STA + LE = STALE\r\n</li><li>LE + SS = LESS\r\n</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>For the words \"LEND\" and \"LESS\", the played card (LE) is the start of the word. Therefore, they (blue)\u00a0\u00a0gain control of the cards that make up the end of the word.\"SS\" and \"ND\" change to a blue color, to reflect this.</p>\n\n<strong>Downstream words change color. 4 points for the LE, and 1 point for the owner of each neighbor. </strong>\n\n<p>Scoring works as follows:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The current player (blue) receives 4 points because they played a card that made 4 words.\r\n</li><li>The blue player (who happens to also be the current player) receives 1 point for each of \"PI\", \"ND\", and \"SS\" cards (+3 points total)\u00a0 because they control those cards, and the cards were used to build words on this turn.<ul><li>Red does NOTreceive points for \"ND\", and yellow does NOTreceive points for \"SS\", because they lost control to blue. (Blue gets the points instead.)</li></ul></li><li>The yellow player receives 1 point for \"STA\" because they control that card, and it was used to build a word on this turn.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nEnd of Game\r\n<p>The game ends when a round is complete (i.e., all players have taken the same number of turns) AND at least 1 player has an EMPTY HAND..\r\n</p>\n<p>At the end of the game, players receive 1 BONUS POINT for each card on the GRID that is still in their control.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player with the highest score wins. If multiple players have the highest score, then they tie.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d044a51ab5beac938516d9a233ebf9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Plat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
