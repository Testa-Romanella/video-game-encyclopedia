You can select which drones cameras and servos/lights are active by clicking on the buttons in the bottom right.<br/></p><p>A game made for Ludum Dare 36, with the theme of Ancient Technology.</p><p>This was my first attempt at using Unity, and my first 3D Project too. There is no aim or objective to this game, but overall I am pretty pleased with the result. The rovers can explore, either separately or as a team, can sing call and responses, and can find each other with their blinking lights. There's more I would have liked to add to the game, but for a first project, I'd say I'm satisfied with the result. I hope you enjoy your brief visit to this world I've created!</p><p>Controls can be customised from the Unity starter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b09fdc5ce02759109593ab0f3ae29cf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RockhopperGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
