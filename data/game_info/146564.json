All this happens while Alice tries to cut some bread and plum- cake.</p>\n<p>This game has narration so audio is essential for you to understand both the story and the gameplay!</p>\n<p>I made this game a few years ago when I was an exchange student at WPI\u00a0with a collegue,\u00a0Tim Calvert, for a Game Design class hosted by Brian Moriarty. It uses an javascript engine called Perlenspiel that is basically a grid that you can change colors and handle clicks/mouse/keyboard events.</p>\n<p>Just download and then execute the cover.html (or game.html) to play the game!<br/></p>\n<p>Commands: Arrow keys to move and mouse to slice some food.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b444555e2b9987ab433ad1dda1e7bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fahrenheit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
