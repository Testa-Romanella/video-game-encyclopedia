I\u00a0didn't get as far as i expected, so i apologize if it isn't as chaotic as id have hoped. Please have fun!</p>\n<p>The main mechanic of the game is that you can mix up to three elements, (Fire, Ice, and Lightning), in specific orders to change how your main attack works. However, the stronger the potential mix becomes, the more dangerous it is to you as well!\u00a0<strong>Your own bullets can hurt you! </strong>A more complex explanation is at the bottom!<br/></p>\n<p>Additionally, every time you push an element out of your weapon, you will gain a stat increase! This of course means you will be changing your gun's attack frequently, if you wish to get strong enough to tackle later floors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Mouse - Aim/Fire</li></ul>\n<p>Elements - Your gun can hold up to 3 elements, with the order being important as to how the attack works. The order and element to get a certain effect is below:</p>\n<p>Slot 1:</p>\n<ul><li>Fire - Creates an explosion where an enemy or wall was hit</li><li>Ice - Releases shards where an enemy or wall was hit</li><li>Lightning - Damages the closest enemy or player where an enemy or wall was hit</li></ul>\n<p>Slot 2:</p>\n<ul><li>Fire - Leaves behind a flame where an enemy or wall was hit</li><li>Ice - Slows down a hit enemy</li><li>Lightning - Increases the speed of the bullet that was shot</li></ul>\n<p>Slot 3:</p>\n<ul><li>Fire - Makes the gun function like a flamethrower. Hold down the mouse button.</li><li>Ice - Creates multiple bullets that fire at an angle</li><li>Lightning - Makes the gun fire a beam, which pierces through foes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b0657993dd6d3ba25fa44912b6d3053a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
