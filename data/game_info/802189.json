Similar to those print-on-demand books where kids get to be the hero of the story, I wanted to make a game where my nieces and nephews could rescue Santa. Names have been changed for wider release, and my lips are sealed on whether anyone in my family can actually fly or is a seven-foot tall lizard man. </p>\n<p><strong>Asset Credits (besides the default RPGMaker ones):</strong></p><p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>a large number of links for assets for this project no longer function, so I have lost citations for some of the art (Santa sprite and face, Nelly's faces, the Lizard Man faces particularly).
