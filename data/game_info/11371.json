Using everything from stealth, weapons, searching, and sometimes strategy to achieve your objectives, your reflexes and ability to stay calm will be tested under pressure. But with patience and focus, you can achieve success!<br/><br/>Alfred Cypress has several locations around the world that are always in danger of a security breach or being hacked. This is due to what he has invented with energy sources as well as what he was currently working on. Because of these constant threats, he has created sub training areas away from the main training underground facility and hangars. This area is known as FILE 9. Here there are multiple programs, which include Transport Tunnel, Infiltrate and Destroy, Drone Evasion and others. Each has specific event possibilities to help be prepared and to overcome possible adversaries if necessary. <br/><br/>Lorna, who was adopted at birth, grew up not anything about her birth family.
