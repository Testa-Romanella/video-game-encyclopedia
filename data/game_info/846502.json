But for extra points it is worthy catch them all!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach match lasts three minutes where you have to smash as many synthesizer keys as you can and grab as many slimes as possible to get the highest score and have a chance to be on the top ten list. Each game difficulty level has its own leaderboard with top ten scores.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave fun smashing the synthesizers and squezing slimes !!!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T08:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b92de43137df76296539d10c80cf7749.jpg", "website": "https://mad-vf.com/smashthesynth", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabio Cecchini"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Fabio Cecchini"], "esrb_rating": null}
