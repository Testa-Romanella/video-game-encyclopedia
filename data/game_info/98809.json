{"id": 98809, "slug": "zero-gravity-free-run", "name": "Zero Gravity Free Run", "name_original": "Zero Gravity Free Run", "description": "<p>\r\n\tFor my first submission to the Ludum Dare community, and second game I have ever completed, I am fairly content with my finished product.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's funny, this game turned out completely different from what I expected. The first game idea I had when the theme \u201c10 seconds\" was announced was not a free running game that lacked gravity. In fact I first thought up of a game where you were a spy with an ability to slow down time all around you, thus making 10 seconds into around a minute and a half. The goal would be you have to infiltrate a corporate building and gather needed intel before the building's lock down procedure initiated. Either way, I figured that if time was slowed down by a significant enough degree, gravity would have less of an effect on the player and other physical objects, so I started to create an engine that would support gameplay mechanics in an environment with zero (or extremely low) gravity. That took me the whole of day 1. After completed, I got caught up for about a half hour just running my little pixelated character around aimlessly in this environment because the physics were so obscure and fun to mess around with. And after some thought I came to the conclusion; screw it, I'm gonna make a game based purely off of this zero gravity mechanic. So I rethought my idea and came up with this game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a880af1f85e488eec418b1c8c84ea47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tech-Nostalgic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
