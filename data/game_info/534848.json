Help the Ai Core to traverse the enviroment and adapt to ever new challanges. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p><p>Place Triggers so the Ai can interact with the enviroment and connect these trigers to the Ai's output Actions so it can react to the enviroment. Adapt on the fly and change how the Ai reacts to what kind of triggers are active and construct the best Neural Network. Add more layers so the Ai can evaluate more complex situation or expand on already unlocked layers so it can handle data per layer.</p><p>Also be carefull placed Triggers, they cannot be moved later you can only change how the Ai uses the signal from it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Current End of Jam Content:</strong><br/>- Main Menu<br/>- Tutorial<br/>- Level 1<br/>- Endless Mode</p>\n<p>- Fully funktional Neural Network with up to 5 layers<br/>-- Each Layer and the Unput is caped at 12 nodes<br/>-- 3 Different Actions the Ai can perform<br/>- Score and Upgrade Mechanic for NN<br/>- Procedual Generation of Level in Endless Mode<br/></p>\n<p>Missing Sound -&gt; Sry i am not good with that :,(<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4841a7db93f0f045cdc06480516d013d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prepe"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
