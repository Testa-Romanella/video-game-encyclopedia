Set in the underground of a Sci-fi society, two warring factions of machines fight to take control of the abandoned human environment. Controlled by their all-seeing AI's, they each unite the machines their control to lay siege\u00a0to the other opponent. Only one AI can thrive in the underground, but who will it be is decided by the players who command them!<br/></p>\n<p>In the game, two players each command an army of robots\u00a0tasked with destroying the other team\u2019s control tower. Via 3rd\u00a0person, the player physically leads their machines through using formations that possess both strengths and weaknesses. Each formation is effective against another but can also be countered, leading to a careful game of strategy. Vigilance is key, for the opponent will also be trying to counter you so plan carefully and act accordingly. Victory will be achieved when the opponent's AI lies destroyed, so only your machines rule the underground!<br/><br/>If you can spare a moment, the team would greatly appreciate your feedback via our survey!<br/></p>\n<p>Game Survey</p>\r\nSupported Software\r\n\r\nMade by AIE Graduating Class of 2020!\r\n<p>https://aieseattle.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>AIE is a non-profit educator established in 1996 to grow and support the game industry. Our unique curriculum is offered in the United States and Australia, and provides you with the training needed to join our other graduates as entrepreneurs, leaders, and innovators in the video game and film industries. We were one of the first colleges in the world to offer specialized training for 3D animation and video game development.<br/></p>\n<p>A collaborative effort made from across the classes, students work together to create a video-game as their final\u00a0in the second year. The games originality, design, art, and systems are all created by the students who are grouped together from across the classes. After conception, the game is\u00a0pitched to the school faculty as a production piece where they work through the industry pipeline to see the game created. From there, they proceed into the industry pipeline consisting of pre-production, development, testing, and finally release.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Caleb Shaw</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Art Lead</li><li>Level Artist</li><li>Technical Art</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cooper Hall</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Game Design Lead</li><li>Level Design</li><li>Audio</li></ul>\n<p><strong>David Warford</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Build Development</li><li>AI Programming</li><li>Systems Design</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jacob Neptune</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Animation</li><li>Tower Design</li><li>Producer</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jennamarie Hunter</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Prop Artist</li><li>Texture Artist</li><li>UI Artist</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Joe Largent</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Character Artist</li><li>Concept Art</li><li>Rigging</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Noah Albright<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming Lead</li><li>UI Systems</li><li>System Bugs and Tweaks</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tyrese Buckhanon</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Design</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Shaders</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d1323d0d0b0e1b5944c60cf8cb6eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caliber5", "AIE Seattle", "Cooper Hall", "Tyrese Buckhanon", "Jacob Neptune", "redstonedash", "a9wink", "JHunter18"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
