The controls are shown on the first level, and from there you can figure it all out. I am still new to game development when making this though, so it might not be that good. Also all the art is made with the default godot icon.</p>\n\n<p>To install on windows, extract the zip file, open the folder in there, and run the exe.</p>\n<p>On the web version of the game the door at the end of level 3 is bugged. This only happens on the html5 version and not on the windows version. Sorry, and I dont know how to fix this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T08:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/2983ba0d166188c22c751d54e584d482.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeroHunter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
