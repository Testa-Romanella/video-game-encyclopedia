{"id": 102560, "slug": "fuckhead", "name": "FUCKHEAD", "name_original": "FUCKHEAD", "description": "<p>\"FUCKHEAD\" is an experimental video game in which you play as an exploded-head man who wanders surreal black and white landscapes in a search for Clonazepam (an anti anxiety suppressant) all the while trying to find moments of clarity. This game can be seen as an interlude between sexual frustration and boredom, a netherworld burdened by the pounding weight of anxiety. It is more or less an interactive continuation of the voyeuristic <em>Supersexhibition</em> video that I created in 2015 (the video can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/134059426).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2be72ffcd9c2f162d97cfac6c1486c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["josh roach"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
