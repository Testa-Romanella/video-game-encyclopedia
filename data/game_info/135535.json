For this I have used children's drawing, with little detail of the surroundings, simple animations that transmit the mood of Emeka with music of Bob Marley.</p>\n<p>For the change of emotions (crying, laughter and sleep) I have programmed a small script that is based on the positions that he likes most depending on his mood. A clue, If you are getting him to sleep and shaking him over your arms you have a good chance of waking him up ;)</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get Emeka to fall asleep, so it concludes with an \"Emeka Wins\".</p>\n<p>This is a flatgame following the rules of\u00a0FlatGame Annual 2016<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861e5c80dad41a667b92b20c1af2eccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gonztirado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
