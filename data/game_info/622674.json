A classic galactic conquest and turn-based strategy video game where you are the leader of a race of intelligent beings building large spaceships for interplanetary and interstellar travel through warp points between star systems.<br/>\nThe first Space Empires game was created by Aaron Hall in 1993 as a pet project based on his love for other space strategy games. After playing around with that game, Aaron decided to add features and make this prototype a bit more playable. After a year of work, the game was interesting enough that with a little more work, it could be public worthy. In 1995, Aaron Hall formed the company known as \u201cMalfador Machinations\u201d to release the game Space Empires II.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpace Empires II<br/>\nExplore the galaxy, discover and colonize new planets to acquire enough resources. Design your ships, choosing from different hulls, weapons, shields, and several devices. Once you advance with technologies, new systems will be available, and you will have to update your designs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpace Empires III<br/>\nThe third game within the Space Empires series brings the dawn of a new age of exploration. Your race keeps running through the fabric of space and moves to other solar systems beyond your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpace Empires IV Deluxe<br/>\nTake up the mantle of command as Galactic Emperor. It is up to you to discover new planets ripe for colonization, encourage scientific discovery, and quell the occasional rebellion. Rest assured that you will not only be challenged from within as you\u2019ll have the galaxy\u2019s other inhabitants to compete with for territory and profit. Some will want to wage only war while others will be more than willing to negotiate. As a strong leader, you\u2019ll have to achieve victory or wave the white flag and prepare your surrender to enemies whose plans are more cunning than your own!\n<br/><br/> Space Empires IV Deluxe is a grand strategy title in the space 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) genre.

You can research technology, design new ships, wage war on a tactical level, put down rebellions, meet and greet new species, and much more.
