I'm fairly new to game development and I just recently started doing it more frequently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by Space Invaders and was made in 4 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You move left by pressing the a/arrow key left and right by pressing the d/arrow key right, you can shoot with the w/arrow key up. The game is an endless space Shoot'Em Up where you try to get a good high score.</p>\n<p>And I designed the game for 1080p. If you have a higher resolution there might be some UI issues.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have some tips for me please leave a comment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for stopping by my game and taking the time to read this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry if my English is not the best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits to Garo from Team D-13\u00a0\u00a0for the\u00a0Soundtrack(Shelf Space) that I used.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T13:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c98b82faefcf8bdde6951753672e72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["0FENX0"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
