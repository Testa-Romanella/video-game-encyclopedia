With problem after problem causing delays, Novice Ambrosius is close to giving up on graduating. Help him find the answers he needs to complete the ritual once and for all in this short, dialogue-heavy visual novel.</p>\n<p><em>Wizard School Woes</em> was made in 72 hours for Minimalism Jam, and includes graphical assets by AnankeKeirin, Rachel Chen, Jaime Scribbles, fsy, and Wenrexa. Because of the time constraints, I didn't end up adding any music or sound effects, so feel free to listen to your own playlist of cool songs about wizards while you read!</p><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong> There seems to be a bug with the \"options\" button on the main menu. In order to access the options menu, please instead start or load the game, and then access options from either the quick menu or the pause menu (by hitting escape first). This will be fixed in a future update after the judging period for the game jam is over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T11:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b71451479e99311b0576db10f2424ac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jane Titor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
