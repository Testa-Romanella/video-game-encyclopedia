Life was simple until he was contacted by Polygod, the god of polygons. Polygod tells Peter of a new console that will feature Super Monster Fighter 3\u2026 and new graphics! Super Monster Fighter 3 must be stopped to keep customer attention on Super Monster Fighter 2. Polygod declares Peter as his prophet, and Peter journeys across the three realms to stop the new game. However, Peter is not the strongest, so he will eventually die. When he dies, a new prophet will take his place (renaming the title of the game), and follow Peter\u2019s footsteps.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Attack - Left Click</p>\n<p>Dodge Roll - Space Bar</p>\n<p>Pet Enemies - Right Click (essentially does nothing)</p>\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music Player featuring hits from the one and only ojman654!!!</p>\n<p>3 Action-Packed Realms</p>\n<ul><li>Realm 1 (Super Monster Fighter 2) - Peter's Home</li><li>Realm 2 (Super Monster Fighter 1) - the origins of the future (deep) (know your history)</li><li>Realm 3 (Super Monster Fighter 3) - the threat to polygonal life as Peter knows it</li></ul>\n<p>3 Action-Packed Combat Rooms</p>\n<ul><li>Town</li><li>Forest</li><li>Farm</li></ul>\n<p>3 Action-Packed Weapons</p>\n<ul><li>Sword</li><li>Axe</li><li>Mace</li></ul>\n<p>3 Action-Packed Times of Day</p>\n<ul><li>Day</li><li>Afternoon</li><li>Night</li></ul>\n<p>Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnddddd</p>\n<p>Varied action-packed randomly-generated customization!</p>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>For some reason, sometimes the player can play as Peter's ghost.
