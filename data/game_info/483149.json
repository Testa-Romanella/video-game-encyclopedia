We only have one other game under our belt and we're both relatively new to Unity. We had a huge headache with collisions which took up an entire session of development and ran out of time to make a third level, main menu, credits screen, fix the camera and the additional polish we wish we could have committed.\u00a0We've also had dozens of roadblocks along the way. We were just too ambitious with the scale of the project. After all, that's the wonder of game development, live and learn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's been a hard week and we've learnt a lot. There will probably be a bunch of bugs in the game but overall it's playable and hopefully you enjoy it. We just want to say it's been great to be a part of this game jam and we hope everyone else got something out of this and we look forward to playing everyone else's submissions.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Miziziziz and\u00a0everyone that made this happen</p>\n<p>Wez &amp; Tom - DoubleTom Games</p>\n<strong>Credits<br/></strong>\n<p>Art Assets:\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack<br/>Sound Effects &amp; Music:\u00a0https://opengameart.org<br/>Game Engine:\u00a0https://unity.com<br/><br/>Special thanks to all the voice actors:<br/>- Michael Bevon - Squidgies<br/>- Liam Clarkson - Goliaths<br/>- Hal Cozens - Dark Wizards<br/>- Andy Wareing - Keith the Dark Wizard<br/></p>\n<strong>Contact &amp; Links</strong>\n<p>Twitter<br/></p>\n<p>Instagram<br/></p>\n<p>Facebook<br/></p>\n<p>YouTube</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/3591a83852976674769e509887105934.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DoubleTom"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
