This game is sort of like my high-fantasy take on the story. ^_^ I hope that you enjoy! :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story</strong>:</p>\n<p>Once upon a time in a faraway forest, there lived a poor family that has two twin children: Hansel and Gretel. The twins' parents have been in an economic struggle for a very long time, and they decided to take the twins out in the woods to abandon them and free themselves from the burden of feeding the twins. Fortunately, Hansel left a trail of white stones from where they left which helped them return home, but, the Mother was angered with their return and decided to take the twins out on the woods again to abandon them once more. With Hansel leaving behind a trail of breadcrumbs, will this help them find their way back home again?<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fe</strong><strong>atures</strong>:</p>\n<p>- Very short and sweet</p>\n<p>- Challenging, strategic and engaging battles</p>\n<p>- Beautiful fairy-tale-esque artworks</p>\n<p>- Beautiful Celtic music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac4164084af1ee25b3c2f511aaf217e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starmage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
