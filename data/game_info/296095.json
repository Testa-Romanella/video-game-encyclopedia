After reports of mirklings meddling in the marchlands, the Aldermen of Glimrike order the local holy men to bannish the blight. In a last gasp of hope, the witch Berthilda is sent to a small island off the shores to the south. With the only bridge collapsed long ago, the shadow has since begun to fester there. She climbs onto a rickety raft, her holy wand in one hand, a small sword in the other, and she sets off to face the dim.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Guide the witch Berthilda across the shores of the blighted island. Channel her spirit to bring light to the mirklings, and slay them one by one, casting them into holy flames.
