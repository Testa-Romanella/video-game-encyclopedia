They were thought of as strange demonic beings that didn't have any sort of place in normal human life, but as time passed, so did this rigid stereotype slowly dissolve with it.  Fast forward to the present time, Monster Girls have become an integral and irreplaceable part of human life, and can be found in many difference facets of society. One particular aspect that has drawn much attention (and criticism), is that of the  domestication of Monster Girls as pets.  In this game, the player will be able to experience what it would be like to have a monster girl as a pet for themselves.<br/><br/>***ALL INFORMATION BELOW HERE IS CURRENTLY OUTDATED AND WILL BE UPDATED SOON***<h3>Characters</h3><br/>There's the standard slime girl, nekomata, mouse girl, sheep girl \u2013 but there are also the more exotic and rarer ones as well: a caterpillar girl, a mandragora, a spriggan, with many more to come in the future.<h3>Gameplay / Features</h3><br/>The core gameplay loop revolves around having conversations with the monster girls, seeing them in various situations (embarrassing, funny, lewd, etc), and interacting with them by way of a minigame.<br/><br/><ul><li>3D monster girls that you can talk to and interact with</li></ul><br/><ul><li>open world to explore</li></ul><br/><ul><li>In-depth dialogues, with the option to skip them</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Headpatting minigame, as well as many others</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Encounter many cute and adorable scenarios with the girls</li></ul><h3>Information</h3><br/>I currently have the game organized by episodes, starting with number 0000. Initially, I was using that system arbitrarily just to keep track of different pieces of code that belonged to an earlier or later part of the game, but now I intend to structure the entire game's design and story by individual episode numbers \u2013 with each episode being one interaction (something like a story beat in screenwriting) that takes place with one or more monster girls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T17:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/102cf182c36e4da976aa4d9a66d55e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sclavus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Sclavus"], "esrb_rating": null}
