There are bits that I wasn't able to implement during the jam that I'd like to come back to once the rating period ends. (Specifically, making a sprout sprite for each plant to simulate growth stages, and maybe adding watering?\u00a0Something to make the game a little more interactive.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like the general idea, but have feedback for what could be changed / improved / added upon, I'd love to hear it!\u00a0And if you notice any bugs, feel free to point those out too :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks\u00a0&amp; I\u00a0hope you enjoy this tiny garden simulator!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef88498299554fa13779554f29cd9685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DuckDuckGrem"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
