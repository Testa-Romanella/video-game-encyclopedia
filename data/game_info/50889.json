The idea of the game came from a mistake in my original code, that caused the spinning. After some playing around with it I figured out I could make quite an interesting game. Now that I have had more time and had the game tested by my friends, I figured that with some more work on it, that I could publish the game. So the 20 levels that are in the game, also know as the old levels are the original levels from the first time I made the game.<h3>Game Features to come</h3><ul><li> Customization<br/></li><li> Level editor<br/></li><li> Steam workshop <br/></li><li> Online multiplayer<br/></li><li> Split screen multiplayer<br/></li><li> Game modes<br/></li><li> Story mode<br/></li><li> Lots of levels<br/></li><li> Music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T04:26:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c2/4c24f4f4652d32e7519a4f9d60629e9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 212, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Old Keyboard", "BotTiny"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Old Keyboard", "BotTiny"], "esrb_rating": null}
