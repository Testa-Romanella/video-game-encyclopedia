But there is a bug where if you have used the speed power-up, it throws clocks off sync and it doesn't fully rewind the player. The game is still beatable, even 100% with this glitch. We're sorry we couldn't fix it, we only figured out what caused the issue on the last day, when our programmer in charge of the time manipulation was not availave.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b11a2a8ebd9f9eb24d76dea1c0049b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Catralitos", "FenixDS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
