The enemy will roll for a new permanent buff every time you kill it. When you run out of energy you will roll for a random new weapon. You can also dodge bullets by dashing (you are invulnerable while dashing). The enemy will also spawn some additional enemies that do not get temporary buffs when they die. These additional enemies are not required kills.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys to move</li><li>Left click to shoot</li><li>Shift/Right click to dash</li></ul>\r\nAttributions\r\n<p><strong>Sound<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Many sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com</strong></li><li>Some additional sound effects that I need to dig up the attributions for when I'm more awake</li><li>Music by Alexadr Zhelanov</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Art<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Particle effects from https://www.kenney.nl/</strong></li><li>Beam icon by Lorc</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/9127c82b65868c791b06c3ff6d962674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Durbo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
