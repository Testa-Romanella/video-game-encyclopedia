The city wants to get rid of the house quickly and make up the back taxes, but before that happens, the house might need some work to make it safe to sell.</p>\n<p>Enter the Atterson Street House and perform a loose inspection to determine if the house is salvageable or if the house should be demolished and sold as land. The house has been a fixture in the area for a while, featuring in many urban legends and ghost stories, but that's not really your thing. You once had a friend who was really into all that, but it seems like a distant memory these days.</p>\n<p>======</p>\n<p>Veiled is an interactive fiction piece about exploring a (probably) haunted house. There are many things to inspect, and you might want to label the rooms as you go. Pay close attention to your environment, and you might want to take some notes!\u00a0But watch out! You never know what might be lurking around the corner.</p>\n<p>Playing Veiled consists of reading passages and clicking links. You will collect items along the way, use items with the environment, and make choices. Veiled has two main play areas: the passage and the sidebar. In the passage, you'll read descriptions of places in the house and objects of note. In the sidebar, you'll find your briefcase containing your collected items. Clicking on an item in your inventory will bring it out, showing a description and occasional actions you can perform.\u00a0You can also label areas by clicking the \"Somewhere\" link just under the title card in the sidebar.</p>\n<p>Veiled works best in Chrome on a desktop computer, but should work well enough on mobile and in any modern browser. If you typically browse with JavaScript disabled, then you'll need to enable it to enjoy this game. Veiled was made in Twine\u00a02.3.9, using the SugarCube story format version 2.31.1. Additionally, this project used a (somewhat modified) version of Casement, A popup-focused extension for SugarCube that I wrote.\u00a0Veiled was created for A Game By Its Cover 2020. It was inspired by the famicase \"Veiled\" by Dan Ingman.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:32:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26fa7550df3b637d5bc318b7d98546e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
