Also that I\u00a0am really really interested in networking, but it takes an enormous amount of energy for me to focus on the process.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next time I'll probably just buy the asset store package.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>[very messy unity project as zip folder - no downloadable .exe as it still requires me to boot up a server - web side located at charlotte-harper.com/game.html ]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/3937d049de9c401a33286b49f3409450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charlie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
