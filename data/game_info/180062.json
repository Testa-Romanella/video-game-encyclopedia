Through the magical powers of rhetoric, you can send your friend out to the village to turn the undecided townsfolk to your side. But watch out! Every turn, there's a chance a villager will join an angry mob.</p><p>The game ends when all villagers are affiliated, either as your friends, or with the mob. If you managed to build up a group of friends larger than the quickly-growing mob, you win!</p><p><strong>John Benman @johntheperson - art</strong></p><p><strong>Ben Gemmel @paracatgames - code</strong></p><p>Fonts used with open license:<br/></p><p>Caviar Dreams - dialog http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Caviar-Dreams</p><p>Pusab - titles http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Pusab</p><p>Music used with open license:</p><p>\"Tell The Future\" by Cory Gray - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Cory_Gray/Carcra...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298dec175b3ad87eaba80f2882dcc8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paracatgames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
