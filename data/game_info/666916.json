The themes of the jam:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Limitation: <strong>Boss </strong>- The captain of the cargo cruiser sends you on a dangerous mission to recover cargo around a black hole, and he\u00a0won't stop contacting you. There's a bug in the IT system that blocks radar during incoming transmissions. The player is therefore blind to the radar during these periodic transmissions. The boss transmits typical annoying office type messages. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Theme: <strong>On the edge</strong> - You start off on the edge of the event horizon of a black hole which is constantly pulling you and everything else towards it. You can only fully escape using a hyperdrive which requires a lot of\u00a0fuel and permission from the boss (a satisfactory amount of cargo recovered)</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Keyboard Controls<br/></strong>\n<ul><li>Thrust: W</li><li>Rotate Left/Right: A/D</li><li>Fire Laser: E</li><li>Engage Hyperdrive (when enabled): R</li><li>Arrow keys (for movement) and spacebar (laser) also work</li></ul>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>Any assets not listed below have been created from scratch\u00a0for this project</p>\n<ul><li>Modified image of a blackhole used in final scene -https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13326</li><li>A starry background (pexels-jacub-gomez-1142950) used on several scenes - Photo by Jacub Gomez from Pexels</li><li>Music \u00a0from https://freemusicarchive.org\u00a0under CC0:\u00a0<ul><li>sawsquarenoise - OST 05 Go Go Go</li><li>sawsquarenoise - RottenMage SpaceJacked OST JINGLE 01</li><li>Daniel Birch - Alone Once Again</li></ul></li><li>Music in game loop\u00a0\"Screen Saver\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) under CC0</li><li>Hyperdrive sound \"468904__shark-anthony__phased-sonic-boom\" by\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Shark_Anthony/sounds/468904/</li><li>Multiple sprites and fonts taken from and modified by Kenney\u00a0www.kenney.nl</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/sci-fi-sounds</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux\n<ul><li>fire11</li><li>fire14\u00a0</li><li>fire1</li><li>Enemy-1\u00a0(derived from this)\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0SpacePlayer (derived from this)\u00a0</li><li>engine2\u00a0</li><li>kenvector_future_thin\u00a0</li><li>kenvector_future\u00a0</li><li>Crate-Powerup (derived from this)</li><li>\u00a0Cash-Powerup (derived from this)\u00a0</li><li>meteorBrown_big4\u00a0</li><li>laserRed05\u00a0</li><li>laserGreen14\u00a0</li><li>laserBlue14</li><li>grey_button13</li><li>grey_button04</li><li>black (dervived from this)</li><li>lowFrequency_explosion_000 powerUp2</li><li>sfx_shieldUp</li><li>struck_alarm</li><li>transmit_alert</li><li>thrusterFire_004</li><li>LaserLarge_004</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad462be6e0c5e97f5448a8ccf39f9ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Dridex", "FalconJon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
