This game is heavily dependent upon score saving, and the HTML version won't save your scores after you close the tab. Additionally, the\u00a0 Windows build allows you to import levels other people have created using the level editor. That said, there isn't a build for Linux or MacOS at the moment, so this web build is available for those not running windows.</p>\n<p>If you do use the web version, note that there are some issues currently with the window when it loses focus; clicking off of it will freeze the game. Reloading the page fixes this. Also,\u00a0the fullscreen option might not work perfectly.</p>\n<p>More levels! The game comes bundled with 15 unique levels, but you can find more levels below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb499228ca78685de37de235be6cc991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["hampurdolp"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
