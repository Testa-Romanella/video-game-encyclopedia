One day, a long, meaty cock appeared in between her legs. Ashamed of her new member, she became a shut-in and avoided opening up to other people. The fact that she has to beat her meat multiple times a day to stay sane doesn&#39;t help either. She now works at a restaurant and bar, where no one else knows about her little (huge) problem.<br />\nIt&#39;s been several years now, and Emily has realized that unless she makes a change in her life soon, all she will have to look forward to is constant masturbation and loneliness. Help her overcome her fears and get her to open up to her co-workers. Perhaps in time they will open up (their legs) to her as well.<br />\nEmily used to be an outgoing girl until she woke up one day and found she had something extra between her legs. Ashamed of her body, she became withdrawn and antisocial. No one else knows about her secret, but she feels like unless she does something soon, she may become a shut-in chronic masturbator for the rest of her life.<br />\nThe party girl who never grew up and a waitress at the same restaurant Emily works at. Cindy\u2019s life is a blur of drinks, loud music, and partying. All she wants out of life can be found on a dance floor. Emily and she do not know each other that well, even though Cindy is constantly trying to drag her out to one club or another. She often wonders how Emily turned out the way she was and how anyone could lead such a boring life.<br />\nTall, athletic, and outgoing, Clover doesn\u2019t let anything get in the way of what she wants to do. She works at the same restaurant as Emily and has known her for a few years. She always invites Emily to do things with her, most of which Emily declines. However, the two of them may learn that they\u2019re more like each other than they suspect.<br />\nClover\u2019s older sister. Lilly doesn\u2019t appear to have a job, yet appears to always have money to burn through. She has appeared a few times at the restaurant and found Emily\u2019s shy and withdrawn manner to be endearing. She is a deeply affectionate and caring older sister and spends much time wondering how Clover is doing.<br />\nThe co-owner and manager of the restaurant. Rachael at a glance seems like a serious, business-oriented woman who does not tolerate any nonsense. However, Emily often gets the impression that she\u2019s just putting on a front and doesn\u2019t show her true personality when she\u2019s at work. Rachael suspects much the same of Emily or thinks that she is hiding something about herself. She intends to get to the truth of the matter one day.Main Features<br />\nHD 1080p &amp; Fullscreen options<br />\nVisual Novel/ Point and click<br />\n2+ hours of content<br />\n20+ illustrated scenes with animations<br />\nFully voiced characters<br />\nCG Gallery<br />\nExtras and secrets<br />\nOriginal Soundtrack and audio<br />\nLanguage options</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T12:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9b0/9b0c29bc13efb54952de862b240d17a1.jpg", "website": "https://www.kupaastudios.com/futa-fix/", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 62, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyberframe Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Critical Bliss", "Kupaa Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
