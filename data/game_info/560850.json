The original 3 levels from the tutorial build were expanded into their own unique levels.<br/>2. 3 additional unique levels were added for a total of 6 levels within the \"New Game\" story.<br/>3. An \"Endless Mode,\" available only through the \"Level Select\" screen.<br/>4. Created a boss enemy with two behaviors, one for each \"phase\" (1 per each of the final two levels, Level 5 and Level 6).<br/>5. Added a \"Game Win Screen\" after completing level 6, to tie in with the game's minor story.<br/>6. Each level's pause menu has unique text, detailing the 'story' and clear conditions.<br/>7. Gave the \"Instructions\" button on the Main Menu an actual description of the game, complete with controls, an 'overview of the story,' and some bonus information.<br/>8. The Main Menu now has a nice-looking background that is not just a flat blue color.<br/>9. As stated in \"Instructions,\" two little background pieces were hidden in each stage. This is incredibly minor and gives no bonus other than self-achievement, but I figured I'd note it.<br/><br/>Credits:<br/>Created by Elex McCoy<br/>Game Assets from CAS 117</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:37:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9bdfcc3635a032845956a468ccf1ae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ElexMcCoy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
