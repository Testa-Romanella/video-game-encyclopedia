The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc93f073f082a5a6223a3d3cb1e0c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fernando Ruiz Gimenez"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
