Take control of a street gang and order your recruits to attack, defend or even do a little safe-cracking to pick up some needed cash. Use that cash to buy nastier weapons and take down your punk enemies in this intense first-person shooter. Being the Kingpin is half attitude and all action.<br />\nStart your own gang and recruit right from the streets. If a new gang member turns out to be a punk, blast him and make room for new ones. Move up in the world, but watch out for the Kingpin; eventually you&#39;re going to have to take him on.<br />\nSomewhere in a past that never crossed paths with the future lies the world of the Kingpin. Burned out buildings and urban decay are the landscape. Local gangs roam the streets, protecting their turf and scoping out opportunities.<br />\nSome of the features include<br />\n16-player multiplayer action via LAN or Internet<br />\nLocation-specific damage \u2014 shoot a snitch in the kneecaps or snuff out a rival with a head-shot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-09T21:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42c73f56c4c80e92cbfcafb5b3ee0717.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 215, "beaten": 30, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 25, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 52, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Xatrix Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
