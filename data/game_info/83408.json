Unfortunately, most of us at some time or another will have a cavity that needs to be filled. Dental fillings are the most common type of dental procedure that is used to help to reduce the bacteria in the mouth, extend the life of the tooth, and hopefully avoid the need for more serious dental work. During this interactive dental filling procedure, you will remove the decay around the cavity with the dental drill and choose the type of filling (amalgam or composite) that our patient will receive. During recovery, your patient will likely experience some sensitivity, but with the proper care, this will go away, and subsequent decay and pain can be avoided. Put on your gloves and grab your drill!<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u2022Highly interactive virtual dentistry<br/>\u2022Inject, drill, and fill your way to a new tooth!<br/>\u2022Interactive preparation and procedure!<br/>\u2022Great for kids &amp; adults", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d5cca109a90944ee7520c3608a07d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Clearly Trained"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Clearly Trained"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
