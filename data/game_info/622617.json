I wish I had full 360 radial movement, a boost, a double jump, and slow-motion capabilities...\u201d? <br/><br/>If so, then I AM DIE is the game for you!<br/><br/>Set across a series of surreal floating islands with procedurally-generated musical soundscapes, I AM DIE is a physics-based 3D puzzle platformer in which you must find, release, and guide a ball to its goal, weaving your way through an increasingly fiendish set of ramps, tubes, conveyors, and other obstacles.<br/><br/>But each roll of the dice counts toward your final score, so as you explore and progress, you must battle against the forces of randomness to keep your level-complete time FAST and your roll-score LOW! <br/><br/>With over fifty main levels (and a few secret ones), I AM DIE is a game that\u2019s easy to play and difficult to master, and may have you tearing your hair out every time you delicately guide yourself toward a \u201cone\u201d and inexplicably land on a \u201csix\u201d.<br/><br/>No microtransactions. No pay to win. No skins or hats or online multiplayer or global rankings. Just good old fashioned platforming fun from an era gone by.<br/><br/><strong><ul><li> Tightly programmed and expansive controls.<br/></li><li> Over 50 unique levels.<br/></li><li> Procedurally generated music.<br/></li><li> No upgrades.
