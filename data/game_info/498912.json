Your goal is to collect pictures of eight special places, before you return to your car.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You will find the list of your target landmarks in your notebook. There, you can also find a map, which you can use to navigate the environment. However, be aware that you will actually have to navigate, as the map won't show your location. If you are near a landmark of interest, or have found something else you find interesting, you can take out your camera and snap a picture of it. These pictures will appear in your notebook.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W, A, S, D - move around</p>\n<p>move mouse - look around</p>\n<p>right mouse button - toggle camera mode</p>\n<p>left mouse button - take photo (in camera mode)</p>\n<p>esc / tab - open notebook</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>A game by SelinaDev<br/>Link: https://twitter.com/SelinaDev</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Kalimba Relaxation Music by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5711-kalimba-relaxation-music<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Clear Waters by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3516-clear-waters<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Elf Meditation Preview by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5728-elf-meditation-preview<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\r\nSound Effects\r\n<p>Book sounds from:<br/>RPG Audio by Kenney Vleugels<br/>Link: https://kenney.nl/assets/rpg-audio<br/></p>\n<p>Footstep sounds from:<br/>Foot Walking Step Sounds on Stone, Water, Snow, Wood and Dirt by Jute<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/foot-walking-step-sounds-on-stone-water-snow-woo...</p>\n<p>Bird sounds from:<br/>Ambient Bird Sounds by isaiah658<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/ambient-bird-sounds<br/><br/>Camera sound from:<br/>Camera by themightyglider<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/camera</p>\n<p>Ocean sounds from:<br/>Beach Ocean Waves by jasinski<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/beach-ocean-waves</p>\n<p>Waterfall sounds from:<br/>Ambient Mountain, River, Wind, and Forest and Waterfall by Blender Foundation<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/ambient-mountain-river-wind-and-forest-and-wate...</p>\n<p>Car door sound from:<br/>Car_door_sfx by looneybits<br/>Link: https://opengameart.org/content/cardoorsfx</p>\r\nVisuals\r\n<p>Font<br/>Funtype by Frank Baranowski<br/>Link: https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/funtype</p>\n<p>Color Palette<br/>CC-29 Palette by Alpha6<br/>Link: https://lospec.com/palette-list/cc-29</p>\r\nTools\r\n<p>Game Engine<br/>Godot Game Engine<br/>Link: https://godotengine.org</p>\n<p>3D Modelling<br/>Blender<br/>Link: https://blender.org</p>\n<p>Vector Graphics<br/>Inkscape<br/>Link: https://inkscape.org</p>\n<p>Audio Editing<br/>Audacity<br/>Link: https://audacityteam.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae37935f06159bf922d6b6abd40b3564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Selina"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
