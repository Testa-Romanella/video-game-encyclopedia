{"id": 314162, "slug": "omeganaut", "name": "OMEGANAUT", "name_original": "OMEGANAUT", "description": "<p>You are the last pilot of the Earth Alliance, our only resort: the Omeganaut!<br/></p>\n<p>What I intend to do with Omeganaut is to create a roguelike kind of game out of a 3D Rail Shooter. I take inspiration from Starfox (Super Nintendo) and from classic arcade shooters.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Fast paced gameplay with randomly generated levels</li><li>No loading time, no cuts between levels</li><li>VR : Put on your favorite headset and play the game in glorious 3D</li><li>Small footprint : the entire game can fit inside a good old floppy disk</li></ul>\n\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>It is recommended to play Omeganaut using a gamepad with analog joystick. But you can also play with a digital pad, a keyboard or even a touchscreen. Just activate the virtual gamepad in the Setup screen.</p>\n<ul><li>Move around to avoid obstacles</li><li>Only one button to fire and destroy everything that comes in your way</li><li>Press the roll buttons to turn faster</li><li>Double tap the roll button to DO A BARREL ROLL!<br/>(Barrel rolls are handy to avoid danger and to slap nearby obstacles)</li></ul>\n\r\nVirtual Reality\r\n<p>You can turn on VR in the Setup screen. I only have a Google Cardboard, but it should work with fancy headsets such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Please give me feedback if you have the chance to play with such a device!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDevelopment note\r\n<p>Omeganaut is still under construction. Right now, I focus on making the engine good and getting rid of all the bugs, while adding new enemy ships now and then. When there will be enough content, I\u2019ll focus on writing rules in order to produce nice levels instead of spawning everything randomly.</p>\n\n<p>Omeganaut is developed using the awesome ZGameEditor engine, which allows a tiny footprint, and two external\u00a0libraries for\u00a0physics and modular music.<br/></p>\n<p>ZGameEditor by Ville Krumlinde :\u00a0http://www.zgameeditor.org<br/>ZgeBullet by Radovan Cervenka :\u00a0https://github.com/Rado-1/ZgeBullet<br/>SunVox by Alexander Zolotov :\u00a0http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:48:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a5357ec79acaf34874ba8b5bd80e3c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Txori"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
