Just knowing that people are playing the game is more than enough but I would appreciate it if you took the time to give it a rating.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Incipient Foes</em> was a concept I came up with pretty soon after the theme was announced. I decided that, instead of coming up with one or two amazing game mechanics and spending most of my time on creating levels and exploring the concept like a \u201cgood\u201d game developer, I would try to create a game with near-infinite scope. I want, procedurally generated levels, enemy AI implemented with machine learning, multiplayer, open world, VR support, a battle-royale mode, etc. That said, I don't know how to do most of that. So I'm going to focus on creating the start menu and hope the rest follows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I may not have been able to add everything I wanted, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/877522bfadac12d751620f8276a72f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lapatron"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
