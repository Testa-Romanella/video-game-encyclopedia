{"id": 291535, "slug": "retro-attorney", "name": "Retro Attorney", "name_original": "Retro Attorney", "description": "<p>This is a currently incomplete game intended to be in the style of the Ace Attorney series, but absurdly low-res. The idea was to make a serious drama/satire juxtaposed with presentation that makes no sense.</p>\n<p>The current build doesn't work and was uploaded basically just because the game jam that inspired it (which should be displayed automatically) was about to end. A whole bunch of things went wrong during the 2-week time period, including me suffering a back injury, and by the time I finally got to making a build of the engine, I found out the menu system flat-out didn't work. I tried skipping over the main menu straight to new-game only to find out the text didn't work either.</p>\n<p>I plan to keep working on this, if only because the intended story is enjoyable to work on, but unfortunately, it's not in a state where anyone else can enjoy the story yet. I also intend to adjust how the images are accomplished (they're procedural, not embedded or external) to get the file size down to a more sensible level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84bff28e6ed0adeecdeec9543fed9f60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin EUMP"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
