{"id": 18848, "slug": "hector-episode-1", "name": "Hector: Episode 1", "name_original": "Hector: Episode 1", "description": "<p>Hector Episode 1, subtitled We Negotiate With Terrorists, is the first chapter of a three-part episodic quest by Straandlooper. You play as Hector, a police officer, permanently drunk and doesn\u2019t fit the description of a \u201cgood cop\u201d. However, this time the police needs Hector\u2019s help because only he can calm down a very nervous sniper.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to hold a successful negotiation with a terrorist who keeps hostages and kills passers-by. The story is based on a series of quests. There aren\u2019t many environmental puzzles while some decisions are not quite clear; instead, the game focuses on dialogues. Choosing the right lines can lead you to solving multiple issues and simplify your way to the goal. </p>\n<p>The game is created in 2D cartoonish style but it\u2019s restricted for kids. Hector is full of dirty humor and controversial situations. This tone is kept in other two episodes subtitled Senseless Acts of Justice and Beyond Reasonable Doom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-19T16:39:21", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 2.24, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 1388, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 38, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Straandlooper"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
