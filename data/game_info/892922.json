After inadvertantly upsetting their mad scientist roommate, their consciousness is downloaded into a robotic battle maiden known as a S.E.R.A. unit. And yes, they're now a female robotic battle maiden. If that wasn't bad enough, they've now been dragged into a magical dimension known as The Frakk and forced to take part in a civil war between opposing monster girl tribes. <br/><br/>Being a robotic battle maiden is honestly kind of cool, once you get past the abject humiliation of the whole situation. Being forced to obey the orders of your criminally insane roommate is a bit of a drawback though, as is being forced to refer to her as 'Mistress Ellie' due to some obstructive programming in your new robot body. Will Sam find a way to return to their original human body, or will they be spending the rest of eternity as a glorified appliance?<br/><br/>Features<br/><ul><li>A Life-Sim/Visual Novel/RPG hybrid!<br/></li><li>Voiced Combat Sections starring professional Australian voice actors, including Aimee Smith (Freedom Planet and Smite), Rhiannon Moushall (Age of Darkness: Final Stand and CrisTales) and Allanah Fitzgerald (Kiss Off and Crush Crush)<br/></li><li>A massive full length story following S.E.R.A.'s adventures in The Frakk that bridges the gap between Max's Big Bust - A Captain Nekorai Tale and Alluna and Brie.<br/></li><li>Dozens of unique enemies across multiple varied biomes.<br/></li><li>Explore The Frakk, which features multiple unique islands with their own shops, activities and battle maps<br/></li><li>Gorgeous character art.
