With hundreds of attachments to choose from, each class has many different possible loadouts.<br/><br/>Traverse the galaxy one system at a time - each step of the way you will face unique story events, each of which has multiple outcomes that can change with each playthrough.  Choose whether or not you enter combat, flee or try to talk your way out of difficult situations - but don't think the same choice next time round will have the same outcome!<br/><br/>All set within a beautifully designed universe with an eerily atmospheric soundtrack - Distant Star: Revenant Fleet is a game you'll be playing again and again...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53e7d2ef1f89af9b3659f35a99964cf0.jpg", "website": "http://www.blazinggriffin.com/games/distant-star-revenant-fleet/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 59, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blazing Griffin"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blazing Griffin"], "esrb_rating": null}
