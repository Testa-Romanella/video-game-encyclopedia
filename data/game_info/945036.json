Hunt them down, spray them, and let the soulless GLUG corporation know what&#39;s what.MEET AND GREETThere are three times more NPCs in SLUDGE LIFE 2 than in the original game, which means even more citizens, fellow taggers, corporate stooges, and other assorted oddballs to meet and interact with as you explore a truly weird and wonderful open world.TOOLED UPNew items? We got &#39;em! With the Double Js you can double jump and sprint, while the Portable Launcher lets you throw yourself dramatically into the air. There are more, but we don&#39;t want to spoil the surprise.
