And essentially first time creating a game that is mostly playable &amp; original. Lots that I would like to improve but hey! Its playable now so I'll submit it to compo despite desperately needing music and better UI! <br/> <br/>A top-down shooter revolving around a Movement-form / Fighting-form shapeshift mechanic and a create-more-badguys-to-get-more-points mechanic. <br/> <br/>Currently controller-only! If you aren't on windows AND using an xbox360 pad then you may have to set the controls in the Input tab in the launcher. <br/> <br/>I've now uploaded an updated version that shouldn't violate any of the post-jam-update rules. Basically just ease of life stuff, made the obstacles grey, made sure the controls work properly etc. <br/> <br/>Move with left stick <br/>Press 'X' to place new spawner (points!) <br/>Press 'B' to shapeshift into combat mode (This has a 10 second cooldown, displayed in bottom right)<br/>Shoot with right stick <br/>Press 'start' to reset the level <br/> <br/>Let me know how you do!</p><p>Note: The source project requires use of the PolyNav2D project in unity, which I used for pathfinding. Sorry!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f419ab8c9ea4dfe3b969d84df131ff74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ajhc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
