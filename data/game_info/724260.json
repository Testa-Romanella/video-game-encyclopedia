You are an unnamed little character who is exploring the neighbourhood. You can jump, run, move around dumpsters and use the help of the environment to travel around the area to find key items required for unlocking locked areas. Some places have several ways to get across if any puzzle seems too tricky, yet some obstacles won't be easy to avoid. Just make sure to stay safe from heights, and the locals having a drift party. Lots of secrets to uncover on your journey. Colorful graffiti art in this gloomy neighbourhood will help you find your way to the end of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is entirely free, however, please feel free to share your appreciation if you would like to. I hope you enjoy this interactive experience. Accessibility was the main point, so whatever your computer, you should be able to play it just fine.</p>\n<p>Check out some of my art if you're interested. https://www.instagram.com/iamharis/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b79529d4fd453850f222b2494d39c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iamharis"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
