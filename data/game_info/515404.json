It\u2019s the year 2069, a radioactive element called Radion is now the replacement for electricity where a small chunk of it the size of a green pea is enough to power a building for an entire month. With such powerful resources present, the world must be able to develop much further and people must now be able to live their lives more comfortably, right? But unfortunately that is not the case as these resources have been monopolized by the government and leaving none for the people. Stealing has then become the norm and the only way for survival in this world.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, Radion Heist is then a fast-paced multiplayer parkour game where players would need to work together to bring the Radion safely back to their base. Equipped with a variety of parkour mechanics, players may traverse through the level as freely as they please while having\u00a0 to avoid being caught by the police drones that are constantly after them. With that, the game also features procedurally generated levels to bring a different type of encounter and experience every time the player plays the game.
