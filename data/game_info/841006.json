You can destroy other players by dashing over them. You only can das when any of your\u00a0dash bars are full, bars are filled over time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each disc has three lives, every time you die your disc gains a new dash bar. So each time you die you can perform more consecutive dashes (if more of one bar is full).</p>\n<p>One dashing disc cannot be destroyed, two dashing discs will be repelled.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Move the disc:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard: WASD</li><li>Gamepad (recommended): Left stick.</li></ul>\n<p>Dash:</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard: Space bar</li><li>Gamepad (recommended): A (Xbox layout) / X(Playstation layout)<br/>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:20:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31c7015c7fd4450e9dd5df2721d1791c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EDAM Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
