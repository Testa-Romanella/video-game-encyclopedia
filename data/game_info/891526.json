After every wave you go back to your shelter, and thanks to the ladder that\u00b4s inside, you\u00b4ll get to the basement. There you can buy 2 new weapons, or some Upgrades to your Health and Shields. Then you go back on top and fight more waves of enemies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c90940092304d9326965a2d5319bda9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matyn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
