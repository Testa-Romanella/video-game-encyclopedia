The default controls are visible at the pause menu (escape).</p>\n<p>Utilise each object's gravity in order to scan the planets or the star efficiently.</p>\n<p>Left-click to select target.  Right-click to zoom.  Planets that are far away will be marked by a circle with a line pointing to system north.  The planets don't move but are spawned in random locations around their orbits at the start of each game.</p>\n<p>Pressing 'M' brings up a map of the system. \u00a0ASWD controls the camera (left Shift for fast movement), mouse-scroll zooms in and out.\u00a0 Left-click selects/deselects objects.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a Tips screen accessible from the title screen and from the pause menu.</p>\n<p>We recommend using the highest resolution setting so everything is spaced correctly.  It's a pretty low-demand game so it should still run smoothly.<br/></p>\n<p>This game can be very difficult to get to grips with, so any and all questions are welcome. =)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54bc2d3d2b54151392d79716bd57232e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bitGlass Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
