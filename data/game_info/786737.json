It is based off the popular game Nier Automata's End Credits for ending E. The game uses an OAuth token to gain access to a streamer's Twitch chat.<br/><br/>The game authenticates a streamer so they can fight wave after wave of viewers in their Twitch chat. Like Nier's ending, viewers can choose to sacrifice themselves from the greater good and time themselves out for 30 seconds in the streamer's chat.<br/><br/>NOTE: If viewers decide to type the message \"sacrifice\", they can time themselves out for 30 seconds in order to have their username displayed on the screen. Also, if the player dies and respawns, their name could be attached to one of the ships that appear on screen.<br/><br/>For small streamers, I have added an option to play with XQC's chat if you are not a streamer and still want to play or\u00a0may be worried your chat is too small to play<br/><br/>The main game is ~15 minutes long before the ACTUAL credits roll.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>OTK Animation and graphics by Bumblebaum!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f82273cce5589bdd3118cc3a27ac4bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidarthurpaul"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
