Climb the 16 floors of the tower and defeat the many bosses standing in your way!<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>10 years ago, I made a small, fast-paced dungeon-crawler RPG for Windows Phone 7. Of course, the Windows Phone platform is long gone now. It always bothered me that my game was gone with it. So I finally took the time to port it to PC, and while I'm at it, why not improve it a bit?</p>\n<p>Please, keep in mind that despite the improvements it's still a decade-old game made for smartphones. It's not long, complex or deep, the story is minimal and it works best in short bursts. But hopefully it's still fun! ;)<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>For french-speaking people, I wrote a postmortem a few years back: Tower of Ordal, ou la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un RPG (Postmortem)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T08:46:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df0715864da94001cd20f3765430c900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamnoid"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
