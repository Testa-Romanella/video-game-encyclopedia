This\u00a0makes it harder for the robot to follow the orders given to it by its\u00a0owner. One day the master calls CyberWorld and complains about the malfunctioning in the robot's behaviour.\u00a0 The company's answer is that they're going to replace the robot with a more advanced version that always will obey orders without any problems.\u00a0\u00a0The day after, the robot gets\u00a0 picked up by a\u00a0 truck from CyberWorld full of other identical malfunctioning robots. The master shuts off R1142 and it is moved into the truck with all the other robots. The truck drives to the recycling centre and drops of the pile of noncompliant robots.\u00a0R1142 and the others are\u00a0left to be recycled.
