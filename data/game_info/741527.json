The player&#39;s objective is to capture all these treasure chests and exit the castle. This is done by controlling a couple named Troy and Trixie that both have unique skills. Troy is able to push blocks, carry and throw items. However, Trixie is able to jump much higher than Troy. A combination of each skill is required for players to find the treasures.</p>\n<p>The exit can be used on any point during the game but it is considered to be a bad ending to leave without all treasures or if only Trixie or Troy exit on their own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-19T01:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eec3268197732cce9f457361915bcb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Ishisoft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
