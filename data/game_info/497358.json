{"id": 497358, "slug": "foundry", "name": "FOUNDRY", "name_original": "FOUNDRY", "description": "FOUNDRY\r\nFirst Person Factory Building Game\r\n<p>Build a factory within an infinite voxel world. Mine resources, craft machinery and automate your research to progress through the game. Face logistic challenges by planning and building a\u00a0conveyor belt and pipe network. Manage a complex power system and expand your constantly growing production lines. Alone or with friends (cooperative multiplayer).</p>\n\r\nEarly Access\r\n<p>FOUNDRY is currently in Early Access which means you'll get an in-development alpha build and all future releases of the game until and including the full and final release. \"Providing alpha builds\" for us means that we grant you access to builds where the final scope (in terms of content) is not yet done, we place a heavy focus on fixing bugs and crashes first so that the game is always playable. \"Foundry\" is - especially in single player mode - already very stable and has a solid base of content to enjoy the game. It is yet to be determined how long the game will stay in Early Access but we expect one to two years after launch.</p>\n\r\nSingle- /\u00a0Multiplayer\r\n<p>FOUNDRY\u00a0can be played alone or cooperatively with friends. The game does not require an internet connection for single player mode. Multiplayer mode works with internet and local network. There are currently no player limits for multiplayer, but we think it's best played with 2-4 players at the current state and amount of content. General state of multiplayer mode:\u00a0The game can be completed in multiplayer mode but you have to expect a higher amount of bugs than in single player, almost all bugs should be able to be fixed by saving and re-hosting the game, often it's enough for a client to disconnect and re-join.</p>\n\r\nCurrent Amount Of Content\r\n<p>FOUNDRY provides a lot of content already, from dozens of machines to a wide range of research and different mechanics like conveyor belts, pipes, energy management and more. It\u00a0contains about 15-25 hours of playtime on your first playthrough, depending on your play style and pacing. When playing in multiplayer you can expect to complete the game faster depending on the number of players. There is even\u00a0an endless-mechanic where you can continue to play the game and further expand your factory after you completed every research.</p>\n\r\nJoin the FOUNDRY Community:\r\n\n<p><strong>Dev Blog:</strong> Check out our dev blog where we\u00a0write a weekly recap to keep you up to date on what is going on.</p>\n<p><strong>Any questions left?</strong> Visit our FAQ\u00a0(includes system requirements) or post on the itch.io integrated board.</p>\n<p><strong>Note for content creators:</strong>\u00a0You may create any sort of content you like, you are also allowed to monetize the created content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:31:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3d2bb5a139ce4d6f3adb25bed7ae66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MEDER Dynamics"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
