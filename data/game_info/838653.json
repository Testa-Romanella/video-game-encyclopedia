Your objective is to take out as many of them as you can before the inevitable happens. Your limbs are important since they're what gives you your abilities (e.g. extra movement speed, melee damage, etc.). If a limb is completely destroyed, you will lose the perks that come along with that limb. You can purchase a new limb from one of the 4 consoles spread around the map (each console sells a certain limb type). You can gain credits by killing enemies, but keep in mind that with every purchase, the price for a new limb of that specific type will increase, so buy sparingly.</p>\n<p>Good luck :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Hold LMB to shoot with gun</p>\n<p>Press RMB to swipe sword</p>\n<p>Left Shift to dash</p>\n<p>[E] to interact with the limb vendor consoles</p>\n<p>Escape to pause/resume the game</p>\n<p>Aim your gun/sword with the mouse pointer</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Blood_Jackal23: Programming, UI design, SFX design</p>\n<p>KFM: Soundtrack</p><p>Special thanks to Mr Scientist for helping out with feedback and task management</p>\n<p>pixeldudesmaker:\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/pixeldudesmaker\u00a0(Used for character sprites)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/200ed3a16d5326c5e5d5b62792b0449f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blood_Jackal23"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
