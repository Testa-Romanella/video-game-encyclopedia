In its world, to live a life of monotony and mediocrity was worse than death, so you\u00a0salvage for yourself the beginnings of respect, and, somehow, find yourself in a guard's uniform.</p>\n<p>The game is meant to stir up intense feelings common among the isolated populations, and to deal with them, either to face it, or to make peace with it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T11:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/2863d21508f1ebd16b96cd90c8f035ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["3randon000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
