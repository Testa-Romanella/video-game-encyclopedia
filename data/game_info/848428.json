I suck at drawing and 3D modelling so I\u00a0am making a Text Adventure RPG. I\u00a0just started learning C# so I\u00a0have no idea how to do networking and therefore my first game will be single player.</p>\n<p>I am 41 years old and grew up during the age of Text RPGs and MUDs. I plan to make a game like those yet incorporate modern day ideas such as procedural generation. I want my game to be a different experience every time a new game is started.</p>\n<p>I also want the world to evolve and grow on its own around the player as well as have near infinite progression.</p>\n<p>Eventually when it is complete or near complete I\u00a0will switch it from WEBGL to downloadable so that games can be saved, etc. It is currently only up here as WEBGL to show you\u00a0 my progress as I go.</p>\n<p>Current Features:</p>\n<p>I just started this project so currently all you can do is walk around and look at stuff. I spent a lot of time on the procedural generation script and the minimap. Since the world is generated on the fly I\u00a0needed the minimap to be able to update itself on the fly as well.</p>\n<p>So far it generates the Central District of the starting town and places down a Town Hall building in the center of it. The layout should be different every time the game is started.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T21:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e6045e22cd1ccc7cadc06fec69cff8b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RGreen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
