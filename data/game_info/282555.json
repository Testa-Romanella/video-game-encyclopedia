It was also nominated to be presented at the NYU Game Center\u2019s End of Year Show. The main mechanic is Rewind, where by holding E for varying lengths in time, all objects with the exception of the player will go back to exactly where they were before. This was a solo project, and so while the art isn\u2019t exceptional, I\u2019m happy with the core mechanic and hope to one day flesh it out much more. <br/><br/>Use WASD to move and hold E to rewind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b64/b644fddb7eae170372ec040f54351b0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rialc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
