The game was made for a 2-3 month game jam which was\u00a0focused on graphics with the topics</p>\n<ul><li>Indirection; You cannot attack the boss directly</li><li>Volatility; In certain areas you get hacked, slightly changing your control over the robot</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Minds can be transferred into machines.\u00a0Our enemy has taken control over a space-stationesque satellite\u00a0and is currently trying to boot up the doomsday-laser.\u00a0Of the two robots up there is one with a weak security protocol,\u00a0we hacked it and uploaded your mind.<br/>Please be aware that the enemy has areas with nanomachines that can hack your emotion processor, who knows to what result...

We had to write our own engines in C++ using OpenGL, trying to implement as many (nice looking) features\u00a0as possible. The main ones of my implementation are<br/>* async resource loading<br/>* hardware PCF shadows<br/>* area dependent shaders (the nanomachine areas)<br/>* interpolated skeleton animation<br/>* 3D sound<br/>* PBR &amp; GGX shader with cubemap reflections<br/>* deferred shading<br/>* SSAA &amp; FXAA<br/>* instanced rendering<br/>* selective depth-prepass</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12cc7038c57d23eb2d897b0210e7e701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lamelizard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
