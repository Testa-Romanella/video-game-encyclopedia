Every action takes insane amounts of energy, the battles are never fair, and the struggle just doesn't end. You are descending, and you are lost\".</em></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>: the battle is already lost, and this is where we start. You are in shambles, an easy target for the predators to hunt down and tear apart, and there is not much you can do about it other than flee.<br/></p>\n<p>You are not completely defenseless, but fighting just doesn't seem worth it. Avoidance works best, and it's not a sign of weakness. This is just how you keep yourself alive until you get to safety and recuperate. Whatever happens, don't stop.</p>\n<p>***<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Escape</strong>\u00a0the battlefield that almost crushed you.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong>\u00a0engaging with the enemy at all costs.</li><li><strong>Delve</strong>\u00a0deeper into the nebulous abyss.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Persevere</strong>\u00a0until you no longer can.</li></ul>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: keyboard and mouse.

At least they can be restored, as opposed to your health. But it's alright. You will fail eventually, yes, but until then... please do your best.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0Yanrishatum.
