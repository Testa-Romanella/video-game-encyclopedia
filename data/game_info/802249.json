Maybe is not fun or playable at all. Things like ladders don't exists. A stone have 6 liberties. The game is a bit extrange to play. But in some way os beautiful to see the stones in 3D. Is possible that some rules need to be added or removed. And maybe 5x5x5 is too big and is better to use other sizes. If you try this, tell me you impressions and the things you would like to add. <br/></p><p>Also, if you like this project, consider a donation to speed up the development.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T12:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34b6bd875a928efe1fc350e07e9d48b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jorge"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
