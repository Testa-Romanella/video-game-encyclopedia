As part of this limited time test, the Alpha is available for FREE! <br/><br/>Any and all feedback gathered during this Alpha will help make our release on Steam that much better! Thank you for your support and feedback! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Rushdown Revolt is the most electric, combo-centric and expressive fighting game ever made. Master eight unique characters to team up to take back what's yours or squash The Revolt! Rushdown Revolt supports up to 6 players online (up to 4 players locally) with Vortex Rollback Netcode for a flawless online experience!<br/><br/>Rushdown Revolt  explores making it FUN for you to introduce uninitiated friends into the fighting game genre.  Until now, the most common way to learn fighting games was to get your @$$-whooped. Rushdown Revolt's Tag Team and Gauntlet modes explores an exhilarating and collaborative experience for hardcore and new fighting game players to enjoy this beautiful genre together. <br/> <br/><strong>Core Mechanics</strong><br/>We've spent the last few years focused on making the most electric, combo-centric and expressive fighting game we can imagine.  <br/>Sparks are the defining mechanic of Rushdown Revolt. It's embedded into every attack and move in the game and - once understood - Sparks will push you faster and further than you've ever gone in a fighting game before. <br/><br/>At odds with their skill potential, Sparks are as natural to harness as dribbling a Basketball or Soccer ball (once you've gotten a bit of practice of course).  At the earliest levels of play, even modest use of Sparks will dramatically improve your speed and skill in Rushdown Revolt.  <br/><br/>Sparks directly support our primary goal for Rushdown Revolt's 1v1 gameplay: to create a skill ceiling so high and with so much potential for expression that Revolt will never cease to push our players to increasingly-inspiring feats of skill. <br/><br/><br/>Gauntlets turn our core 1v1 gameplay into a never-ending round robin hangout where you can come and go as you please. Gauntlets are the go-to destination for players to congregate online whether you're hosting a custom lobby or hitting quick play from the start screen.   Each player rotates through a never-ending cycle of players to defeat the reigning Ruler of the Gauntlet. <br/><br/>Armed with only one life, you'll have to give it your best shot. The Ruler, meanwhile, never replenishes their health after each successive victory until they are usurped.  No matter how skilled you are, as Ruler you will eventually be taken out by the never-end hoard of Revolters. <br/> <br/><br/>Tag Team pits a team of Revolters and Rulers into a 2v2 or 3v3 Tag-Battle. Each player on each team rotates through several lives. While your team is rotating through another team member, all \"non-active\" Assisters have access to their Characters' Four Special Abilities in order to directly contribute to the battle.<br/>After you're knocked out for the first time, you'll be armed with a PowerPlay!<br/><br/>Even though you will have more lives coming, you will unlock a new ability. Think of this as your \"Ultimate\" attack: You will jump into the action and have full control of your character to set up any number of exhilarating team combos with your active team member. <br/><br/> <br/>West Coast to Europe? No problem. Vortex Rollback supports controller-to-screen time of a blistering 2 frames with no additional delay necessary up to 150ms latency. *<br/><br/>Vortex Rollback been in development for four years to fully embed it into every aspect of our game engine in order to minimize delay and rollback impacts.  Additionally, Vortex Rollback supports Dynamic Save States so not just 2 Players - but up to Six Players - can come and go in our Gauntlet-style play. <br/><br/>(*) Note: We will not be responsible for your reckless decision to rely on McDoofus's Wifi or a Mobile Hotspot for your online play. Friends don't let friends do WiFi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each character comes with their own set of special skills to dispatch the enemy. Choose your character - and your side of The Revolt - wisely.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fef5eea040352e56a44396659ad3d24.jpg", "website": "http://www.RushdownRevolt.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vortex Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vortex Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
