Controls are ingame.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Its been 5 years since the last robot uprising... Humans and robots have been separated ever since. Some robots, and the ones that didn't become sentient and evil, decided to stay with humans. But something happened. Something happened to\u00a0<em>you</em>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A group\u00a0robots have attacked a sky base near some molten terrain,\u00a0<em>your</em> base. They have eliminated all of your team, but they don't\u00a0know you're still alive. Its now up to you to stop them and take back control of the base. Will you win? Will you die? Will you end up as a servant for those menacing\u00a0robots? Who knows? All that is important is taking out those robots...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Want sneak peeks of the game, and possibly some behind-the-scenes coding?
