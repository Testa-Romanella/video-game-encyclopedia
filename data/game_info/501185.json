The Joy bar at the top will deplete over time, and when cancelling projects (by clicking the red x). Joy is filled when you do some dev work on a project.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Controls:<br/>Mouse - interact, click buttons and drag panels about<br/>Esc - pause</li></ul>\n<p>This is a bit of a personal project for me, as it describes a state I find myself in consistently. I struggle with larger projects, eventually ending up hating them and abandoning them. I have also struggled with Game Jams in the past, my entry for GMTK Jam 2020 was broken and unfinished. So I set a goal to make a super small game, and try to complete it - not desperately hammer it in at 1-minute to deadline - and as I write this, there are 3h 27m to deadline. I'm very happy about that. I spent more time than usual polishing, and although I didn't really get very far with the audio I'm pleased over all.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for playing my game, and I hope you can take something away from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:15:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538925e36387efb03dd9481d22c72e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Haustgeirr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
