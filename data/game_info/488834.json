I released this game several years ago, but I never released it on a website like this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The story is about a girl named Rin who can see ghosts. Rin doesn't have a lot of friends thanks to this secret, but all of that changes when she overhears two other students talking about the 'Paranormal Investigators Club'. They even mention the only member, Yuri, as being able to see ghosts! Rin decides to check out the club and learns that Yuri can indeed see ghosts, but also has the ability to fight them!</p>\n<p>As the game continues Rin and Yuri will battle ghosts in many different areas! This game is split into several different chapters as well! Also the first chapter allows the player to pick where you want to go and depending on your choice, you may learn something new about the school!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Admittedly this game is rough. The music I used is from the 'RPG MAKER VX ACE' program itself. The backgrounds and models are from 'Comipo' as well. The chapters aren't as long and involved as I wanted them to be, but this is a complete game!</p>\n<p>Someday I would love to remake this game into something I can truly be satisfied with!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T05:48:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ffac8d3608f11a0f76f02c03de185f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JordanRayLittle"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
