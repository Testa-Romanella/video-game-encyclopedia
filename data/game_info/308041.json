With the deadline closing in and only a vague idea that you will be researching something about classical music, you attend the concert of the up-and-coming cellist Alan Dalencout to survey the scene. You never expected to find yourself pulled into a group with Alan, his brothers, and two of his friends!</p>\n\r\nThe Dalencourts\r\n\n\n<p>These five men are wealthy, but it\u2019s not their money you find enticing. Try to unravel the mysteries of their hearts!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Olivier Dalencourt</strong></p>\n<p><em>Olivier is incredibly capable and has a warm, \u201cbig brother\u201d vibe. He shows incredible care to his younger brother and seems genuinely concerned about his wayward older brother. Overall he seems outwardly flawless, with a combination of business capability and unmatched consideration for others.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lance Dalencourt</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Lance carries himself as though he is a prince. He has never worked a day in his life, which is immediately evident in his attitude. He interacts with the world as though everyone has an obligation to cater to his every need. Sometimes, however, he will erupt in bursts of anger when prodded about his family.<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alan Dalencourt</strong></p>\n<p><em>Alan is gentle and soft-spoken. He has a tendency to trust people, and this hasn\u2019t become a problem due to Olivier\u2019s protection. His passions can be riled when talking about music, especially the cello, but otherwise, he has difficulties with interpersonal communication.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Vincent Fontaine</strong></p>\n<p><em>Vincent is charismatic and charming; just as talented at pitching his products as he is at innovating new ones. At first glance, he is open and friendly, but he never shows any vulnerability.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Evan Blackwood</strong></p>\n<p><em>Evan feels bored at work. He is a successful investor, but he is so compartmentalized between his work and his emotions that he takes no joy in success. He spends most of his personal time in his apartment, spending all his emotions on raising plants. He feels quite fulfilled with his current arrangement and is rather unwilling to let any more variables into his life.</em></p>\n\n<p>Otome Game by MB Studios</p>\n<p>Note: This is a demo of the full game!
