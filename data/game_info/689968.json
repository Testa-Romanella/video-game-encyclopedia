It is set in a black and white world, a world without colour. But it never used to be this way! Colour radiated free once, before The Colour Thief Cult took it all away.</p>\n\n<p>You play as a colourless, shapeless entity navigating this world, finding, collecting and morphing yourself into the three primary shapes, a triangular prism, a sphere and a cube. Each of which contain colours that you will absorb in order to return them to the world.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Since the arrival of the hunters, it has proven difficult to do so. So you will need to sneak past the hunters and steal your colours back.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T09:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a5d3c9c60df7246d69b2dcd9d46d08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MemoryGhost"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
