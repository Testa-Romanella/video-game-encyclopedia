We kept the scope to 1 player and 1 scene, where the plants that grow have different values and some plants can lose you points if they remain unharvested and \"spoil\".<br/><br/>We as a team did explore more options to try expand the timing system and add a system where the 1 bit colour logic could be Changing\u00a0based on seasons or events. As well as planting the seeds and interacting with the soil. One example would be the ability to grow fruit\u00a0trees as that would happen over time before you could reap the fruit.</p>\n<p>Source code link -\u00a0https://github.com/murock/mid_summer_flame_jam</p>\n\n<p>Open source licences for audio</p>\n<p><strong>Spring Garden by Free Music | https://soundcloud.com/fm_freemusic</strong></p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</p>\n</strong>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</strong></p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.xn--com-5o0a/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T09:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/601a957a8ed810519bff3a131c4b2e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["murock", "Memeseco", "kinokun"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
