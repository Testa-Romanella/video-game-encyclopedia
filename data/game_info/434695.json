I've done a few Ludum Dares in the past (#42 and #43), but then sat out the next few for different reasons, so this one was a fun way of getting back into it. All graphics were made using Inkscape over the course of the weekend, and the music and sound effects were CC0 from OpenGameArt (see the in-game credits screen for details). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/1003a74f47bb947e98f26f7ad490123a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["devharts"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
