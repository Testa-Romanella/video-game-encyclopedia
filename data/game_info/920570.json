The player controls a character with gravity-defying boots, allowing them to switch gravity and walk on roofs to avoid detection and reach flag pieces in hard-to-reach places. The game requires careful planning and quick reflexes to outwit the guards and cameras, with a single mistake leading to failure and starting the level over again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T15:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fc/6fc6aa428152374be13af41127309585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.jaramillor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
