This was my first game jam, I hope you enjoy, and please leave any feedback you may have in the comments!</p>\n<p>When faced with a treacherous thunderstorm,\u00a0Sprout is forced to leave his home behind and flee from a forest fire. To do so, he will have to use his Roots\u00a0to drain powerful Nutrients from the ground, which will help him overcome obstacles. But as the fire grows, he will have to think fast, and use only the correct amounts and types of Nutrients to escape.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D or Left and Right Arrow Keys\u00a0 - Move</p>\n<p>W or Up Arrow Key - Jump</p>\n<p>Spacebar (while above Nutrients) - Root</p>\n<p><em>[Not playable on Mobile.]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>NUTRIENTS:</strong></p>\n<p>Accelerite: Found near patches of Blue grass.
