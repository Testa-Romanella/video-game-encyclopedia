It is separated into three sections to teach different important concepts of anatomy, scoring, and general information about the world's most popular cattle breeds. The Courtyard of Cattle contains an information array about twenty cattle breeds, including 3D models of each breed. The anatomy level includes 3D models for cattle bones, muscles, and digestive organs; in this level, the player can interact with the specific organs, muscles, or bones and get information about the item. The last area is cattle scoring, where the player can learn about how cattle are scored in real life; the two examples we have to present are dairy cattle locomotion scoring and beef body condition scoring.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T03:16:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cff1c557465c63126c559da86574399d.jpg", "website": "https://www.cattle101.com/cattle-101-library", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Hansen Free"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Free Mind Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
