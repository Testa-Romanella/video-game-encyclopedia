No, while the seasons of Equestria being thrown into chaos by the disturbance of the Fourforce by the self-styled scion of darkness and despair\u00a0<em>seems</em> like it may be grounds for some three-part epic... for these girls who have gone through so much already, this is barely worth getting out of bed over.</p>\n<p><em>Out of Season ~Reverie Equestria~</em> is a lighthearted\u00a0RPG\u00a0Maker MV game featuring the protagonists of\u00a0<em>My Little Pony:\u00a0Friendship is Magic</em>. It takes place in the highly-belated\u00a0<em>Reverie Equestria</em> alternate universe, and despite being one of the last stories chronologically, is the first proper <em>RevEq</em> story published.</p>\n<p>Although\u00a0<em>Out of Season</em> will feature pretty much all original assets and custom scripts with novel gameplay compared to other MV games,\u00a0<strong>pretty much none of that is in yet because this game is in very early alpha</strong>. What is already present however is the rich character dialogue and the bonus interactive objects such as naughty background ponies,\u00a0scary mannequins, and invisible wagons.</p>\n<p><strong>Game content</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>This game is\u00a0<strong>SFW</strong> with only very light swearing\u00a0(\"damn\" et al) and no sexual content beyond occasional references to butts and one easter egg.

However, there will be no blood, gore, or explicit depiction of death at any point in the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Availability</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Out of Season</em> is currently\u00a0only available as a Windows executable.</li><li>RPG Maker MV games are HTML5\u00a0and can technically export to MacOSX,\u00a0Linux, Android, and raw web upload.\u00a0However, itch.io has very poor support for a game that is both HTML5 but also downloadable, and I am unable to personally test builds for the other platforms.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T16:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/9566bc0638abab33dcd49f180082d57e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fibs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
