You\u2019ll get to see their childhood, the events that led them to start their paths of adventure, and how they came to learn their skills. You\u2019ll also get to see the moment when they first meet!</p>\n<p>This game will be unique to our series in that you will choose one of two paths to follow: Becca\u2019s or Rosalia\u2019s. That means you\u2019ll need to play the game twice to get the full story, but you\u2019ll essentially get two different games in one!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<p>v0.1.0</p>\n<ul><li>Becca's path introduction completed</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3ed05df6c85db04d7c757411dc69f99c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naomi Carrigan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
