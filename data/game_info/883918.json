That way there can be less enemies on the map.<br/></p>\r\nDetails:\r\n<p>This game was\u00a0made\u00a0for\u00a0Trijam #195 for the theme: \"Cut Your Losses\"</p>\n<p>Every time an enemy touches you, you grow. If you grow too much, you blow up. Your goal is to shrink yourself by touching the shrinkers to cut your losses before your growth gets worse. Good luck!</p>\n<p>(comment your high scores!)</p>\n<p><em>Music Credits: </em><em>https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-music-pack-loopable</em></p>\r\n:D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56acd87d840625a4c7719b8c9a8f9d68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bump"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
