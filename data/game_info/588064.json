She has left her main nest with some followers in order to build an own reign because she doesn't want to be under control of others. In order to guarantee the surviving of her and her followers she needs to get to a new nest asap. That will only work with help of her soldierlike creatures which she is supervising. They are able to connect to each other to create bridges, towers etc. for her to travel through the level. The queen creature on the other hand is only able to walk straight and thus is not big of a help to overcome the boundaries. Unfortunately, only a limited number of soldiers are following her  and sometimes she even has to sacrifice one in order to move further.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:41:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a9069cd8b6d1a18223c1640d18f65a6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bobafettus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
