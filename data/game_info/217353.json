If you can\u2019t name three members of NSYNC, this might not be your jam.<br/><br/>Earn gems by watching short ads and answering questions correctly (even if you're out of the running for cash).<br/><br/>Then, trade those gems for special features like power-ups, extra lives &amp; take aways. <br/><br/>Let's Get Social<br/><br/>Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/popculturelive)<br/>Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/popculturelive)<br/>Twitter (https://twitter.com/popculturelive)<br/>Snapchat (https://www.snapchat.com/add/popculturelive)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/475/47561dae1a8eef16585d90364bfeebff.jpg", "website": "http://popculturelive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Treehouse Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Treehouse Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
