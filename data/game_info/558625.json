The ascension to the top floor of The Tower - the Sacred Room - is full of dangers and spirits of the dead; enemies of the Goddess that must be purged.</p>\n<p>To defend themselves from vengeful spirits of the dead, each of the servants of the Goddess can perform <strong>purifying rites</strong>, using their magic candles.
