It is in active development, and only two chapters are out so far. The game was inspired by\u00a0<em>Sky: Children of the Light,\u00a0</em>and is very much lore-based. Not much story in the first chapter though. Story is told through cutscenes and by talking to NPCs. Explore the world before you run out of power! Use ENTER to progress through menus and cutscenes. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>New chapters will be coming soon, progressing the story. The story will span a long time. I may even create separate books, each containing 2-5 chapters, and each at a different time period. Anyways, enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaa/eaab7758205e4359b5c6018ae81c892f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Future Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
