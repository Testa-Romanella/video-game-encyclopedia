However, no one has attempted until now. Keep accelerating, and avoid the fleets of drones that will try to take you down! The Tachyon's main weapon is the time blaster, which can be fired so quickly that those firing seem to be able to maneuver as if the world slowed down around them!</p>\n<p>Made by Jonas Clermont\u00a0for the Extra Credits Game Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47f164d729c635e7e35df11f6960fee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jclermont"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
