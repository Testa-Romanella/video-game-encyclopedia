I knew very little about RTS development,\u00a0AI programming, spell casting, vfx for spells, resource transformation and processing (crafting system), have the environment react to your spells (systemic).</em></p>\n<p><em>I tried to tie all of these elements together after that I started to get bored of the game\u00a0and decided I wanted to polish it to a state it was playable and presentable. Everytime I found something interesting to learn, I added it as long as it didn't break the game to much.</em></p>\n<p><em>Things I didn't focus on (as I didn't spend so much time on): UX, Game Balancing (a little bit), animation, 3D modeling (a little bit), UI, Art, lighting &amp; sound (a litttle bit)</em></p>\n\r\nUndying Buddies\r\n\r\nRTS game where you incarnate a demon, manage a production like to generate energy, buy spells and annihilate a town before they get to you\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>You goal is to destroy the village, for this use the environment or combine your spells to kill the villagers. Once a villager is attacked, the entire village will run toward you. So be prepared!</p>\n<p>- Your demons can't defend themselfs, you have to use them to transform the local resources into energy. Add more demon pit &amp; recruit more demons to process faster. Right click on the souls in the demon pit to turn them into energy.</p>\n<p>- Energy can then be used to unlock spells, up to 4 spells out of the 6 the game proposes at the moment.</p>\n<p>- Systemic spells system; if you use a spell on an other, they get affected, a poison patch, will explode if it collides with fire, dealing all the poison damage at once and explosion damage. Every spell can be combined with an other!</p>\r\nKeyboard Controls\r\n<p><strong>Move \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0</strong>Arrow Keys / ZQSD\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Turn souls/resource into energy\u00a0\u2014</strong>\u00a0Right Click</p>\n<p><strong>Move resources/demon around \u2014</strong> Left Click on them</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong><strong>\u00a0\u2014</strong>\u00a0Brings you back to your first demon pit</p>\n<p><strong>Escape\u00a0\u2014 </strong>Menu</p>\n\n<p><em>(Left click to open the processing menu, press dropdown to select an input, if combination of inputs is correct, it'll show the output at the bottom, hit apply to set this demon pit to produce this resource)</em></p>\n\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>Antoine Fauville</p>\n<p>Asset used:\u00a0Polygon Viking, Polygon Knights, CryptUI</p>\n<p>Music: Free of use music from\u00a0Kevin MacLeod on Youtube by Creative Commons Attribution</p>\n\n<p>Issue known:</p>\n<ul><li>Game Time buttons not working</li><li>Spam click the demon pit can cause the button not to work anymore -&gt; make sure turn on &amp; off the creation mode of demon pit each time</li><li>Escape doesn't work in some instances -&gt; use the close button</li><li>Some enemies can go behind trees &amp; can't be seen -&gt; look at the live of your demon pit, check if it's going down</li><li>Demon pit processsing interface not clear as it's inputs &amp; not outputs</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:27:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68e0dde233aea634bfb9416cb43b965e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antoine Fauville"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
