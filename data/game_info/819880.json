This game is sadly kind of scuffed since the build that my programmer uploaded wasn't working and he wasn't available to fix it. So I had to remake the entire game within just 5 hours. Sorry for the quality, it's the best I managed to do in the time I had. \r\n\n\r\n\r\nDiceworld: Immortal is the hot new action adventure, metroidvania, platformer by the creator who brought you smash hits like: Icon.png, apex (not legends), and the one in which you play a clump of flesh. \r\n<p>The concept is simple:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. get coins by hitting your head on floating, golden dice. <br/></p>\n<p>1,5. (optional) Use the in game shop to buy more coins to get to the rewards quicker and save time. <br/></p>\n<p>2. open lootbo... I mean *surprise mechanics* to obtain random gifts. <br/></p>\n<p>3. explore the world to find the end goal and finish the game.</p>\n\n\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>A and D: Movement</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n\n\n\r\n#stuff#:\r\n- lootbox drop chance is not actually random - the in game shop is needed to progress if you don't want to grind for hours - all our employees are underpaid and slept in the office for the last two months of development because the crunch was real - some of our employees breast milk was stolen, so they weren't able come to work and had to get laid off - this whole thing is not a joke or parody.. absolutely not -", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794d4ee8dfdb5db35efb8a46f99b1e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Grieshofer", "Millimedia Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
