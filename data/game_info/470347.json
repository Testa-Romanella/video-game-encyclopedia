Initial idea was to abduct cows, and dodge maybe bullets from men in black sorta agents\u00a0 in tiny worlds. but I got thinking and thought of a deeper approach</p>\n<p>So the idea is basically archaic aliens that help the building of earth. This involved a lot more research than I thought. So I had to search theories of\u00a0\u00a0how actually it began and stuff . So this is a journey from\u00a0 the beginning of earth.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cow abductions and men in black\u00a0 might be a bit enjoyable now that I think about it. Maybe this can be fun for some folks too</p>\n<p>Emjoy. and please do provide feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I haven't checked out the mac and linux versions. do let me know if it works as it should.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:47:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc309dadf83c798827b0ab7a1b857972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["baan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
