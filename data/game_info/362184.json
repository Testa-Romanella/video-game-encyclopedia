However, you can opt to play in\u00a0<strong>Amputee Mode</strong>, which lets you progress through the game with just one hand. Perfect if you're missing a hand, sipping a beer, or holding a baby.<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>This game uses a special control scheme that requires an Xbox-style (X-input) gamepad with two joysticks. It cannot be played with a keyboard and mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d0/6d0e08054c4f136cbd37978f5ab93649.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pabischoff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
