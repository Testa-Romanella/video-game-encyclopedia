{"id": 575118, "slug": "winter-ware-demo", "name": "Winter Ware Demo", "name_original": "Winter Ware Demo", "description": "<p>I would like to present to you all one of my latest projects that I\u2019ve been working on ever since December.</p>\n<p>It is essentially a collection of 10 unique\u00a0winter-inspired micro-games included in one large package, which gradually becomes more difficult as your score increases. Titles such as the \"Warioware\" games were a huge inspiration.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Originally this game was supposed to be released\u00a0late 2020, but due to time restrain and several other complications, I kept on delaying it (also because I wanted to polish it as much as possible before releasing a public build)\r\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a proficient programmer, so I had to learn some new tips and tricks. Plus creating a video game with easy accessibility on the front-hand is no easy task!\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway here's just a small glimpse of it and I do hope that you all had a fabulous winter break! Also, be sure to post your high-scores!</p>\n<p>PS: I do realize that Winter has already ended, but hey! Better late than never!</p>\n\n<p>For the best possible experience (and bug-free) be sure to download either the Windows or Linux version as those are the platforms the game is intended to be played on! \r\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve already noticed that when playing on the web browser the game audio doesn\u2019t speed up.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- Are you planning on further developing it? -\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Well at the moment I have loads\u00a0of other projects I would absolutely love to work on, that being said who knows, I might include it as part of a larger-scale project or possibly finish it for next winter.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>- What programs did you use? -\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Well, to stick everything together I used Unity, as for art a combination of \u201cPhotopea\u201d and \u201cInkscape\u201d, and finally for sound editing \u201cAudacity\u201d.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>- Why does it feature only\u00a0single input games? -\r\n</p>\n<p><em>My main goal and challenge for this project were to create a serial of fun micro-games that can be all completed with a single input. To achieve this, I had to make sure that the overall experience is easily\u00a0accessible. This includes the use of\u00a0distinguishable colours, large icons, and helpful bright visuals\u00a0with clear audio cues.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Music -\u00a0Tim Beek\r\n</p>\n<p>SFX -\u00a0Freesound.org\u00a0|\u00a0OpenGameArt\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional Sprites -\u00a0OpenGameArt\u00a0|\u00a0pzUH</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab6fd59841c75d159257833335c4636.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Fulv90"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
