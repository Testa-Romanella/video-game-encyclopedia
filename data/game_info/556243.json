They've already started.<br/><br/>Become the Doge Master.<br/><br/>BE AWARE - The dogecoins in this app are FAKE, and therefore cannot be redeemed, spent, or used in the real world. There are no connections to the real virtual currency, Doge Coin. This game does not, and never will, have the ability to generate, or \"mine\", real virtual currency. In this app, the terms \"mine\", \"mining\", or \"mined\" refer to the process of obtaining dogecoins from rocks.<br/><br/>Note: Doge Miner is free to play but does offer in-app purchases for various kinds of things. Any dogecoins acquired through in-app purchases will only work within the app itself and cannot be redeemed, spent, or used in the real world. You can disable in-app purchases in your iOS system settings.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T04:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17a3af50b5d169741d7d6ae85985621b_VuypINc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Albert Kornas"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Albert Kornas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
