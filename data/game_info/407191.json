Please don't hesitate to post if you're experiencing problems with MindCore, we'll try and get back to you as quickly as possible. You can also mail us directly at info@maxcare.app<br/>Here's a quick summary of things you can do if you encounter problems with the game:</p>\n<ul><li>Restart Browser. It's so obvious that sometimes we forget it too, but in some cases it fixes weird one-time issues.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Make sure your drivers are updated. Especially graphics drivers can cause problems if they're out of date.</li></ul>\n<p>If none of the above helped, please get in touch and we'll try to work it out with you! You can help us by\u00a0including the \"Player.log\" file\u00a0which can be found in the MindCore directory (described above) and the\u00a0crashlog-file\u00a0which should be in the same directory after the game crashes.<br/><br/>Thank you all for your support and for being patient with us, we're working really hard to get the game working for everyone! :)<br/>Cheers,<br/></p>\n<p>AH Studio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c6fddd7053fdfa768e176de8af5bdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElPrinz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
