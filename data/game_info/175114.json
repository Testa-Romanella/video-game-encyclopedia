Well, at least before the monsters. And the ghosts.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>However, don't worry -our beloved king has come to save everybody! The problem is that the king is <em>also </em>a ghost. With only one hand, and one sword, you have to reach the end of the levels and battle the evil bosses.</p>\n<p>Nameless Kingdom is a platformer/action game where your skill with the sword and is important. Enemies are strong, but you still have a chance.</p>\n<p>This is the first game we do as a team. Also is the first game we do with the marvelous Godot Engine. Hope you like the game!</p>\n<p>You can play in the browser (tested with Firefox 57) or download a Windows installer for the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: use cursors to move and jump. Press A to attack. Sword can be controlled with up/down arrows.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Little disclaimer:</strong> unfortunately, we have discovered a number of relatively important bugs in this version of the game. <strong>We cannot change it for the moment, in order to respect Gameoff's jam rules. </strong>However, the development continues! Everything will be updated after the voting ends. We expect to have a fully-playable game then! Thank you for understanding.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/8843ea68c5aee0a353d19e0a9150f466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VictorSeven7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
