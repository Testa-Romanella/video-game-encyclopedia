Based on initial feedback we have unfortunately decided to can the project and move in a different direction.</p>\n<p>There are a couple systems included that haven't been fully fleshed out, such as the [tab] map menu. Feel free to experiment with the 3 extra Skills points!</p>\n<p>If you get stuck, don't forget to look closely behind trees and across the water!\u00a0The Prototype is over upon reaching the Victory screen.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>w,a,s,d - move<br/>space - attack<br/>left shift - dash<br/>q, e - abilities<br/>tab - open the map menu<br/>esc - exit fullscreen, esc again to open pause menu</p>\n<p>All Scripts, Art, and Music are original creations by ParrTay. Other than using the Unity game engine, it was quite fun trying to make this game from scratch!</p>\n<p>The Bonus is a boss we created for a previous iteration of this game. It is quite difficult!\u00a0I would be thoroughly impressed if you managed to find all 5 pieces of bread without dying, as the boss keeps coming back.</p>\n<p>*This game was built to be played on a 1080p monitor, and is fixed to the 16:9 aspect ratio. I recommend hitting the full screen button in the lower right corner. Press esc to exit full screen and esc again to open the pause menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T04:58:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27ccd0ac134c701830e194d334e12088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ParrTay Gaming"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
