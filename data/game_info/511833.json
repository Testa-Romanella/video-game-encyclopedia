Just shuffle the runes, close your eyes (or not\u00a0), ask your question and choose three random or favorite runes. And they will tell you everything! It doesn't matter if you are serious about fortune-telling or not.\u00a0Because it's also a good way to have fun with friends or just relax after a hard day's work to the sound of falling runes. All the sounds are recorded from real runes.</p>\n<p>A version for android will be soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the help:<br/>2D artist: Irina Krivosheeva https://www.artstation.com/rittby<br/>Soundtrack composer: Vlad Kostarev kostarewlad@gmail.com\u00a0<br/>Translation: Mosunova Mariia rikanova777@gmail.com\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:21:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ebab35cbd5ad922d39aea732cb8204.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DoubleVGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
