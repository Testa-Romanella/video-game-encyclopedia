Face your destiny!</p>\n\n<p>Z to attack. Arrow keys move. Double tap an arrow key to dash. Press x to restart if you die.</p>\n\n<p>The restart feature is super wonky and doesn\u2019t reset the map tiles, so if you want a full board again, you\u2019ll have to reboot the game. Also, the dash move is on a cool down timer that I didn\u2019t get to tune as much as I would have liked and I didn\u2019t get a chance to put in an indicator for it. I think it\u2019s about a 1 second gap between dashes<br/></p>\n<p>Made with PICO-8 at the RVA Game Jams (https://rvagamejams.com/) Ludum Dare 42 event. This is my first full, complete game I\u2019ve made by myself. Hope you like it.</p>\n\n<p>PICO-8:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php</p>\n\n<p>Talk to me:\u00a0</p>\n<p>YouTube: www.youtube.com/schmielshow\u00a0</p>\n<p>Snapchat: eschmiel\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/eric_schmiel/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tumblr:\u00a0http://eschmiel.tumblr.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Neov00\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/eschmiel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/723659cb11f01528962d8ab4c4c6643e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric Schmiel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
