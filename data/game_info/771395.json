Also you can manage your network. The bigger the networks and the longer you keep them alive, the more points you get. But be carefull! A serverfailure will cascade through the network.</p>\n<p>The recommended browser is firefox but if you have any problem you can download the Windows version as described below. The Windows version is much more stable!<br/></p>\n<p>Connecting/Disconnecting servers to/from a network can be a bit strange.
