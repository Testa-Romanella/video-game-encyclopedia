What I mean by that is:</p><ul><li>Bullets are affected by the players' velocity, so even if you can only aim up-down-left-right, by running or jumping you allow yourself more degrees (get it?) of possibilities.</li></ul><ul><li>Whenever a weapon is fired, knock back happens. Use a shotgun for a double jump or a sub machine gun as an impromptu jet-pack.</li></ul><p><strong>the plan</strong></p><p>The idea is to currently focus on local multiplayer game mode(s), and when a solid foundation's been reached, branch out to a more story-driven single player mode.</p><p>The game needs to be fun first right? Plus there's plenty of kinks to figure out along the way.</p><p><strong>what can it currently do?</strong></p><p>At the moment the important features would be:</p><ul><li>2-4 player local multiplayer deathmatch (every player* needs a controller!)</li><li>Configure game settings such as points-until-victory, max HP and other similar variables</li><li>5 weapons to mess around with, one of them with explosions</li><li>4 maps that are pretty much barren testing grounds</li></ul><p>*Player 1 can use a keyboard</p><p>Controls, change log and other miscellaneous stuff is included in the download's enclosed readme.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f4/5f427eb0a2723035e9cb436cc94aaf06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sinis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
