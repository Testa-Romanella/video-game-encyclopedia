Before long you will have a small village that you can visit to prepare for your next dungeon run.</p>\n\n<p>This is Abraham, he retired and opened a Weapon Shop.

Over 100 types of monsters are planed to inhabit the dungeons of Mysteria(the list currently stands at over 40) with many different skills, strengths and weaknesses, some of them more dangerous than others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T07:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/0378da0dc9469155b93f516e4ae480c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grindalf Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
