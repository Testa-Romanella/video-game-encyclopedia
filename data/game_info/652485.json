Feeling inspired, I decided, \"hey, I wanna make a Quake clone in 10 days!\".</p>\r\nELDERJAM\r\n<p>\"ElderJam\" is a working title I gave to the project (I needed to name it something, after all). It's a nod to HP Lovecraft. This game was mostly built solo, in 10 days. It was a fun challenge. Some resources and assets were borrowed during the creation process; see CREDITS.txt for full details.</p>\r\nFUTURE?\r\n<p>Will ElderJam become a full game? I don't know. I'm currently busy working on another actual game (Darkadia, a first person survival horror game running on the GZDoom engine). After Darkadia ships - and if there's enough demand for it - I'd definitely be open to the idea of making ElderJam an actual, complete game.</p>\r\nSUPPORT ME!\r\n<p>If you enjoy ElderJam, and want to further support my game development activities, consider subscribing to my Patreon, or send me a direct donation to Paypal (https://paypal.me/NashMuhandes).</p>\n<p>If you choose to donate to me directly, please also e-mail me at nashmuhandes.gamedev@gmail.com so that I can come up with some kind of special reward for you!</p>\n<p>Also consider pay-what-you-want on the ElderJam OST Bandcamp, or just help spread the word about my creations!
