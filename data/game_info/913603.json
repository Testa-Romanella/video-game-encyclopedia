And the best part? Different coins are worth different amounts, so you have to strategize to get the most valuable coins before time runs out.</p>\n<p>One of the cool things about this game is that you can use the potion power-ups to give yourself an edge and make yourself bigger and faster! Another thing that makes this game so exciting is that it's a short minigame, so you can play it whenever you have a few minutes to spare. It's perfect for when you're waiting in line, or when you're on a break at work.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Start collecting those coins! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T07:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d38b360952650434cd3f63fb3498e194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aryan Tyagi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
