It's called Over the Rainbow, to go along with Colour as the theme for our game jam. Within the hub world, you will find seven doors marked with the 7 colours of the rainbow. Each door will lead through a platforming area to retrieve respectively coloured gem, all required to open the Great Door and reach the end of the rainbow</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>Due to time, was unable to fill the Indigo and Violet doors. As such, the current build only requires Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue for the Great Door, and the remaining two doors are inactive.</p>\n<p>Also, apologies for the upload size. The skybox textures are unfortunately large</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T04:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fbf56beccc41c093d3247f3693b7104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bojarzin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
