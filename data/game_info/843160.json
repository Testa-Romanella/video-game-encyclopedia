BUT\u00a0one can't guide a kangaroo where he wants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So you <strong>jump opportunestly</strong> from one kangaroo to another with a better direction.</p>\n\r\nOnly one control :\r\n<ul><li>&lt;Space&gt; makes you jump to a (random) near kangaroo</li></ul>\n<p><em>Specialist hint: If no kangaroo is at reach, &lt;space&gt; will speed it up</em></p>\r\nDevlog:\r\n<p>This session we are late. Three main causes:</p>\n<ul><li>A stupid bug that took me 45minutes to resolve, because of my inexperience with Godot (after years of Unity)</li><li>A quite optimistic scope.\u00a0 We had to give up several nice features, and some graphics will remain unused. We focused on the most important points, and we could release a playable version</li><li>The gameplay is also uncommon. We were not sure it would work, and could not prototype before. It took quite a lot of time to balance the gameplay. First versions were not funny at all. Now, it's playable.\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>I'm sure we could improve the game\u00a0a lot with a couple of hours, but we chose not to go over the timer anymore.<br/></p>\n<p>(Dev : 3h50 +10min\u00a0 / Graphist: 2h30 / Musician: 2h)</p>\n<p>Edit: finally\u00a0spent 10 more minutes for adding rocks and bushes and for music problem when restarting a game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/196fe2e62ab7b0f713b661fe4f43c034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["psevrain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
