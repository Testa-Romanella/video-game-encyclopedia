Controller input doesn't work, and fullscreen scales weird. Sorry!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a nod of appreciation to both the vaporwave genre, and to the sorts of animated sitcoms that became popular in the 1990s. Specifically, the Simpsons, but it's not the only work referenced here.<br/></p>\n<p>A note about the visual style:\u00a0The game does not follow NES specifications exactly. The resolution is right, and the palette is close, but sprites-per-screen limits are not observed. I made some effort to follow the 3-colors-per-sprite rule, and I used traditional cheating methods when assembling larger pictures out of multiple sprites, but I broke it in a few places.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls (keyboard)\r\n<ul><li>Move with WASD or ARROW KEYS.</li><li>Attack with J or NUMPAD PLUS.
