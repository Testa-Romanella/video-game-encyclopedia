Lovecraft</em> and weird shows like <em>Twin Peaks</em>.</p>\n<p>This is a <strong>preview</strong> version of the game, containing the first chapter (from a total of 10), and the idea of releasing this is to get some feedback and support while we finish the rest of the game, and also most of all to help spreading the word. So if you like this and are interested, please tell someone about it, tweet, post somewhere, we really appreciate it!</p>\n<p><strong>Blackout</strong> is a game about choices, the story will change a lot based on what you choose, there is no illusion of choice, I encourage you to play it a second time to see how much it changes. Items you pick up might change your choices, as well as your 3 attributes: Courage, Sanity and Fitness. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><em><strong>The full version of the game will be paid, this will remain as a demo of sorts.</strong></em></p>\n<p>If you want to get in touch, or know more about the game, you can find me\u00a0@robsonsiebel<br/></p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects made by the amazingly talented Ted Wennerstr\u00f6m (http://tedwennerstrom.com)</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or typos, please send an email to <strong>minichimeragamestudio@gmail.com</strong>, if you can attach a screenshot as well, even better!</p>\n<p>You can also check our Devblog\u00a0or subscribe to the newsletter\u00a0for more in depth information, articles and other games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c1557854c711135e031cec3be955ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MiniChimera"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
