Only yesterday you pulled off a massive heist at the local bank, and ran into the desert to escape the Sheriff's posse. Then the aliens\u00a0found you. Those glowing, pulsing flying aliens beamed up right above you and sent their best drones to get that gold (You see, aliens want nice things too, and well... you did steal it) but never mind! Show those low-down extra terrestrials who owns this land!\u00a0You have dynamite! You have a Gun! Use your desperado skills to\u00a0own the desert!</p>\n\n<p>Use W,A,S,D To move, Left click to Fire, and G to throw grenades</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8e87eec726cb81cd39d55e4640c179f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team_Virus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
