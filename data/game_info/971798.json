He discovers very quickly that the owners, the Italian mafia, makes sure their clients pay them one way or another.<br/><br/><strong>Thankfully for him, the mafia was sent to your house instead!</strong><br/><br/>In this parody of Scott Cawthon's \"Five Nights at Freddy's\", you find yourself trapped inside your conveniently located nuclear fallout bunker, with unwanted visitors rapidly approaching your location. From your bunker, you must stalk the intruders movements until they become a threat, and use the bullet-proof steel doors at your disposal to lock them out. But use these tools conservatively, as you are running off a crappy generator, in need of constant repair, and with very limited gas left. To them, you are a sitting duck, it is up to you to ensure you make it to midnight.<br/><br/>Good Luck!<br/><br/><strong>Made With Godot</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T09:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d29/d29728a2c39cfbc6afafb124a7207533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bartholomeus Mortimis"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Bartholomeus Mortimis"], "esrb_rating": null}
