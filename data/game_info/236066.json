You can also modify the game and play as a couple just so you can see your significant other act out something like \u201ctie me to the bedpost.\u201d<br/><br/>Great when played with 4 or more people as an all-play game where each team can act out or draw the same term at the same time.  For even more laughs feel free to sneak a peek at the other team\u2019s drawing or take a gander at what their actor is doing.  Our favorite rule is \u201cthe less rules, the more fun!\u201d  Whichever team guesses the term first earns a point.  The first team to 10 points wins the game.
