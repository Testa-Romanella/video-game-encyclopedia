Use charged drones to push and pull the capsules back home. This game is based loosely on real life electrostatics.</p>\n<p>Music: \"Step to Space\" by rolemusic</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Place drones using the mouse then press space to begin the simulation. You can use positive and negative charged drones to pull and push the capsule.\u00a0Try to get the blue dot (the escape capsule) to the purple circle (your home-world) without hitting any asteroids or drones.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT TIP: The impact charged drones have on the capsule is heavily influenced by how close they are to it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>'Left Click': Place positively charged drone or add +1 Coulomb of charge to existing drone. Positive drones pull the capsule towards them.</p>\n<p>'Right Click': Place negatively charged drone or add -1 Coulomb of charge\u00a0to\u00a0existing drone. Negative drones push the capsule towards them.</p>\n<p>'Space': Begin Simulation</p>\n<p>'Backspace': Delete last placed drone.</p>\n<p>'H': Helpscreen</p>\n<p>'Esc': Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:30:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe3/fe362067d16019dfbea9518dbc80c6ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fishtail"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
