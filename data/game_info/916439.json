You\u2019re a skeleton\u00a0who is given the duty to track down a big-nosed\u00a0meanie who mutilated and ate your self-esteem\u00a0and encounters various horrible things as the adventure goes on. This game isn\u2019t your average Cooler\u00a0game; its content is comparable to games like YIIK and Deltarune. This game also has the added effect of making you depressed as you played. Counting real games and fan games, this could be one of the most traumatic and horrifying games in the world, and we\u2019re not joking. This is easily one of the most disturbing cool games to come out\u2026well, ever, really.<br/></p>\n<p>I do it for the money.<br/>TL;DR: Eat Crap, Maggot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T16:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ffb37ad0bdaf6e5132d3da88dac9b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Junstuck"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
