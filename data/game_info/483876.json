But along the way, expect to encounter \"inflection points\" that teleport you, redirect you, adjust your speed, or otherwise stop you in your tracks.\u00a0Finishing the entire game will require quick decision-making and a determination to outmaneuver the maze.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a fully-featured Level Editor, allowing you to design your own mazes of varying\u00a0complexity. You can save the levels you create, and also share them with friends or family.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1bbc0efed419b43aa69b6b91ff2c35b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Caleb Evans"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
