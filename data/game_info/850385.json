A fearless warrior who can rewind time, create portals and play a guitar... hey, what if she could also fight giants?</p>\n\r\nSo... what is this?\r\n<p><em>Unity Playground</em> is a study project for experimenting and implementing features requested by the community of NevascaXD's. As the name suggests, the project is made with Unity during the streams and has no scope or GDD.\u00a0It will continue to grow as long as the crazy ideas keep existing.</p>\n\r\nCan I also suggest something?\r\n<p>Of course you can! The more ideias, the more chaotic the project will become. You can go to NevascaXD's channel, save some points and claim the \"Implementar Mec\u00e2nica\" reward (the one with a tools icon) and describe the mechanic you would like to be implemented. Remember to keep it as a single game mechanic, rather than a whole game ideia, so everyone gets the chance to increment the game little by little, maybe even adding up to the one you have asked.</p>\n\r\nWhat comes next?\r\n<p>\u00a0You can check the requests queue on our public Trello page. After that, well.. who knows? We started with some magics and soon we are leaving the planet, we actually have no ideia what comes next.</p>\n\r\nAre the project files public?\r\n<p>Yes! You can go to its public repository on GitHub and check the project for yourself. Be aware that it contains some legacy code and malpractices that will slowly be refactored to use better architecture and conventions, but hopefully you can get some insights on how things were accomplished in the game.</p>\n<p>You can also use the assets for your own personal project, as long as you credit their authors and\u00a0where they were taken from.</p>\n\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>This project came to life thanks to the great community of our Twitch channel, not only for the fun and crazy suggestions, but also for the whole support, help and company throughout all of our many streams.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for being part of this community!</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li><strong>AWSD:</strong> move;</li><li><strong>Space:</strong> jump;</li><li><strong>Tab:</strong> open skill selection;</li><li><strong>Left mouse:</strong> use skill;</li><li><strong>Right mouse:</strong> use skill alternative / aim;</li><li><strong>Esc:</strong> open pause menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f0c46dbcae64bfe3b83283f1436b38d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nixtor Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
