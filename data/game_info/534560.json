I upload the game launcher here, you download it and install the game through it. You can also download the demo version of the game to the place of the launcher, for review, there is no multiplayer and updates in it. Development started 4 months ago and is still stable. Updates are released every month. I want to gather the first audience around the game. I will be grateful to everyone who plays.</p>Singleplayer<p>There is currently no content in single player mode. This is due to the fact that I have been working on game mechanics all this time. Everything will appear soon.</p>Multiplayer<p>The cooperative mode is created in the likeness of the games Rust / CS: GO / GMOD, etc. Gaming sessions support up to 100 simultaneous connections. Servers are created by the players themselves.</p>\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n<p>1 GB RAM</p>\n<p>1 GB ROM</p>\n<p>Intel/AMD processor (2.5 GHz+)</p>\n<p>NVIDIA GT 650/AMD RADEON HD 4770o</p>\n\r\nSocial networks\r\n<p>Website: https://torque.clan.su/</p>\n<p>Instagram: @torque_game</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/pXW93tP</p>\n<p>Email: support@aftergame.ml</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:08:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b35dfa2ff88d0f5379b4f1ede94d142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moonway"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
