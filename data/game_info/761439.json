Six years later, originally<br/><br/>The bustling and advanced dinosaur park has become a jungle of Jurassic, and the overlord there is the terrible creature they created, mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex.<br/><br/>This Tyrannosaurus Rex is much stronger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex in size, strength and intelligence. They are cruel, moody, cunning, crafty and destructive.<br/><br/>Rhodes scientists have been unable to understand why the Tyrannosaurus Rex they created produced runaway genetic mutations. They have been trying to investigate it.<br/><br/>This matter concerns the security of the world and the survival of the rod group.<br/><br/>As early as two years ago, Rhodes sent its own researchers to collect mutant T-Rex eggs and obtain gene samples, but they far underestimated the danger of this task. The T-Rex they created,<br/><br/>They are not as cunning and powerful as Tyrannosaurus Rex.<br/><br/>The 15 personnel they sent, including 5 scientists and 10 guards, were ambushed by the mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex due to inadequate preparation. The whole army was destroyed and no one survived.

Finally, they succeeded in creating their super Tyrannosaurus Rex, but they ate the consequences.<br/><br/>The new Tyrannosaurus Rex is bigger and stronger than the previous generation. Adult Tyrannosaurus rex has a hip height of 7 meters and a body length of 20 meters.<br/><br/>In the process of their growth, they had gene mutations and crazy evolution of power, so that they were out of control, leading to a devastating disaster in Rhodes dinosaur park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex event<br/><br/>The mutant Tyrannosaurus rex has a higher IQ than the previous Tyrannosaurus Rex. They are as cunning and cunning as the Raptor. They know how to hide and cheat. Eight years ago, these Tyrannosaurus Rexs<br/><br/>In their cages, they are kept by breeders like lions in a circus. What people didn't expect is that they know how to hide their strength. Every time the staff tested their strength,<br/><br/>These Tyrannosaurus Rex all worked hard, making people think that this is their greatest strength. As a result, the engineers did not construct the guardrail according to the corresponding safety standards,<br/><br/>As a result, the thickness and firmness of the guardrail can not withstand the full impact of Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the staff know nothing about it. Two years later, Tyrannosaurus rex has entered adulthood. On a rainstorm evening,<br/><br/>They launched an uprising. It was obvious that the reinforced guardrail in the park could not stop its impact.

Years of evolution have made the dinosaurs there part of the island ecosystem.<br/><br/>The mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex became the most powerful overlord.<br/><br/>Rhodes executives and scientists have been unable to understand why the Tyrannosaurus Rex they created produced runaway genetic mutations. They have been trying to investigate this matter.<br/><br/>They must collect the embryos of mutant T-Rex in order to study the details of the gene mutation process and predict the future evolution direction of mutant T-Rex. Each generation of Tyrannosaurus Rex produces uncertain mutations,<br/><br/>Some mutations will make them die, while others will make them more violent and aggressive, whether for the ecological balance of the dinosaur park or the safety of the world,<br/><br/>All pose unpredictable threats. This task is crucial to the survival and development of rod group in the future.<br/><br/>As early as two years ago, Rhodes sent its own staff to collect T-Rex eggs and collect gene samples, but they far underestimated the danger of this task.

They know how to hide and cheat.<br/><br/>Rhodes sent 15 staff, 5 scientists and 10 guards,<br/><br/>I went to the island to collect mutant T-Rex eggs. Due to insufficient preparation, I was ambushed by the mutant T-Rex.

He is also a Superman with super powers.<br/><br/>From birth, he has the ability to move objects through his mind.<br/><br/>He showed this incredible special function in his infancy.<br/><br/>Once, when little Ethan was drinking milk with a bottle, he accidentally dropped the bottle to the ground. His mother was busy answering the phone,<br/><br/>Didn't bother to pick up the bottle. Little Pete cried in a hurry and stretched his little hand to the bottle on the ground 2 meters away from him<br/><br/>As a result, the bottle miraculously flew into his hand. His mother was stunned. The phone didn't hold steady and fell directly to the floor.<br/><br/>At the age of six, he could easily lift the refrigerator by his mind.<br/><br/>As he grows older, his superpowers are constantly improving,<br/><br/>Now in his 30s, he can easily lift the of a car in tons above his head with his mind<br/><br/>Then throw it tens of meters away.<br/><br/>However, superpowers gave him strength, but took away his health.<br/><br/>He is ill because of his super power. Sometimes he will be unconscious for several hours.<br/><br/>He went to the doctor, who told him that this was due to the genetic abnormality of brain nerve cells caused by the long-term use of super power. Only rod company had the corresponding technology and strength to cure his disease.<br/><br/>So Ethan made a conditional exchange with rod company, and Ethan helped rod company go to their company<br/><br/>The dinosaur park collects the eggs of the mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex. After it is completed, rod company helps Ethan cure his disease and gives him a generous bonus as a reward.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Large cities<br/><br/>Located in the south of Rhode Island Dinosaur Park, it is one of the largest tourist reception centers in the world, including accommodation areas, hotels, shopping malls, entertainment centers, etc. it receives a large number of tourists to visit Dinosaur Island every day.<br/><br/>Later, it was forced to close down due to the mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex incident.<br/><br/>Rhode Island has a warm and humid climate and many rainy seasons. Under the scouring of many years of rain, the original clean roads of parks and cities have long been buried by thick soil,<br/><br/>The soil is covered with withered and yellow weeds, and some can even be submerged to the waist.<br/><br/>The original neat houses and buildings have long been damaged by the mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex.<br/><br/>The weedy road was littered with objects.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rescue Ethan Pitt<br/><br/>Ethan finished the task of collecting Tyrannosaurus Rex eggs in the park city. At this time, no Tyrannosaurus Rex appeared. The headquarters of the company sent two helicopters to rescue Ethan, and the rescuers prepared two rescue schemes, AB and ab,<br/><br/>Plan a is to inform Ethan to arrive at a certain place within a certain period of time, and the helicopter drops the rope ladder to rescue<br/><br/>Plan B is to drop the single aircraft backpack carried on the plane to a place on the island and inform Ethan to get it. Due to the rainstorm at that time, the visibility of the road was very low, the wind was very strong, and lightning in the clouds occurred frequently<br/><br/>Tyrannosaurus Rex is active on the island, so<br/><br/>In order to reduce the rescue risk, the headquarters decided to implement plan B. But what they didn't expect was that the pterosaurs on the island attacked the helicopter, and a helicopter crashed under the attack of pterosaurs<br/><br/>All seven crew members were killed, while another helicopter narrowly escaped after dropping the aircraft bag, and the aircraft backpack dropped by the plane was hijacked by pterosaurs in the air, and then the backpack was carried to a height of hundreds of meters by two pterosaurs,<br/><br/>In the struggle and bite of two pterosaurs, there are several batteries in the back<br/><br/>And aircraft engines are scattered all over the park city. Fortunately, the batteries and aircraft are high-strength fall proof and are not damaged. Ethan can only collect these scattered batteries now,<br/><br/>Then find the aircraft, put the battery into the aircraft engine, put it on and escape.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the mutant Tyrannosaurus rex has seen all this for a long time, which seems to be the trap they set. Now the mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex is coming in the direction of Ethan, and Ethan is in a very dangerous situation...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T06:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eaeeec8511bcd0bbea30e05d0b96d182.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Et Superman team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Et Superman team"], "esrb_rating": null}
