You might plan an attack on the Plains of Eorn and fight some dangerous Worn Trolls, so bring some fire magic, or visit the Forests of Bree and get ambushed by The Fae with their regenerative magic. The sky's the limit in this deep combat sim.<br/><br/>Will you save the world from itself?<br/><br/>---Features<br/><ul><li>Every action your heroes take is scripted in advance. If you want to spend weeks gathering herbs while your allies get mowed down fighting The Weevils in The Mountains, that's on you. You should definitely help them, but maybe you'd like to pick their bodies clean after they're defeated. It's up to you.<br/></li><li>Carefully tuned combat system, inspired by the tabletop RPGs you love<br/></li><li>Challenging moment-to-moment gameplay<br/></li><li>Hordes of enemies to study and defeat! Are they too aggressive, and opening themselves to an attack? Do they target your weakest allies first, and you need to guard them?<br/></li><li>Every time you play, you build your legacy, the way you want to.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/8416b4f3f12d3fc72b8d0308051f3dad.jpg", "website": "https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=66588.0", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The World Outside"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["The World Outside"], "esrb_rating": null}
