With special advantages when you put more then three blocks together, you will find different challenges a way to spending time with fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Another unusual feature is that the game takes place in a board with 98 spots disposed in an isometric view, which makes it look diagonal. The borders then makes the fitting a little more difficult, but giving you a greater challenge.</p>\n<p>Are you ready for the challenge?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T02:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aefdd6a2b935396610c27a0c65b5c028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Henning"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
