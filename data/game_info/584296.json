For Windows, just unzip the folder and run Game.exe. I don't know anything about Macs, though lol. If you want a version for Linux, I can do that, too. Just let me know.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move, Z/Enter/Spacebar to confirm, X/Backspace to cancel or pause, Shift to run. The game can also be fully controlled via a mouse or gamepad. Just plug in a USB controller, and it should work fine.</p>\n<p>A JRPG I'm working on. Very early demo of a very early build. Please leave feedback. If you find any glitches, or if you have any ideas for how the game could be improved, leave a comment!</p>\n<p>The king's advisor doesn't have a name yet, so his name appears in the game as 'NAME.' I'm open to suggestions, so feel free to leave a comment with what you think he should be called.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120a1e2eae99e1510cfc2521fcd40c06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Scooterrito"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
