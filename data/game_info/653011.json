He needs to collect ram upgrades to expand his memory size and to not shut down. But the facility he is dumped in is also sinking so as water is rushing in, he needs to escape out of the facility as well as avoid hazards and save other robots.<br/>This is a prototype mostly since we ran into a lot of issues with Unreal editor on version 5 which caused a lot of the ideas we had didn't get implemented or didnt function like we expected. Hopefully it will do well though. A lot of things are missing sadly, but we hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:03:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd4a978e281874365c9794a84c5bda8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xr-s"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
