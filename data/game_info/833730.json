Filling the survey should not take longer than 10-15 minutes and all data is collected anonymously. Once I\u00a0get the final exam done, I\u00a0can assure you that the data collected from the play sessions and from the survey will be deleted.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You have to download the Zip file, unzip it to somewhere on your computer and then you can start playing by opening the \"Procedural Shooter Game.exe\" (Application)\u00a0file. You don\u2019t have to be an experienced player, moreover, for research purposes, it is nice if we can get data from people who usually don\u2019t play any games.<br/><br/>The game contains some known and for certain some unknown bugs as well. Hopefully, you will not experience any game-breaking issues, if you do then restart the game and feel free to mention it in the Survey at the related question. However, I would like to ask you not to try to intentionally break the game, that wouldn't be helpful for my project and it would only skew the collected player telemetry data.</p>\n<p>The game is not used for commercial/business purposes. It is\u00a0purely used as a\u00a0research project for my Thesis.<br/>For my game I have used the following systems for which I do not personally own the rights, so I want to give credits to it's creators:<br/>- Unity's FPS tutorial Microgame template:\u00a0https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template<br/>- DMDungeonGenerator from DMeville:\u00a0https://github.com/DMeville/DMDungeonGenerator<br/>- Luke Moore's Final Project video presentation:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\r\nBy: El\u0151d Vizi\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1252908dfaa2a3afbc07c16c5caff5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vizielod"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
