Spawning Orbs. (just in case if they went extinct)</p>\n<p>2. Spawning Killer Orbs. (To add competition)</p>\n<p>3. Start a disease outbreak in orbs. (they can get immune)</p>\n<p>4. Speed time. (so you won't get board playing)</p>\n<p>5. Call in an Asteroid. (destroys all life on the island)</p>\n<p>6. Kill all orbs at once.
