I naturally went towards a boss fight as it was probably the most viable considering I had to do everything myself. It turned out okay considering the amount of time I had to work on it. It does still have a few bugs and I do need to redo the artwork so that it is my own if I ever release this game fully</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d373a22e3c7397337d841ee81cfc56a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dev_J"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
