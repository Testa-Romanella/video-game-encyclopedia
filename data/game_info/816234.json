But suddenly, as she wanders around her lost paradise, she notices that none of her children are around. In a panic, the Queen starts lifting some of the wreckage and damaged goods in search of them.\u00a0After some time she thinks this is useless and that, being frail and fragile as babies, they probably fled and hid to avoid the predators. This is yet another reason for Queen Arachne to proceed with her revenge. She must now fulfill her role as a mother, and above all, protector of her own species and set an example for her children.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T11:27:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db68b0cd9000e441b23aa87317a9bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["filipelipe10", "Oliiveiira", "ritamalaquias"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
