I'm testing if people will like the idea.<br/><br/>Your objective is to reach at the farthest right point. There is a plane which drops bombs at you, you must avoid bombs.<br/><br/>If it gets enough positive responses, I intent to port it to mobile and send to publishers. Levels will be generated procedurally, platforms will be generated till player dies.</p>\n<p> Visuals are currently crappy, I know. The purpose is to test the game mechanic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc5/cc5dedd4f580442b6c498a6588ac2790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
