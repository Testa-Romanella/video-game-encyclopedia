Behind Closed Doors plays for about 50 minutes, and is split into two sections. In the first half, it is just a normal week for Ethan; waking up, going to work, coming home, go to bed and repeat. But after a few days, something strange happens. Ethan gets an unusual phone call in the middle of the night, and is somehow teleported to another dimension. Ethan must then complete a few trials to get back to the real world.<h3>Gamplay</h3><br/>Work at an office job and build an indie game with your co workers, and play test it, getting it ready for release.
