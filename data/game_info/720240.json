At the start of the game and every 2 dialogue changes you'll have a chance to serve yourself a Mate(A local Herb infusion that I like to call reverse tea) by pressing the space bar. This will award you points depending on how full it was.<br/></p>\n<p>It probably has some typos, I wrote it in a hurry since I lost most of what I had written when unity decided to crash on me yesterday. Also I know it's not perfect but I did everything in it, from the sprites to the music and the code, So I'm kinda proud of it<br/></p><p>You may quit the game once your Final Score appears.<br/></p><p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click = advance dialogue</p>\n<p>Space-bar = Serve mate Every 2 dialogues.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afeb5188e2a6682f609558800cf01854.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["elebolt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
