The core mechanic is <strong>splitting the display of your computer</strong> so each player can see only his<strong> half of the screen</strong> (the most handy tool for the task seems to be a large notepad).</p>\n<p>The game contains 6 characters, each defined by 3 specific kinds of accessories (eg. pirate wearing a tricorne hat, eye patch and a parrot).</p>\n<p>Each player has a virtual deck of cards to draw from. Drawing cards one by one, each card can be either worn on your character mannequin (discarding the previously worn piece) or discarded. Discarded cards are placed at the bottom of opponent\u2019s deck. Each round lasts for 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>Each player has a goal character type to aim for to dress, which can be changed throughout the game, depending on the cards you\u2019re receiving. Also, based on the cards your opponent is discarding, you can guess your opponent\u2019s goal.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS (left player, right player)</p>\n<ul><li>WEAR (S | Numpad 5)</li><li>DISCARD (D | Numpad 4)</li><li>CHANGE MY CHARACTER GOAL (W | Numpad 8)</li><li>CHANGE MY OPPONENT GOAL GUESS (X | Numpad 2)</li></ul>\n<p>GOALS:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>dress </strong>your character according to your goal</li><li><strong>guess </strong>opponents goal</li></ul>\n<p>The game was created in less than 48 hours for\u00a0Global Game Jam 2014, the theme was:</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>We don\u2019t see things as they are, we see them as we are.</strong>\u201c.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve been the organizer of the event, I did not upload the game to the GGJ site.</p><p><strong>Date</strong>: 01/2014\u00a0<br/><strong>Tools</strong>: OpenFL / HaXe, GIMP, Audacity, pug<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e822295e961db840b49e1a3942f4b1cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarnik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
