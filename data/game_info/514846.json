It is even hosted in a real BBS. You can connect to the BBS at\u00a0Baud BBS\u00a0or if you feel really adventuresome, download an ANSI client like\u00a0SyncTerm\u00a0and give it a whirl old school style.</p>\n<p>Just log into the BBS and create an account. After the login, you will be taken to the\u00a0Baud BBS game menu.</p>\r\nIntroduction\r\n<p>In the late 2020\u2019s corporations lost trust in the internet. It no longer represented a safe place to operate. After searching, it was decided to resurrect dial-up modem operations - they could be highly restricted and compression was to the point where complex programs could be shrunk into a single byte size location (called nano-programs). These systems only needed a small memory space to operate and a small number of exposed ports and allowed only limited power terminals to connect - the Apple //.</p>\n<p>Soon enough, these systems were under surveillance and then under attack. Although the surface area for attack was reduced to a few well-protected modem ports, the attacks came anyway. ICE and heavy copy protection was deployed to stop the Runners, usually rival operators from other corporations, from penetrating security to loot and disrupt the Core.</p>\n<p>You are an employee, an operator, a runner. Your mission is to help the corporation achieve its objectives both on-site and off. It won\u2019t be easy - it will require coordination with other operators, smarts to source what is necessary, intelligence and fast reaction speed to crack various puzzles and defeat the rival corporations, while protecting your home system from being flanked by competing corporations.</p>\n\r\nReddit Sharing Saturday Posts:\r\n<p>Intro, Take &amp; Delete, Level Generation pt. 1, FOV, NPC Behaviors,Keys, Kernel and Hunger pt 1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T09:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee10452115580c38e9fa011c6dddb2dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Baud BBS Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
