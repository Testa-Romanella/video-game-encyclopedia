The idea of \u201cA Grim Fate\u201d is to show that death is so natural as life and that it is only one more process in the cycle of living beings. The player will have to go through a number of trials during the game where the narrative is mixed with his choices and thus learn about the importance of death and reflect on our path as humans. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ce/0ce87dd4c35a4c51312aafc9b4b71a8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["isabellabs", "ivoamaro", "bernardobc", "MiguelDuarte"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
