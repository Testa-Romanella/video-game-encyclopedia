My first game jam entry.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I\u00a0misread the 10 day period as being a start date of 10th May, which meant I\u00a0only had a few days as I\u00a0was\u00a0leaving on holiday - so this was literally mostly written during breakfast time over 5 days. I\u00a0knew I\u00a0couldn't get close to a finished game in that time, which gave me the idea of writing a game including unfinished games :)</p>\n<p>The game is a Windows executable written with Unity. I tried uploading a WebGL version, but there was no sound and the screen size was wrong.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T09:23:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8fff4594771ff251c79e73c307c71b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dTMSr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
