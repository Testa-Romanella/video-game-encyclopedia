Are you sure that floor is <em>really </em>there? Is that a wall, or a passageway in disguise? You'll have to figure it out if you want to reach the end.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD\u00a0 keys to move</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>Space to jump</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Early Access Notes</em></strong></p>\n<p>Prispective is still in development, and this is a very, <em>very</em>, early build. As such, many things will change as the game develops. I am currently planning on adding or changing the following:</p>\n<ul><li>New and revamped levels</li><li>An actual options menu</li><li>Music</li><li>Ensuring the colors are pleasing to the eye for extended periods while also being colorblind friendly</li><li>Optimization </li><li>MAC version</li><li>Better presentation</li><li>Generally adding polish to all aspects of the game</li></ul>\n<p>While the game's full release will have a set price, during this Early Access period, downloads are set to Pay What You Want. I'd certainly appreciate you throwing a couple bucks my way to support me and my projects, but don't feel obligated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b0454f8028796d248f81ff5c60f149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeusVerve"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
