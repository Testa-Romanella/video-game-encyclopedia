No audio because Unity literally said no. Credits in the description. The goal is the prevent your phone from bricking because Bapple only gives you like 8 gb of memory and it already took like 7 for \"Settings\". Anyways, hope you enjoy!</p><p>Bugs I already know and probably will never fix:</p><ul><li>Sound, duh. Thank you Unity.</li><li>If you get a board that has no matches, you just have to restart the browser.</li><li>The slider is your timer, how much time you got left. It probably goes too quick.</li><li>The slider can be touched by players. Slide it to the top I\u00a0dare you.</li><li>Once the slider reaches the top the game ends...\u00a0Kinda. The process running the game will end. You will have to restart the browser to play again.</li></ul>\n<p>P.S. Never again will I use Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T16:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/47899e7d265ec650109b0205121a0435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hero's Code"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
