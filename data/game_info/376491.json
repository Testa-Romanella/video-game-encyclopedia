There are unlikely to be any major new features added, but see the devlog for plans for the future.</p>\n<br/>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>There are three options at the main menu screen.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Harbour.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>This is a mostly-enclosed space\u00a0 in which to try out maneuvering with sails. Open the\u00a0<strong>tutorial</strong>\u00a0window (from a button at the bottom left of the screen) to get started.</li><li><strong>Battle.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>Two frigates, broadside to broadside. You can control both ships - press\u00a0<strong>tab</strong>\u00a0to switch between them.</li><li><strong>The World.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>This starts you at the Canary islands, well-placed to sail to the Americas or towards the Indian ocean. Or you can open the map and\u00a0<strong>ctrl+click</strong>\u00a0to teleport anywhere. The buttons at the bottom right control your rate through and position in time. There is accurate seasonal weather.</li></ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<ul><li>Expect to see some placeholder graphics and UI elements, debug menus etc.\u00a0</li><li>The physics can be glitchy, especially for falling spars</li><li>The sea occasionally disappears in\u00a0 rough weather</li><li>Teleport sometimes doesn't go quite where you click</li><li>Hold down shift as you start the game to open a menu to change resolution</li></ul>\n<p>How the ship handles is a mix of best-guesses and hacky physics. I'm happy to hear suggestions on how it could be improved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5c2296cccc23bf98e0a118e5650bedc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neil Thapen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
