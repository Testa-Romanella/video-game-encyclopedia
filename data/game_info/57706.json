Racing Lagoon is neither an ordinary RPG nor a car racing game.<br />\nIf it is an ordinary RPG, it is called a field map. The player travels in his car through the city.<br />\nYou can step on the brakes and accelerate between passing cars, already at this point you can enjoy it like a mini racing game. The battle is car racing. Cars encountered on the street map, from the opponent or from yourself &quot;passing&quot; and enter the race mode, various places (course) and race conditions will appear.<br />\nJust like powering up weapons and magic, in the Racing Lagoon, remodeling your car (machine complete) is the key to victory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-10T21:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/310/3101b5af7788008e55314131e52bd350.jpg", "website": "https://www.jp.square-enix.com/game/detail/rl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 588, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Square", "Square Product Development Division 2"], "genres": ["RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Square"], "esrb_rating": null}
