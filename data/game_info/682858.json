'62 people' will be available until the end of 2016 for PC, Mac and Linux.\n\n'62 people' is the brainchild of Outhouse Media and has been developed by Austin Stone (Austin Stone, 'Quantum Break'), Austin Manche (Artefact 3D, 'SCA: [The] Skills of Champions'), Troy Saing (Thunderstone, 'Mechanix'), Mikene Croisette (ESRB, 'Mass Effect'), Nick Cross (Gangnam Style), and Ryan Cole (Quantic Dream, 'Fate/stay night').\n\nA huge Thanks goes to Bill Diamond for the professional video editing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b05fc88b9977750b44b2684efa54a46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
