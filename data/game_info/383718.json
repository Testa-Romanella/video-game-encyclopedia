Petrol-heads want to see each other dead and are already waiting for you in the car arena to start an insane car fight. Two robots, one winner. Nobody knows who will survive in this car-to-car shooting game. No time to explain! Join the game and test your betting skills. Are you ready to make some serious profits?<br/><br/>In this battle game, you don\u2019t have to run a car fast, hit the gas in a rampage, or burn up the road! Your only task is to guess who will tear up the arena and become the winner of the battle. All actions are simulated right on your screen. Robots will shoot and crash their rivals by driving the armed supercar. <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The concept of this game is very simple, and racing skills are not necessary. All you need to do is chase away all your fear and bet on the robot you think has the best combination of handling, performance, and grip.<br/> <br/>In this mortal combat, you don\u2019t decide what your robot fighter is like. Your robot will be created randomly from different parts. If your deadly robot knocks off his rival and survives after the car smash, you\u2019ll earn virtual currency. Results are based entirely on luck and your skills of prediction in the tournaments. The amount of coins you win also depends on the room. Better room, better prize. Feel the risk as you dive into the atmosphere of the crash arena and hit the big time!
