Shoot with left and right click.</p>\n<p>Shoot as many enemys as possible before you get killed.</p>\n<p>Left mouse shoots a normal shot and right mouse click shoots a homing missle, which targets an random enemy. The player does not get damage when an enemy passes, to make the game a little bit more fun :)<br/>It is also intended that the enemies can shoot through asteroids, they only should hit you :)<br/>When more missles explode: then their target is dead and there is no enemy available. This is intended.<br/></p>\n<p>If the missles are stuck, try waiting with shooting after spawning, you might overwhelm it in the beginning ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c33d97894939692ccde1a8d893fc0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Agentry"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
