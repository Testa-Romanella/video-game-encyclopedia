This is a pretty straightforward visual novel so don't expect much of that fancy 'gameplay' stuff. Just a lot of words to read, a few choices to make and some boobs (and ribages!) to ogle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fb179175f94a92ba3c2cd01ad5d6f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberScherzo Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CyberScherzo Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
