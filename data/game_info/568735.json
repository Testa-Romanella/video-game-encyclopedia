You can play the game completely normal and you'll be fine but if you want to get a good highscore you will need to fail your fellow humans very hard. For example by feeding them the food that they absolutely hate or throwing a basketball into their face.<br/></p><p><strong><em>What We Learned This Jam:</em></strong></p><p>We are three dudes from Germany who just made their first game together. </p>\n<p>We decided it would be a brilliant idea for our very first project to make a minigame collection. We planned 3 games and barely got to \"polish\" 2 of them.</p><p>We learned that the scope of your game is an important thing to keep in mind. We were 1 artist and 2 programmers on this project and there was just not enough time to make a fully fleshed out minigame collection without any night-shifts. Even though we \"only\" got to make 2 games we are still very proud because we also learned how to properly use Unity. Before only one of us had ever used it longterm to develop games.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game and feedback is <strong>always</strong> welcome. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/734e1e31cc23c68f01b529725429c098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2Shy2Shine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
