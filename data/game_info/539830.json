To be honest though, it's pretty dangerous out there, you don't really have to go: You could just stay home in the safe confines of your village and relax if you want to \u2014 maybe do a little farming?</p>\n<p>Set Forth is a minimalistic, retro-styled RPG game where, ironically, you don't have to set forth on an adventure. It's much harder to build a name for yourself by playing the game safe, but your total score by the end of your life is multiplied by your dangerous accomplishments. If you die however, your total score is cut in half (as opposed to retiring), and you'll lose everything you've built.</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/C7eGVTV</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:46:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/5261e82154d094c43e2ca9bef21fc7f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fixer90"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
