While the castle's construction was almost over, a storm ravaged the country and the lord was killed along with his family. This left the castle abandoned for many years.<br/>A decade later, a traveler came across a small village lost in the deepest parts of the country. Folks there were terrified of an\u00a0abandoned castle on the other side of a forest\u00a0and it's\u00a0menacing silhouette. They told the traveler\u00a0stories of villagers entering the castle's walls and never coming back, and claimed to have seen\u00a0dark creatures roaming the skies around the castle's towers.<br/>As a proud member of a guild of traveler, the lone traveler decided to see for himself if the stories were true and headed into the castle by himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>J - Jump<br/>L - Attack<br/>K- Dash<br/></p>\n<p>Advice : If you're stuck, try dashing while holding up</p>\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong><br/>Design - TomKai<br/>Code - OshDubh, D3C0D<br/>Music - Asiago<br/>Art - iMonk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5dc3d62b9ea2a9672b2e39aef987431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tomkai", "imonk", "OshDubh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
