Have fun playing around with this ball made of springs, lots of springs.</p>\n<p>For now it's just a sandbox game, but if you like it I might design levels. Just leave a comment if you want me to improve the game.<br/></p><p>Download the game to avoid the loading time, have better shadows and lights, and probably better performance too.<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the sound effects are mouth sounds. The teleport is made with bfxr.</p>\n<p>3D assets are made with Blender. I used a few assets from Unity's Standard Assets too.<br/></p>\n<p>Music by<strong> LEMMiNO </strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://soundcloud.com/lemmino/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c018b4177ebc44b5acc2754fcdb782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Space Monkey"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
