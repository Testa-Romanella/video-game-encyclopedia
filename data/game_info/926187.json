It is melee combat based and focused on outplaying your opponent. Each player can be controlled by the keyboard or controller with the appropriate mapping software.</p>\n<p>When one player kills the other an extra soldier appears on their team giving them extra lives and when a player runs out of soldiers they lose. Additionally players have to attack each other or the tree will die unless someone dies. When the tree dies the game is over.</p>\n<p><strong>This is mainly a prototype</strong> for what we think is an interesting gameplay loop that could be expanded upon, it was originally for GGJ 2023 but it wasn't done by the deadline it took an extra day to get to the condition it is in now.</p>\n<p><strong>Let us know what you think!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Player controls: A and D to walk X to attack\u00a0<br/></strong><strong>Right player controls: Left and right arrow to walk M to attack</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/479/479683b98b134f8e41341a79c30c2a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["AbdallahSaid01"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
