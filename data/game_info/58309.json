Design your park as you like. There are all sorts of facilities for you to construct. And of course, good management is key to ensuring the park prospers, bringing in lots of visitors.<br/><br/>But a park is not just for people. It's for animals too! Invite scaly, feathered and furry friends to your park and they will make it their home if they like it! Make your park hospitable to animals by adding trees, shrubs, and other natural elements to it. Some curious critters will come to check out your park attracted by certain facilities!<br/><br/>When you start running out of space, grab a pickaxe and make more land usable, also finding various materials in the process. These materials can be used to upgrade your facilities, or even make special items!<br/><br/>There are lots of fun challenges for you to try, too. Nurse saplings until they grow into fine trees, have visitors compete to catch lots of fish, and see if you can hatch various birds and reptiles.<br/><br/>Create a phenomenal, world-famous park, loved by people and animals alike!<br/><br/>Try searching for \"Kairosoft\" to see all of our games!!<br/><br/>Developer Homepages.
