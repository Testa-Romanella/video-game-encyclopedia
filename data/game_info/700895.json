To control the player character you will only need to press down the left mouse button (slowing down time and creating pointers towards a maximum of three enemies) before releasing it to dash, your direction is controlled by your\u00a0mouse. Dashing through an enemy will kill them, I hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p><p>(As a side note: I enjoyed this jam, I would have loved to have spent more time on my entry but unfortuantely the last day was mostly\u00a0taken up by my job. )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:24:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/1399339bf9aae2676cfd5b8575168038.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmeraldRailgun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
