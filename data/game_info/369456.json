More and more stars and entire galaxies are turning into black holes consuming everything in their way. Eventually these black holes also consume each other, forming a universe consisting only of super black holes.<br/><br/>The black holes slowly evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, leaving a universe consisting of nothing but a cold dark void. The big freeze is happening right now.<br/><br/>It is up to you, Eli, to rescue the elementary particles and the elements from our universe. You have to take them through rifts in space time to a safe parallel universe, preserving them from extinction. Journeying through the game you will rescue your friends Pomi, the proton, and Noemi, the neutron, thereafter you can chose to play as these characters as well.<br/><br/>This is the lite version of the game.</p>\n<p>Available on App Store and Google Play</p>\n<p>App Store</p>\n<p>Google Play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7f/c7fca3d393398830695028fc83b70953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Impact Games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
