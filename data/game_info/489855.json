I basically rewrote the entire game once, and ended up rewriting the player and enemy controllers several times. I had a lot more features planned for the prototype than what's in it right\u00a0now, but I simply ran out of time!</p><p>There is no win condition - use the 'restart' button to fight more holograms!</p>\n<p>I have the makings of an\u00a0AI state machine going using the Animator, but I\u00a0didn't get very far with it because I only just discovered how to use the Animator for AI a few days ago. I do plan to have some fun with it though...</p>\n<p>I'm proud of what I\u00a0managed to accomplish in the past month with this game. It has what I feel is fairly decent movement, a cool parallax background and enemies that have differences in how fast they react and a little bit of variety in what they do!</p>\n<p>ASSET CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Gunshot sound: http://soundbible.com/2123-40-Smith-Wesson-8x.html<br/>Bullet impact sound: https://freesound.org/people/Rock%20Savage/sounds/81042/<br/>Melee miss 'whiff' sound: https://freesound.org/people/kingsrow/sounds/182693/<br/>Melee hit 'whack' sound: https://freesound.org/people/Ekokubza123/sounds/104183/\u00a0<br/>Death explosion sound: https://freesound.org/people/Anomaex/sounds/490253/<br/>Dodge whiff sound: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/44-1-general-library-free-s...<br/>BGM: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/rock/funky-blues-rock-jam-free...</p>\n<p>FONTS</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/distort-me.font<br/>https://www.dafont.com/type-wrong.font</p>\n<p>MY PAGES</p>\n<p>http://technitaur.tumblr.com/<br/>https://twitter.com/jeniferirwin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/051/05141bb890144bf9b83169604d4c98d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["technitaur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
