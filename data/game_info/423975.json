Play a wizard, a succubus, and a rogue in this epic series of text-based games.<br/><br/>Here, old-school doesn\u2019t mean primitive. There are hundreds of achievements to uncover\u2014from the silly and surprising to the epic. As you make choices, stats go up and down, with rarely an \u201cinstant death\u201d. You have ready options for going back on choices while gripping you with a sense of suspense and challenge.<br/><br/>\u2022 SIMPLE, YET ADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY.<br/>Medieval Fantasy RPG is dead-simple to learn, yet hard to master. You read and make choices, that\u2019s it, but the consequences of your choices are not always obvious.<br/><br/>It's like a series of your favorite fantasy novels, but gamified to be even more awesome!<br/><br/>Soon you will be immersed in an RPG richer than any you have played before because your own imagination is driving what you see, hear, and touch.<br/><br/>\u2022 PLAY A MASSIVE, WELL-THOUGHT-OUT STORY!<br/>This huge series of intertwining story lines is made up of over 1 MILLION words! Over 7 years has gone into the development!<br/><br/>You start off playing a character in search of glory and loot, but soon delve into a world of deadly conspiracy and parallel universes. Later, the story continues as you switch to playing a succubus (demon), and then a rogue\u2014each with their own personality and goals.<br/><br/>Also, there\u2019s more on the way! Like a good D&amp;D campaign, it doesn\u2019t end.<br/><br/>\u2022 ACTUALLY FREE AND NO PAYING FOR A CHOICE.<br/>Play well and you will be rewarded with the currency you need to finish everything without spending a penny. Hunt down those achievements, get the high ranks, and choose to watch the rewarded videos as they become available. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate your monetary support and I\u2019m confident that you will find it well worth it, but know that you do not have to.<br/><br/>Unlike many choice-based games, you do NOT spend currency to make choices. No choice is walled off from you for need of gems, etc. nor is there any such hint to spoil which is the \u201cbetter choice\u201d. You choose!<br/><br/>\u2022 REAL ROLE-PLAYING.<br/>To succeed, you must put yourself in the boots of your character and do what\u2019s best for him or her, even if it\u2019s not what you would normally do. This requires more than logic, but also empathy for your character and the situation he/she finds themselves in. This is role-playing in its purest form.<br/><br/>\u2022 EASY ON BATTERY AND STORAGE. EVEN PLAY OFFLINE!<br/>Although this is a huge interactive story, offering many hours of enjoyment, it\u2019s a tiny download and you can even play offline.<br/><br/>\u2022 WHAT'S INCLUDED.<br/>This package of text-based games includes the entire Wizard's Choice series (6 large adventures), Demon's Choice (7 chapters so far), all of the Rogue's Choice series (15 chapters so far), and Ranger's Choice.
