Supercharge your armor, discover new powerful weapons, and kick some ass, as you fight through treacherous hordes of enemies. Can you survive the bloodbath?<br/><br/>Try not to lose your shoes when you get thrown into a chaotic world without any kind of direction. Suddenly surrounded by dangerous enemies, your instincts set in with only one goal in mind: survival. You start out with a base set of Tier 1 weapons: the 'Pistol', 'Ray Gun', and 'Shotgun'. With the shopkeepers help (Greg) you may choose to upgrade your tier of weapons or invest in a set of armor. The overwhelming wave of enemies forces you to maneuver your way around this hazardous game world in order to reach safety. Choose your playing style including a rush strategy, grind strategy, and/or choosing a defensive or offense class for your player. Be careful as you new and improved enemies will continue to attack you, making you rethink your every move!<br/><br/>The game has a shooting mechanic not like most games, with the ability to only shoot left and right in a top down world you are forced to use the game world to your advantage. You'll need to figure out on your own the best fighting strategy to use. Blood is a serious part of our game, for every kill you achieve the blood splatters spawned what we call 'Blood points' or bp. Use these blood points as a shop currency created once in every new zone.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Over 40 different enemies and bosses<br/></li><li>LOTS of weapons<br/></li><li>Tiered weaponry: make sure to upgrade!<br/></li><li>Different classes, multiple fighting strategies<br/></li><li>Use Blood Points as currency<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles<br/></li><li>Overcome environmental hazards/obstacles<br/></li><li> Seven Zones to conquer </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c558cd55d06ec6e0e097be1bff0676a.jpg", "website": "http://www.codingmadesimple.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 41}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachary Berenger", "Eli Aldinger"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Black Shell Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
