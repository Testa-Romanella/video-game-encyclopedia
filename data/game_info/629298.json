The limitation for this game was to include dice as a mechanic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a\u00a0bullet hell dungeon crawler where your life hinges on dice rolls. Every time you enter a room, dice are rolled. If you get hit after they finish rolling, they will be flipped to the next number.\u00a0Once all three dice are showing 6, it's game over!</p>\n<p>Other instructions are in-game.</p>\n<p>This game has no audio, I didn't get to it in time :(. While playing,\u00a0I\u00a0recommend listening to rock, or some other fast-paced music that goes along with the vibe!</p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0entirely by me, except for the fonts which are a Kenney asset!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4148399e6759af22fe1091833a5100f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cosmomoney"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
