The original Smash Bros fangame, most popular for content and difficulty, rather than gameplay, Super Smash Flash was\u2026well, Super Smash in a Flash. It showed very few similarities to the actual Smash Bros gameplay as it was our first game, yet still somehow attracted large crowds of people. Now, with the knowledge we\u2019ve picked up along the way, we\u2019re striving for the utmost quality this time around. Super Smash Flash 2 is not a game made by one person in a month, like SSF1. Super Smash Flash 2 is a game made by hundreds of people over several years. It will be one of the biggest Smash bros fan-games \u2013 no. One of the biggest Flash games, to date.
