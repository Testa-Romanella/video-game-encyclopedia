You can lose HP when taking damages from the zorgs but also by suffocation. Build garages to restore HP.</p>\n\r\nOxygen\r\n<p>When you have no oxygen left, you start loosing HP (then you die and it's game over). You loose oxygen over time. Build greenhouses to restore oxygen.</p>\n\r\nEnergy\r\n<p>When you have no energy left, you move very slowly (hope you're not chased by a brood). Build nuclear plants to restore energy.</p>\n\r\nBuild\r\nPlanets\r\n<p>There are different types of planet (colors). Each type has its own facilities that you can build on it. Choose wisely, as you can build only one by planet.</p>\n\r\nMinerals\r\n<p>You can find minerals floating around in space.  With that you can build facilities on planets. You can get more minerals  by building mines. <br/></p>\n\r\nFight\r\n<p>The zorgs are your enemies. The zorg Hive infests planets with nests. Brood and Spiters are born in nests. The more nests, the harder. Kill the Hive to win the game.<br/></p>\r\nAmmo\r\n<p>I'm sure you got it, but just in case, you can't shoot if you have no ammo. Build factories to restore your ammo. <br/></p>\n\r\nBarracks\r\n<p>This facility builds space robots to defend the planet. You can also order them to attack the hive by pressing A when flying over the barracks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:28:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f0306cf928e4acd459169bdabecab37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
