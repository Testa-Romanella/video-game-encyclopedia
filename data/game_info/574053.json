This was made to recreate/show a sort of \"What could have been\" sorta thing with pizza tower! Some things have been improved or changed slightly compared to the reference video, and some artistic liberties have been taken. Some level design has been adjusted too. Below are controls and questions that I will answer.</p>\n<p>~~Controls~~<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys - Move/Ladder</p>\n<p>Z - Jump</p>\n<p>X- Charge</p>\n<p>Up + Z - Highjump</p>\n<p>Down while falling - Freefall</p>\n<p>~~Questions~~</p>\n<p>\"Is this official?\" No this is fanmade, but I tried my hardest to recreate it as best as physically possible.<br/>\"Are there any notable changes?\" The only notable changes are in the room with the sausage toppin, i made a small space to get back down since in the original it would softlock since the key is below.</p>\n<p>\"Why is noise here?\" I added noise for no real reason, he wasnt originally a part of the game in this era but I thought i'd add him because why not.</p>\n<p>\"Will there be more levels?\" After I recreate most of the early levels, probably not. Maybe custom ones in their own category? if interest is shown.</p>\n<p>\"Why do you continue to make pizza tower fangames despite the fact you have other projects\u00a0and fangames?\" I don't know. I just like making fangames and expressing my love for a game or series. Plus I just enjoy making games!<br/><br/>\"Why is it on browser?\"<br/>Cuz that just be how the engine I use do.\u00a0It can make EXEs but web is better, plus more people can play :)</p>\n<p>References used for the game are all at:</p>\n<p>The Leaning Tower of \ud83c\udf55: Archive (tumblr.com)</p>\n<p>Credits :</p>\n<p>Pizza Tower Guy/Tour\u00a0De\u00a0Pizza: The entirety of Pizza Tower</p>\n<p>Dim Widdy/Post Elvis - Funiculi theme, title theme</p>\n<p>Mineken - Pepperoni goblin recreation</p>\n<p>Core - Water level asset recreate</p>\n<p>PinPan - coding/recreation of other sprites, anything custom</p>\n<p>Wario Land 2/Nintendo - Sound FX</p>\n<p>Sonic Mania - Hydrocity theme\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yo noid 2 - Boss Theme</p>\n<p>MrSauceman - Spooky Tower</p>\n<p>Spongebob creature from the Krusty Krab - Patty Chase 3</p>\n<p>I do not own the audio or characters, they belong to their respective owners.</p>\n<p>If any of the owners of the music wish for me to replace them or take them out, I will do so.
