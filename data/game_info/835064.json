That's right!</p>\n<p>Play as a place's server and deliver a variety of fries! Explore the wacky, odd world of the game.</p>\n<p>You can download the game below! If you want to provide us some feedback, please feel free to fill this form! Thanks a lot!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Entertaining gameplay<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Frieseria aims to provide a cozy, yet sometimes fast-paced gameplay flow with its zany direction and art style.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Continuous progression<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You unlock new toppings and tools as you move forward, to expand your toolset! You can keep track of your achievements, which will provide even more unlockables later on!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay variety<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Characters are procedurally generated, and so are their orders. You get to apply every single topping, making versatile fries - paying attention to their shape as well as frying time!</p>\n<p><strong>Appearances of other games</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to the Totem platform, we're able to share experiences between GAMES and forward states/accomplishments of the player! Every Totem game has interpreted events from other games of the platform. Frieseria collaborates in that manner with Island Ambush and Dungeon Sim!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>YOU in the game!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can log in using Totem, displaying your avatar as the player! Speaking of which, you'll also be able to equip your melee weapon to wield a customized grater - transferring the damage value to boost the grater's efficiency.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Make everything go wrong! (WIP; TBA)<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is the core of Frieseria, the true module that distinguishes it from other restaurant management games. Before jumping into it though, the foundations must be laid down. Once everything's good to go, the ultimate purpose is to become the \"Binding of Isaac of restaurant games\", offering rich replayability and a REALLY, I mean REALLY broad outcome list for several situations. I hope you're as excited as we are!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game is made possible by Totem.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T17:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f61eb6c7f5c0db0a4e127e6d5e40ae23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["AdamKormos"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
