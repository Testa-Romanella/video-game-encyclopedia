You can clear the screen at will or the game will wipe itself after 3 seconds of drawing unless the toggle check is turned off. You can also erase what you drew by right clicking and dragging the mouse on whatever you had drawn previously. Sounds will be heard when creating the objects. The objects drawn will have the laws of gravity apply to them. There is a shake option which will shake the whole screen and its contents. You have the option to turn off the sound as well. Slow motion as a concept of time has also been implemented in this sprint.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b003646142d44455d7084b018010e0c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maulikcr7"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
