My first idea was an RPG about characters exploring the artic in an ancient sailing ship from they found under the ice. However with one week left, I had barely finished the beginning, so I decided to make a short escape game using the RPG assets I had on hand. This required me to quadruple the size of the original assets, which came out a lot better than I expected they would, though some are slightly pixelated.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys the game. </p><p>Update: I included the credits in game, but decided to include them in the description too. Any asset not mentioned was either a public domain asset I had on hand or drawn directly in Wick Editor.</p><p>Music -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through The Universe</p>\n<p>Author: vitalezzz</p>\n\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/through-the-universe</p>\n<p>Splitting Wood</p>\n<p>Author: Mike Koenig</p>\n<p>https://soundbible.com/1479-Splitting-Wood.html</p>\n<p>boiling water loops</p>\n<p>Author: TinyWorlds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/boiling-water-loops</p><p>Graphics -</p>\n<p>Axe Survival Tool</p>\n<p>Author: bevouliin.com</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/axe-survival-tool</p>\n<p>Frozen Lake (Modifications were made)</p>\n<p>Author: MouthlessGames</p>\n\n<p>Floor ([LPC] Wooden ship tiles) (Modifications were made)</p>\n<p>Author: Reemax</p>\n\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-wooden-ship-tiles</p><p>Table, Sofa, Fireplace, Vase/rose</p>\n<p>Author: Sharm</p>\n<p>Attribution Instructions:\u00a0Please credit Lanea Zimmerman</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-interior-castle-tiles</p>\n<p>Painting frame (Modifications were made)</p>\n<p>Author: Sharm</p>\n<p>Attribution Instructions:\u00a0Please credit Lanea Zimmerman</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-interior-castle-tiles</p>\n<p>Wall (Originally a bridge) (Modifications were made)</p>\n<p>Author: Possibly a rework of Sharm.
