There are\u00a0dungeons filled with\u00a0puzzles that I haven't had any direct control over making.\u00a0The level design has been placed into the hands of random generation. Whether or not this makes for fun puzzles\u00a0is debatable.</p>\n<p>2. The player has limited control of their can attacks, only being able to attack from two places in the level at a time.</p>\n<p>The core mechanic is that when you die you drop a turret and re-spawn. You can go back to where you died and then fire the turret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other mechanics in the game are built around the idea of passing through an area and then dying and having to repeat it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/9713a3f0ff1c70c70a9984c2ac0bd593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["delfoer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
