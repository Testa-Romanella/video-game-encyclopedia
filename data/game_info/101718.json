{"id": 101718, "slug": "super-blobland", "name": "Super Blobland", "name_original": "Super Blobland", "description": "<p>Super Blobland is a little action-platformer inspired by the original Gameboy era. You run, you jump, you shoot. It's pretty hard. I got the inspiration to make it replaying the Gameboy Megaman games. I find modern games with way too many menus and tutorials boring, and I thought 'what was wrong with games like this?' (figure of speech; there were <em>definitely </em>things wrong with them). I thought there could still be a market for them if they were priced at just a couple of dollars, so I made one, and priced it at just a couple of dollars. The game was more or less a solo project in Unity/C#, although lots of the music and a few other odds and ends are creative commons. I actually made it a few years ago, but I'm posting it here to see if there's any interest in my doing more updates or a 'deluxe' version, which I'd love to do.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/331fbf34d0b602a05bc177fd4a954441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chahl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
