Made in Godot.</p>\r\nProject GENIO\r\n<p>Welcome to Project G.E.N.I.O.! It stands for \r\nGenetically Edited and Neurologically Improved Organism. \r\nWe are a group of german scientist who totally understand good morals. In this experiment we are training the navigation and \r\nreaction abilities of cockroaches. To do this, we have \r\nimplanted a brainchip in the cockroaches heads. The chip helps \r\nus to read the cockroaches brain data, we can manually put \r\nthem to sleep and we can even make them die when they hit a wall. This is totally legal!</p>\r\nThe Potatoe\r\n<p>The cockroaches really seem to like potatoes. We think that \r\nit has something to do with the brainchip we gave them. But \r\nwho cares. The important part is that they love potatoes and \r\nwould do everything to get one. So we put potatoes at the end of mazes so they know where to go.</p>\n\r\nThe Shoppy Rock\r\n<p>There is an easter egg in this game. It looks like this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/615c7721a2d0e76b3105d10cca7d3451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["morfy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
