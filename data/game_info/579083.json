There is a Pong clone made by @encelo, a Flappy Bird clone made by @Vasile-Peste, and a Breakout clone under development by @mat3. I opted for a Super Mario Bros clone.</p>\n<p>The idea is to follow the steps of CS50's lecture 4 by using nCine instead of Love2D.</p>Assets\r\n<p>Some of the assets used by this project are freely available on itch.io:</p>\n<ul><li>Pixel art Metroidvania asset pack by o_lobster.</li><li>Nature platformer tileset by rottingpixels.</li><li>Castle platformer tileset by\u00a0rottingpixels.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4e92fe414384c6fc43aa0773af5577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fahien"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
