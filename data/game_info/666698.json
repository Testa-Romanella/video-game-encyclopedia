{"id": 666698, "slug": "mirror-castle", "name": "Mirror Castle", "name_original": "Mirror Castle", "description": "<p><em>If you want to play in fullscreen then read known issues at the bottom of the page!</em></p>\n<p>This game was made by three people (mostly two...) for the VimJam2 game jam in ten days. The theme for the jam was \"On The Edge\", which goes quite well with my tiles wrapping around on the map (like the castle is on the edge of a magic thing, and that makes stuff wrap around when they get thrown off from the edge).</p>\n<p>Your goal is to move mirrors around to hit every single crystal on the map with the laser.</p>\n<p>Completing a level will give you one, two, or three stars. The less steps it takes you to complete a level, the more stars you get!</p>\n<p>Once you collect enough stars, you can face the final challenge of the game... the <strong>boss</strong> level... This level is insane, and I highly recommend either not completing it, or using drawings to plan out what you have to do.<br/>If you do successfully complete the level, then please send me a screenshot of how many steps it took you\u00a0<strong><em>without the solution of the level</em></strong>. I want to keep this a secret for anyone who hasn't completed it yet.</p>\n<p>Have fun and good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Shifting a line doesn't feel as satisfiying as it should be. I just had no time to make this work out any better.</li><li>No auido. There is just no music or sounds what so ever. This was intentional cuz I don't know how to do any of that stuff, and I didn't want to download anything from the internet.</li><li>Fullscreen is buggy. I didn't have time to fully work the fullscreen out. The background is half missing when you put your game into fullscreen. The gameplay doesn't change, but it's still not the type of fullscreen you probably expected.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/0046cc1a93f9cb824bbc7144509c5f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pampogokiraly"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
