Of course, I had to\u00a0simplify it a bit, but the base concept is still here. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did when making\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>Notice for rebind players:</p>\n<p>The following controls will need to be rebound, as well as normal fangame controls:</p>\n<p>A/S: Swap Bullet Type</p>\n<p>Down: Crouch</p>\n<p>Up: Open Doors, Read Signs</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>Music: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_LBbuAykAxYRmVaVb20u0z_SEhnNRyZ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897f1e2a50a27cb843a83e8fc8e65450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["p00ks"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
