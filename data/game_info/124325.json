{"id": 124325, "slug": "brottas-land", "name": "Brottas Land!", "name_original": "Brottas Land!", "description": "<p>Brottas Land is a Game Boy inspired game first released on December 24th, 2013. It is a small-scale, run 'n' jump platformer and my first real foray into the game design field.</p><p>The story centers around Fatso Brotta, beloved children's entertainer and \"son of prophecy\", tasked by the Gods above to discover the source of -and put an end to- a horrible bug infestation plaguing the Maidist Homeland.</p><p>Aisde from running from left to right and avoiding pits, the player is also able to find \"Potates\" (Maidist currency), and stomp on the horrible bugs to increase their score. Different things award you with different numbers of points, but death takes all those points away!</p><p>(I must be honest I have never seen a Perfect Score before!*HINT HINT*)</p><p>In this updated version of the original game, a variety of changes have been made, including slight changes to the level layouts to make them more playable, the change of the jump button from Ctrl to Z, a change in palette to make interactable objects and and other parts of the stage more clearly defined from one another, and a much improved final boss, since many said the original was too hard.</p><p>This version of Brottas Land is one I can truly call finished and one I can say I am truly proud of. It's a short but sweet game about a man doing his part to make sure the world he lives in is safe for everyone in it!</p><p>So, grab yourself a copy and enjoy! And, if you find that you liked it, stick around! I plan to release many more fun and inventive games in the future.</p><p>--Avery \"G0ATFAC3\" Petrie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef774afc253d73c9e1db7ae14ff08b39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G0ATFAC3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
