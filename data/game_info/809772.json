I made it from scratch using Java and OpenGL. It was never finished, so it will crash and bug out on you. Regardless, it would be a shame not to offer it to the world.</p><p>Stuff that doesn't work:</p><ul><li>Saving and loading</li><li>War between factions</li><li>And there are very very many bugs, many of which will crash your game.</li></ul><p>Also, all developer cheats are still in the game, so try and figure out for yourself what the different buttons on your keyboard do.
