{"id": 4240, "slug": "worms-revolution", "name": "Worms Revolution", "name_original": "Worms Revolution", "description": "<p>Worms Revolution is a Team17 game and the 18th part of Worms series, counting as many as 25 titles total. It is the turn-based game with a heavy accent on customizable characters and environment. The game features single- and multiplayer while giving the players an opportunity to play in cooperative with the hotseat feature allowing them to take turns one at a time.<br />\nIt is hard to say that &quot;Worms&quot; has any plot at all: there is barely even hints, which may prompt the player to understand the eternal conflict between the worms of a different color. <br />\nThe gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons. They do not only damage the other worms but also transform the ground. While every turn grants the player with the ability to walk a certain amount of space and utilize one weapon \u2014 the landscape factor is crucial here.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2012-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T02:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197780c33719b9b2e4d3619a527f3c21.jpg", "website": "http://www.team17.com", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 86, "owned": 2119, "beaten": 79, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 177, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 89, "ratings_count": 260, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 263, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
