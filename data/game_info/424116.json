Please see the FPS table below to get a sense of gameplay smoothness you may experience.<br/><br/><strong>FPS Table</strong><br/><br/><br/>Note 1:<br/>All settings that can drain FPS have been turned on: Anti-aliasing, Bloom, Sun; the most GFX expensive weapons were used as soon as made available (Missiles, Rail Gun, Phaser). This means there is a good chance you will get higher FPS on your machine, and a smaller chance you will get lower FPS, depending on gameplay luck, and of course player weapon preference.<br/><br/>Note 2:<br/>No hardware has been overclocked. All hardware settings are stock / original. All machines have the latest OS update and drivers installed as of the date of testing (March 17, 2020). All tests have been performed on traditional HDDs. No hybrids or SSDs. If you plan to run the game off of an SSD, you may see improved performance.<br/><br/><br/>All things considered, we believe you can run this game on almost any PC with hardware up to 10-15 years old. :)<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/976d6517cf6eca2a07f89424b5f64d8e.jpg", "website": "https://srmgames.com/#games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SRM Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SRM Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
