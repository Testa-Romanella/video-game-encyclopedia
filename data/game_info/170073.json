Attempts to restore it have been obstructed by arson, withdrawn funding, and opposition from the nearby Palace Pier (who claimed \"unfair competition\"). It is now considered to be beyond repair.</p>\n<p>Seagulls flock to the West Pier throughout the year. In December,\u00a0 murmurations of up to 40,000 starlings form across the Brighton coastline, between the West Pier and the Palace Pier. Mussels and barnacles grow on the cast iron gas lanterns under the water. Dolphins have been spotted hunting for fish around the pier's skeleton.<br/></p>\n<p>Learn more about the West Pier from the West Pier Trust.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7d18e9971ba394bef515f14fa0cca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Siobhan Gibson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
