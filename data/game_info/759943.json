The possibilities are endless!\r\n<p>Become a patron to get access to the alpha and other rewards.<br/></p>\n<strong>\ud83e\udd7d </strong>1:1 philosophy\r\n\t<strong>Tinker Pilot</strong> has been designed with 1:1 immersion at its core to achieve the <strong>maximum sense of presence</strong> you can get. In order to achieve this, <strong>your spaceship cockpit can be adapted</strong> to any combination of input methods (HOTAS, VR motion controllers, hand tracking, etc.) to ensure there's no mismatch between what you <em>see </em>and what you <em>feel</em>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\ud83e\ude90 Engaging gameplay\r\n\tThe gameplay in <strong>Tinker Pilot</strong> is meant to be diverse and challenging, but above all is <strong>meant to be <em>fun</em></strong>.\r\n You will be able to play different game modes that will require the use\r\n of the many systems of your ship and the environment itself, where the \r\n\t<strong>proximity </strong>to terrain, stations, ships, and other objects gives a<strong> greater sense of movement and speed</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>\ud83d\udee0 Cockpit customization</strong>\r\n\tWhether you want a layout that adapts to your piloting style, a virtual\r\n representation of your real devices or just some decoration, the\r\n\t<strong> in-game cockpit editor</strong> has you covered. Anything inside your cockpit can be <strong>placed, scaled and animated to your liking</strong>, and you can even<strong> import your own models</strong> and easily integrate them into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\ud83d\udef8 Exhaustive ship systems\r\n\tEvery ship system in the game is designed as an <strong>interface </strong>with a series of actions and data that can be accessed by any element of your customized cockpit. This allows you\r\n to interact and tinker with your ship and all of its different systems \r\nin many different ways, and you can use from the most basic to the most \r\nadvanced controls to \r\n\t<strong>make your piloting as complex as you like</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tDon't forget to join our Discord community and follow us on Twitter for the latest project updates, and subscribe to our mailing list at www.tinkerpilot.com so you don't miss any important announcements!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThank you!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec99b6a60099f9a721cb6b663b222439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lluisgl7"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
