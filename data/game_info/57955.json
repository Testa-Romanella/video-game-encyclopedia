It was released on December 22, 1999 in Japan and on August 29, 2000 in North America. Inspired by Norse mythology, Valkyrie Profile follows the titular valkyrie, Lenneth, as she travels through Midgard, collecting the souls of slain heroes to serve either as einherjar or her personal companions for Ragnarok - the battle to decide the fate of all creation - and trains them by fighting monsters and performing additional quests. As she journeys, she learns more about her original human life, removed from her memory upon becoming a Valkyrie.<br />\nThe game was both a commercial and critical success; it sold over 700,000 copies, and critics praised the deep and complicated gameplay system and the plot. Valkyrie Profile sparked an enhanced port of the game, which was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006 under the name Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. It also led to two other games in the Valkyrie Profile series: a 2006 PlayStation 2 prequel, titled Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria, released in 2006 in Japan and North America and 2007 in Europe, and another prequel titled Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008, March 17, 2009 in North America and on April 3, 2009 in all PAL regions.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "1999-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-29T13:42:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/88f/88f5e91b47277922c418bc769ad2959f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.35, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 21, "beaten": 30, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 40, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 40, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Android", "iOS", "PSP"], "developers": ["Tose", "Tri-Ace"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
