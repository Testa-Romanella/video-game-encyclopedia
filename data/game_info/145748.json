The player gets so annoyed with industry buzzwords such as \"Cross-media decentralization\" and \"Blockchain\", it\u2019s now their destiny to make huge profits, while completely destroying the value of the currency itself.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Use malware to slow down/destroy mining GPUs and incrementally change the selling price of Boinc in the public market. Hoard Boinc in your own private wallet and completely move large chunks of the economy out of circulation.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The Good\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>The amount of      game I created. There is a surprising amount of content in the game, with      individual 'agents' that make purchases and transactions in the currency.\r\n</li><li>The      somewhat-advanced AI. The game features AI that rapidly adapts to the      conditions of the market, such as buying low and selling high. I spent a      lot of the 48 hours given working on fine tuning this AI.\r\n</li><li>The      surprising amount of strategy. Given the 48-hour time limit, I was      definitely not expecting to develop the next Civilization game, but the      strategy in the final jam build is surprising complex. There are 2      independent markets in the game, each with different risks and rewards. Do      you sell in market 1 or market 2? Will the value of Boinc in market 2 rise      tomorrow? Is this $100 per coin gamble worth it?\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The Bad\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Its missing      super basic things. You cannot close the game without alt-F4 or task      manager. Also, there is no way to pause the game.\r\n</li><li>The game      takes place over only 30 in game days and the daily timer is WAY too short.      I was considering changing this after the jam, being only 2 variables to      change, but I decided not to for the sake of preservation.\r\n</li><li>There is no      end. I didn't have time to add a \"You Win/Lose\" screen, there\u2019s      only a console printout\r\n</li><li>Programmer      Art. Work with what you have.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Recommended way to play\r\n  </p>\n<ol><li>Set a      personal day goal. I would recommend 90 days.\r\n</li><li>Spend the      first few minutes looking over the story and menus to get a good feel for      them. Restart the game from scratch for the real attempt.\r\n</li><li>Fullscreen at      1920x1080 (Full HD) resolution.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e947060830cfc7256059e8c299c039b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shuttah627"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
