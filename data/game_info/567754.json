Simulator (CLS) is an educational game that simulates a chemistry lab with all the necessary elements to carry out experiments and practical exercises in a playful environment.<br/>The game consists of presenting challenges to the player who can try to solve them with their knowledge or try a step by step of resolution in order to study the presented challenge.<br/><br/>CLS also gives players challenges and allows them to use elements normally used in real laboratories in mini-games that will represent different processes, such as state change, mixing, separating mixtures of different shapes, chemical balances, among many others, all in a dynamic and fun way.<br/><br/>The android version is quite old but shows part of the ideas we had for the game/simulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d678ba83feac96177db3bd42a405a8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Douzane"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
