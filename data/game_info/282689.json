Meet your Teacher's every demand by mixing the proper ingredients in the cauldron, and conjure the right stuff. Only one catch- you don't know what any of the ingredients do, and you never will! The ingredients change purpose every match, meaning that each game is a new challenge for you and your opponent. Figure out what each one does, and summon what teacher wants before your opponent can! Play with two controllers, or share a keyboard with WASD, Arrow Keys, and both CTRL keys.</p>\n<p>Made by John Guerra, Dillon DeSimone, and Tom\u00a0Farro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1571610fd91dc546ad87bad694209366.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["We Need Bees"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
