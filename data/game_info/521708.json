{"id": 521708, "slug": "apotheker", "name": "Apotheker", "name_original": "Apotheker", "description": "Apotheker is a story-driven logic puzzle game where you must learn the delicate art of potion-brewing through thoughtful use of ingredients, tools, and funds. Use your resources in the most efficient way possible to maximize your profits for every potion - alternatively, what exactly would happen if you gave fermented slugs and cigarette ashes to help soothe a baby? Science is all about experimentation, after all!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Add ingredients to your cauldron to change the effects of your creation. One may never be enough - every addition comes with unintended effects that must be balanced. But remember, the more you add, the more unstable your mixture becomes!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use the tools at your disposal to modify your ingredients to better suit your needs. Sure, you could just add that mighty banana, but wouldn't it be more useful if you fermented it, diluted it, or blended it to draw out it's power? Each ingredient can offer endless possibilities, so be sure to get your money's worth!<br/><br/><br/><br/>As your popularity grows, you'll see many new faces come into your shop, all of which having different intentions for your potions - will you sympathize with the downtrodden, or brew for the highest bidder? Who will you support when violence is tearing the city apart? Will you keep your head down, or stand up for what's right?<h3>Features</h3><br/><strong><ul><li>Single player story campaign with Experiment, Efficiency, and Expert modes<br/></li><li>Unique NPC clientele that you can befriend or betray - branching narrative choices resulting in multiple endings<br/></li><li>120+ potion puzzles to solve, each with infinite solutions<br/></li><li>Upgrade your potion-making arsenal by unlocking tools that open new puzzle solving doors<br/></li><li>Complete original soundtrack - low-fi fantasy beats to brew potions to!</li></ul></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T02:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93dd817e3aa7bf1b2c6d03773ed54f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pine Drake Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pine Drake Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
