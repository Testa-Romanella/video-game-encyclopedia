As you explore you find scrawled messages and strange puzzles you must solve to progress, all while a tug on your chest makes you fear what happens in the corner of your eye.</p>\n<p>Heavily based on the Backrooms concept, step into level 0 with puzzles and something watching as you try to piece together the clues.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left-Click - Interact</p>\n<p>E - Inventory</p>\n<p>M - Map</p>\n<p>LShift - Sprint</p>\n<p>ESC - Pause</p>\r\nAdvice:\r\n<p><strong>This game was made with\u00a01920 x 1080 screen size in mind. If you are having trouble clicking on the watch buttons please download the second version.</strong></p>\n<p>Because this is a puzzle game with many messages and clues, it would be best if you had a way to take notes either digital or physical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you feel like you can't find an answer check the MANUAL in the PAUSE menu. These may tell you the answers so only use them if you need it.</p>\r\nPost mortem:\r\n<p>What went right?</p>\n<p>There were many things that when right but the ones we want to focus on are the player and puzzle mechanics. We are able to implement an inventory that lets the player take notes and objects to view at any time. We are also proud of the sprint mechanic that drains a stamina bar and when it runs out you have to wait for it to fully recharge. For the puzzles, we were able to have working and custom combination\u00a0locks that open if the answer is inputted.</p>\n<p>What went wrong/what problems did you face?</p>\n<p>For the most part, the main problems were the number of members and Unity changing their collaboration. Our team has 6 members which meant it was difficult to separate the work among all of us. The other problem was that very close to the deadline the collaboration feature was disabled by Unity to force Plastic SCM.</p>\n<p>How did you overcome those problems?</p>\n<p>We overcame the issue with the about of members by assigning specialization between members. Some major roles were audio designer, puzzles and player maker, AI creations, and UI design. With the Plastic\u00a0SM issue, we sent the new files to one member that would implement the new work into their version.</p>\n<p>What changes were made and why?</p>\n<p>Besides the changes made to overcome the issues, we made little change. Some UI changes and changing messages on the wall to notes so the player had access to them at all times.</p>\n<p>What did you learn?</p>\n<p>We learned a lot about how Unity operates like how collides can block other collides from being clicked. How to create an inventory and pause menu with multiple menus.\u00a0Other things were how to animate and implement cutscenes to Unity.\u00a0</p>\r\nConcept Art:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02d21c3627dec25d21f4cf2b5c1da963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CompSciBoi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
