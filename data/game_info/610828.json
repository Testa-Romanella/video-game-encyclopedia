If you see from the game photo, maybe you are asking \"what's the word TES?\" yes, because it started when I learned to use a special unity to make Android at first I was confused about how to do it. but after I learned 1 - 4 days I finally understood it quite well. After that, I tried to make an Android game with a rolling theme. Yes, it's just like a normal game. Rolling-themed games are balls, but for me, I want to make something</p>\n<p>different, that's where my Roll The ball game started. that's where the first version of the Roll the ball Game was made. Not much in the first version of this game, it's just a place and a ball and of course the joystick. then evolved again to version 2 I tried to think what was missing. And finally I found it was better if I made the game character not a ball but a capsule and then I turned the level into a maze. as a result the game is the second version</p>\n<p>and the file I gave you is version 2. Actually there is version 3 but I haven't had time to export it yet. that's the story of the beginning of the roll the ball game</p>\n\n<p>what's in this game?</p>\n<p>\u00a0so the contents are simple. joysticks, mazes, and capsules are simple and easy. And of course the capsule must have a goal and I give it the goal of collecting all the coins in the maze.</p><p>Credit:</p><p>- Make with Unity</p><p>-\u00a0Music By Kevin Macleod</p><p>- Maze By Styanton</p><p>- Joystick By Fenerax Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd805921bd9b75172c4672eca736dc59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DCGame"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
