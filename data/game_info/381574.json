As the main character, you get to move to a Caribbean island named Santa Locura, working the summer away in a bar named <em>The Inqueersition</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>Your day to day routine gets derailed by the\u00a0men you meet, all of them hiding a dealbreaker in their closet. What IS their deal? WHY is it so hard to find a proper man? Do you even NEED a man?</p>\n<p>...well, this is a dating sim, so we\u2019ll go with \u201cyes\u201d.</p>\n<p>You will get to interact with your friends, coworkers and possible love interests in a variety of ways. Will you manage to land the man of your dreams and love him despite the issues they might have, or will they chew you up and spit you like gum?</p>\n<p><strong>MAIN LEAD:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MAX:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Max just moved to the island looking for a chance at a fresh start. He has NO idea what\u2019s in store for him. But he\u2019s young, he\u2019s cute,and life usually works out just fine for those kind of people.</p>\n<p>Unless they make the wrong choice every.
