There are no notes you are expected to play, and no audience waiting to \"boo\" you for a bad performance.  Instead, find yourself surrounded by a plethora of different instruments, from drum set, to harp, to theremin, to timpani drums.<br/>You'll also find an intuitive touch based sequencer to add full band orchestration with a few touches of a few buttons.   Relax in a beautiful meadow and play around on a lovely harp, or rain destruction from the skies as the drumming God of Thunder!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f62171efc76de1d5a23ad1bfe779ca47.jpg", "website": "http://www.prismicstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prismic Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Prismic Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
