And that word is Jim!<br/><br/>Let us carefully examine the life of Jim through the venerable medium known as the VISUAL NOVEL. A visual novel is like a traditional novel in digital form that has music, sounds and pictures. Pictures!!! The player progresses through the story by simply clicking the mouse and revealing subsequent text. In the game, much like in real life right now, some limited interactions are allowed. <br/><br/>The human player can make decisions at certain points in the story and choose one path over another. Just like real life, where one can choose to ignore or heed the parable of Jim. Would you like to know more?<h3>Story</h3><br/><br/>This is the heartwarming story of Booth Preacher Jim, the Man of Sterling Quality.<br/><br/>Jim is a tremendous man who is big and strong and manly. Everyone knows it, even if his critics pretend otherwise. To be completely honest, they are all just jealous and have much wickedness in their evil hearts because they are nowhere near as masculine as Jim. Their small petty minds cannot comprehend Jim's huge heart that is always ready to help people, whether they want it or not. <br/><br/>His booth always appears where it is most needed. Unsuspecting pedestrians and commuters alike benefit from Jim's wise counsel as he screams unspecified sermons at them with a vociferous virile voice. <br/><br/>But his noble routine has been disrupted. An ancient Steam Greenlight game has finally been released from the depths of Early Access and now runs rampant throughout the internet. Anyone unfortunate enough to play 'Death Simulator' will summon forth the mysterious Evil Ghost in seven days... Unfortunately for Evil Ghost, her womanly ways will prove insufficient to overcome the mighty male maestro that is Jim.<h3>Features</h3><br/><br/><ul><li>Mostly linear story with very limited branching paths<br/></li><li>Most standard Ren'Py functions (save, load, skip, scroll text, hide text, history)<br/></li><li>A relatively large number of custom art of unspecified taste<br/></li><li>Basic sounds and music whose volume can be adjusted<br/></li><li>Estimated reading time: 40 to 60 minutes</li></ul><h3>Contains</h3><br/><br/><ul><li>Real humans.<br/></li><li>Natural human conversations. <br/></li><li>Masculine Dominance. <br/></li><li>Strong male protagonist.
