Survival has led to small alliances that may last only as long as it takes to smoke a cigar.<br/><br/>There are three modes that allow you to play either in single player or with friends cooperatively or against each other facing waves of tanks via three modes of play:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Survival</strong>: cooperatively in teams or as an individual in single player . Players must survive waves of tanks, until time runs out, you die, or you reach the required number of points.<br/></li><li><strong>Dungeons</strong>: A team only mode. All players make up a team which must survive several rooms completing various objectives. The game ends when the team reach the end goal or lose all their lives. You can also play this mode in single player agains bots.<br/></li><li><strong>Strategy</strong>: A multiplayer only mode. Where two teams of two to four players defend their bases from the opposing team. The aim is to destroy your opponents base before they destroy yours.

Also, each tank has a default weapon and each weapon has an alternative shoot, it can be another shoot object or another ability. To continue you can see all weapons:<br/><br/><br/><br/>All the weapons you can use them when they appear in the scene during the match. The abilities also appear in the scene, useful when you need one to eliminate the enemies that follow you.
