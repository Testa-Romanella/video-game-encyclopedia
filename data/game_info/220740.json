This App is the official implementation of the original dice game - as a solo-version for Highscore. The App contains German and English rules.<br/><br/>In coordination with the Inventor the number of dice throws has been limited to 25. With this little trick the App has the same wonderful tension and feeling like the original game. The App contains a bonus version \"Unlimited\", which allows even higher results.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T23:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/461214880316796531c1bb49e840ae86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Reinhard Staupe"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
