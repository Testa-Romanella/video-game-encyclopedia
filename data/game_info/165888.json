But little did you know, that by the time you were done, it would be closing time. Now the powers off and everything is out to get you...<br/></p>\n<p>You must find a way out of this crazy store...</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is an old game I made back in May 8th 2017. Please don't think I just made this recently, lol. Strange Terror From Beyond The Stars, my latest game, is coming out very very soon, like most probably this week or the beginning of next week, so stay tuned for that game! It's gonna be great! (I hope)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/902/902060607ff25f96d40f624cd4950871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
