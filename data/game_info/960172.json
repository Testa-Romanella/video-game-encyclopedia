Protect Federation transporters and Federation facilities from incoming attacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Overview:</strong><br/>This game converts an old school 'arcade' gameplay into a modern 3d- gameplay world with extensive building structures. The gameplay focuses on an action-based gaming atmosphere consisting of numerous space-ship dogfights. The player can test his flight skills chasing down enemy ships, when flying above extensive space platforms and big war ships, like cruisers and carriers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>The player fleet has to be managed between the flights, because every mission consumes resources, like munition and fuel. Used ships have to be re-equipped and repaired, new ships can be purchased. While playing different missions the player pilot gathers experience points and credits. Mission results and pilot career are saved to the players local hard drive. Every ship has an arsenal of weapons, like guns, lasers, ion-guns against shields, rockets and torpedos against bigger war ships. Bigger ships and stations are equipped with different types of gun turrets, controller units, bridge, freight and resources like containers, fuel tanks and other stuff. <br/><br/><strong>User Interface:</strong><br/>The space ship can easily by flown with pc-keyboard  in different fly modes.
