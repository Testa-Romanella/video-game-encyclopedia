You can feel it, the end is growing near. In a last ditch effort, you travel to\u00a0 the ruins of a long forgotten temple in search of a way, any way of prolonging your life.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>An RPG with one meter, life-force. The curse slowly drains this over time, attacking uses life-force too. Find artifacts to boost your power and keep you alive until you can discover a way to cure the curse.\u00a0</p><p>Artifacts Include:</p><ul><li>\"Gauntlets of less-is-more\" - gain additional damage while close to death.</li><li>\"Boots of less-is-more\" - gain additional speed while close to death but slow down while farther from death.</li><li>\"Necklace of Vampirism\" - kill enemies with it equipped\u00a0\u00a0to steal their life force.</li><li>\"Cloak of Life Siphoning\" - while close to enemies,\u00a0drain them\u00a0of their life-force.</li><li>\"Belt of Stabilization\" - slow the spread of the curse by 50%, all attacks cost 50% less life-force.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made in 1 week for the BlackThornProd Game Jam #3 with the theme of \"less is more\". In the game, this manifests in multiple ways, the life-force is the only meter to pay attention to. Several artifacts such as the \"boots of less-is-more\" will increase the speed of the character based on the player's life force, but has the adverse effect of slowing them down when life-force is to large.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, game design, and animation\u00a0by IanGoGo</p>\n<p>Music by:\u00a0Nicolas Jeudy and\u00a0DARK FANTASY STUDIO (Pre-made and pre-purchased)</p>\n<p>Art: Kenny 1-bit with modifications<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed34b50e9246cbf1821e6b30fc80fe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IanGoGo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
