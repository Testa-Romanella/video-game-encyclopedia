Collect the orbs and power ups to advance to the next level. Each level is randomly generated. The AI admittedly is not over advance so just have fun with it. You have 3 lives and each new level gain a life. I have set it to 10 levels so you can have 10 play throughs. Have fun and thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cd2291649769e7baefa892e064cb1b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["sevrc1136"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
