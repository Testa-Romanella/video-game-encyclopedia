Each racing pod is designed to gradually increase in speed as our contestants vie to be the fastest on the track. But beware, as things heat up it gets harder to avoid crashing into your competitors! Be sure to check your rear viewscreen as well, as someone even faster than you could blaze by in the blink of an eye - or smash right into you, obliterating any chance at victory.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>Fully synthesized dynamic audio</li>\n<li>High-speed drifting and collisions</li>\n<li>Screen reader accessibility</li>\n</ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Audo is an audio game best experienced with headphones.
