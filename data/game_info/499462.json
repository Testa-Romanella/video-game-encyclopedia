That's the premise of Takashi Latton, an RPG in the Fabula universe, the planet of controllers of the twelve elements of nature.</p>\n<p>The project is my first game, but ambitions go beyond. Takashi Latton is an introduction of a saga that will be called Fantastic World of Fabula, with at least five more editions planned. In the context of this game, there are twelve elements and twelve kingdoms where their respective controllers habit. The controllers can use their powers to maintain the city, take care of citizens or for battle.</p>\n<p>Those who chose to be a warrior can pick between six classes to fight. The history follows Takashi, who chose the path of the samurai and is a controller from the fire kingdom.</p>\n<p>Social media:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/LattonTakashi</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/Takashi-Latton-101634305029534</p>\n<p>@takashilatton Instagram</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8bf247f5d578e72d263814345fc4722.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4E Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
