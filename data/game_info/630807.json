All your life, you\u2019ve watched everyone around you fall in love. Your best friend, Suzu, has been pining after another student for years. Your other best friend, Yuki, had a girlfriend for a few years, although they broke up last year. Even your brother has a girlfriend, and he\u2019s in middle school.<br/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as though you\u2019ve never had feelings for someone\u2014 you definitely have, they\u2019ve just never been returned. As much as it pains you, it\u2019s quite possible you just weren\u2019t meant to find someone who cares about you. Sure, your friends are great, and it\u2019s clear they want the best for you, but from what you\u2019ve heard, none of that will ever match up to the beautiful experience of being loved.\r\n</p>\n<p>So\u2026 here you are. Going through the motions. Hoping against all hope that you\u2019ll find someone to finally, finally love you. At this point, though, it would probably take a miracle.\r\n</p>\n<p>---\r\n</p>\n<p>This is just a demo of this game! Apologies for any issues with it, I made this for the Bingo Jam and didn\u2019t have too much time to flesh things out! I also don\u2019t have any way to test the Mac build\u00a0 (note:\u00a0it ended up literally just not uploading anyway! oh well!), so\u2026 good luck!\r\n</p><p>Note:\u00a0There's some swearing here and there and one somewhat crude joke but generally not NSFW and probably not offensive to most audiences.</p>\n<p>Bingo Score: Who knows! I tried to get all of them, but I think I missed one or two.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538f5daea1770108500d772e896b3d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["emsolaris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
