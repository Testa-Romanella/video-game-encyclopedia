Super Epicquest is the story of an amnesiac hero, and his buddy Sign Dude. They fight fire breathing pillars, admire beautiful marble dragons, and best of all, make quips at every little inconvenience they happen upon! This is mostly practice for future(?) projects, so I hope you can find at least SOME enjoyment out of this stupid witty duo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f2/0f2d3b9479c2f32f9dc6ff42edf9c631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mendenhall02"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
