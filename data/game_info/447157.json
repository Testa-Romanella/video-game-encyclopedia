Almost every choice has unique dialogue and outcomes.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>No combat or leveling. This might seem strange to put as a \"feature\", but I don't want to misrepresent the experience as a typical RPG, even though I would love to design such mechanics</li></ul><br/><h3>Free Demo</h3><br/>Check out the free demo above for an exclusive ending! I believe demos are great for people to try out an experience and see if it resonates with them without committing to a price point.<h3>Why I made this</h3><br/>Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school 1990s PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment. CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences. <br/><br/>Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very, very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging experience that doesn't have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T02:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c92/c92cc598cfee0e46f91f270179194c1e.jpg", "website": "https://www.shiveringhearts.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Misha C", "Mischa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mischa"], "esrb_rating": null}
