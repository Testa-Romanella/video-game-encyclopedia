There is a short tutorial level showcasing the default controls in the beginning.</p>\n<p>Guide your\u00a0dinos through the levels using the Dino's complementing abilities:</p>\n<p>As \"Yellow Dino\" you can put crates into stasis. If stasis-ed crates are hit with arrows, they will store the impact force. You can shoot multiple arrows at stasis-ed crates and upon releasing the crates from stasis all the forces will be applied simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The \"Red Dino\" can shoot arrows to move crates and spawn balloons to send them afloat.</p>\n<p>Reach the blue flag together to finish a level!</p>\r\nAdditional Information\r\n<p>Designed to be played with two XBOX 360/ONE\u00a0Controller. You will have to rebind controls if you intend on using different controllers. Take a look at this for making any controller act like a XBOX360\u00a0controller:\u00a0https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce#readme<br/></p>\n<p>Game is meant to be played by two persons, but contains the function to swap dinos which allows you to play it on your own - however we highly suggest finding someone to play together. Some levels can not be beaten alone. You can use the Skip button (Select on XBOX by default) to skip (only)\u00a0those.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\r\nDino Sprites and Animationshttps://arks.itch.io/dino-characters<br/>by @ScissorMarksLevel Artby\u00a0@ShackhalStart Screen MusicNh\u00b2<br/>Youtube<br/>https://soundcloud.com/nh-squared<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8dda6f273d75074ca989ac2c7157f3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Htastic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
