That's how these stories go.</p><p>But this dungeon won't let him leave without its prize, and that seems to be everything he has.</p><p><em>As you play, the hero will grow more feeble, which is what sets this game apart, and might also be a insurmountable flaw in its design.</em></p><p><strong>Any feedback about your experience with this prototype is very welcome. </strong>It was a lot of fun to design, and while there are improvements in the design I'd like to still make, I'm finding it difficult imagining how this prototype could be made into a compelling experience (at the moment it seems more traumatizing than compelling).</p><p><strong>This game was created during Pirate Jam 2017. A week long jam in Thailand, largely on boats, hosted by American McGee.</strong> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3f2fdd2f85e46db78a6dafba7623558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CallOfTheVoid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
