It tells the story of children who crashed on an island and have to survive the longer they can until someone finds them. There is no adult with them so they are only on their own, they are free, but they also have to face the responsibilities that go with this freeness.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/664d857d8a88f6113aa63f2ea44dc352.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["L\u00e9onie RICHARD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
