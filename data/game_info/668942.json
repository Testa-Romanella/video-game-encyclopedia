Cyclogons are the curve traced by a point on a polygon that rolls across a straight line. This point is typically a vertex of the shape, but more general points can be considered as well. This game does not feature concave cyclogons despite having concave shapes, since a rolling concave polygon passes through the line as it rolls, but we can't have packages phase through the assembly line! It also doesn't feature prolate cyclogons, which describe a point outside of the rolling polygon, and a floating barcode also violates quite a few laws of physics.,</em> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc53fb46d8070b819b3edc0201f77e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Philosopher's Stone System"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
