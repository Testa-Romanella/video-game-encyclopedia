It is notable for being one of the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.</p>\n<p>Major League Baseball was developed by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on managerial details, which stressed the importance of choosing a well-balanced team. Despite its graphical limitations, it was considered a three-dimensional game at the time and was featured in the first issue of Nintendo Power as compared the system's other baseball games of the era.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/4206186f91f312f5e4d3b30927d8c493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["LJN"], "esrb_rating": null}
