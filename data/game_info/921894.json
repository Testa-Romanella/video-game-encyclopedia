Randomized action through different biomes... Learn each enemy's behavior, come up with tactics, and overcome opposition! Become more and more powerful by using their loot, such as items to spice up the gameplay, or gold to spend and upgrade your stats!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls can be found in-game, but here they are:</p>\r\nAbilityKeyboardControllerMove<br/>ArrowsD-Pad<br/>Left JoystickAttack/AcceptZAInteract/DeclineXXExplosionCR1MenuEscStart\r\n<strong>Read before playing:</strong>\r\nDashing is not only an evasive method, it deals damage too! It's your main way of dealing damage!\r\n<p>Explosion ability deals 5x damage, but also damages the player and stuns them.</p>\n<p>An enemy can drop nothing, gold, or an item. Gold can be exchanged for character growth at the fountain after beating a boss. An item will always spawn after 14 non-item drops.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was designed with controller support in mind. As such, please navigate the interface by using the keys when playing on keyboard, as the mouse might not always work when clicking on buttons.</p>\n<p>If you experience a bad roll at the procedural generation, such as a completely isolated room you can't enter/exit, close the game. Your progress is saved, but not the layout, so you can have another go at the generation.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6b2f60ee861e6adaec506e6e9241a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falcon Nova"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
