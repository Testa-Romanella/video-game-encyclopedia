Dark Monster descended on her village and infected Ana's mother. And now the main character will have to go to the ancient Fortress to find a cure. This Fortress is unexplored and full of dangers.

And legend has it that in this darkness a brave adventurer can find both salvation and death.<br/><h3>Game feature</h3><ul><li> <strong>High complexity</strong><br/>There is no room for the weak in the world of the distant future.
