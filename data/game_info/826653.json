This is the latest project of Badlife Games. We joined the jam three days after it started, so probably the game needs to fix some bugs and details, but we gave all our effort making this, trying to make the best of it possible. Don't forget to leave a comment with feedback, we want to learn more with this experience. See you soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T14:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13f97dbd565b38eb9767782d8a5d034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeoMont", "NOxNE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
