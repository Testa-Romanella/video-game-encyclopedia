Rumors have it that monsters roam the lands after dark and anyone caught outside is never heard from again. With eerie murderous howling heard every night, Phebe has no choice to become accustomed to this new life if she wants to find her missing grandfather.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as this polite city girl as she forages, farms and (possibly)\u00a0 woos the local villagers\u00a0 as she navigates this new life of hers.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Features:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Forage, fish, farm and buy items in order to uncover the mystery of Phebe's missing grandfather.</p>\n<p>2. Romance(?) one of two eligible bachelors in town. (Careful, some might have their own agenda that doesn't line up with Phebe's.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Day/Night cycles that makes use of Unity's 2D lighting to create an eerie environment to explore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>It's just me, Heiden :D</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Roadmap:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an extremely early build of the game! It only features the introduction scenes as well as the intro scenes for the two love interests. Foraging and farming is fully implemented but not polished. Fishing is planned but not currently in game.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In order for your plants to grow you have to click the plot\u00a0once per day after you have planted something! In the full version this will turn the soil darker to indicate that you watered it.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0And as for the dev cycle for this one: I\u00a0won't be able to work on this title from April to May (I AM SO TIRED PLEASE LET ME REST *SOBS*) but will be returning to full development on this title in June.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>What I am looking for in regards to feedback for this early demo:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Thoughts on the characters so far?</p>\n<p>2. Typos?\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Which of the two LIs are you most interested in?\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. Would you be interested in being a beta tester for the finished game?</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Eventually I plan on building a much bigger farming sim game (think Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley) but am currently building up the multiple types of systems I want to implement in these smaller games.</p>\n<p>A Heart of Butterblue will be free and has a (current finished but unedited ) script with a word count of 20k. There are two endings, with one being a much longer true ending.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hoped to have a finished game submitted for nano this year but am proud of what I was able to accomplish, regardless. I hope you enjoy this sneak peek of what I'm working on and will wait for the finished version.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much!\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Heiden.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T23:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d953e456be8329ffa6bf9693f232e75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Heiden"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
