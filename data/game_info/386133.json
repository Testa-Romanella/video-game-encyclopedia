A miserable failure, the website was quickly scrubbed from the mentos\u00ae website and was never mentioned again. Recently a copy of it turned up on a CD-ROM among the possessions of the late Mr Guy Dupr\u00e9. He was believed to be 82 at time of passing and was survived by no immediate family.</p>\n<p>The restored website is shown above.</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Shadowlands 7 - Codex Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T06:44:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db1059372c0eb38f645349342a8ab56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marek Kapolka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
