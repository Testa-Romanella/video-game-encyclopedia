It's all or nothing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to showcase that mindset from the perspective of a gay trucker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T11:46:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58dd17f378b54a8a1ccae30095fb0883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["annualOatmeal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
