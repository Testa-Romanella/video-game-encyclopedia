I've always wanted to make something in the style of the id Software titles of the 90's - a special time in gaming for me.</p>\n<p>Much like the id Software titles - Nightmare Prism has a very basic story. Data-Dyne Technologies (HQ is in an old castle with advanced laboratories beneath) have researched and, to a degree of success, managed to build their own teleportation systems. Teleportation is finally possible, but powered through a Crystal Prism. The downside? The Crystal Prism has some kind of demonic force attached to it: Not only does the Prism give the teleport pads the unique power they need to operate, but it also provides a gateway for vile, blood thirsty creatures to cross from their world into ours.</p>\n<p>All the scientists and researchers are dead, blah blah, you're the one marine left who can save the day!</p>\n<p>This is a 3-level game featuring a number of monsters, two hand-made weapons and an awesome soundtrack - music all available via the public domain! Sounds came from sound packs, individual royalty free sources and hand made clips.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b59aa9b0515423957c0e63997069212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElkCloner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
