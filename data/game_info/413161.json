On top of that, the golf course is swinging.\r\n\r\nIf you touch the blue hologram, you get points. Be aware that you lose points if the ball falls into the holes.\r\nYou can also jump, which is very useful to avoid the dangerous holes.\r\nIf your score is high enough you get some cups which are very useless but nice to own :) \r\n\r\nThere are more or less useful items spread over the golf course.\r\n<strong>Camera:</strong> swap the view. Try it out. Its funny :D<strong>Spring:</strong> gives you 5 very useful jumps<strong>Lock:</strong> closes all the annoying holes<strong>Clock:</strong> gives you a few seconds more to grind<strong>Arrows: </strong>stops the waves for a short momentBEST ITEM IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nif (game.isFun)\r\n    sendMessage(\"Nice game\") //Thanks :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bb0b50b3b43870cf6d8019815bd4f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["devmarcstorm", "Matti-Schwartz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
