It's hard to notice, but I timed it that way in the Unity editor.<br/><br/> I tried to make this casual enough to fit into your lunch break. If you don't lose before that, each level is the length of one song, so about 2-3 minutes per round.<br/></p>\n<p>This should be easy to get going. But it'll be challenging to finish the level and I dare you to top my highscore (402400).<br/></p>\n<p>My new link-gun mechanic allows you to balance between an increased score multiplier and the risk of keeping more enemies alive. More risk means more rewards, so the only way to get a good score is to play with maximum difficulty.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD + Arrow Keys + Space</p>\n<p>or use any gamepad with two sticks and a bumper trigger</p>\n\r\nHigher Resolution\r\n<p>There's a Windows version you can download for better graphics.<br/></p>\n\r\nLeaderboards\r\n<p>FYI, the itch.io version is free, but it doesn't have a server for online rankings. There's also a $1 Steam version that uses the Steam leaderboards. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1103870/Space_Dance/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0bfaa9d6c817b4f0812e79f44d53966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["fxtentacle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
