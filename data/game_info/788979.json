The player will then need to remove, replace, set behaviors or ignore the items in order to make the home more energy efficient and have an energy efficiency rating of the Scottish average. They must do this within the time limit of the level which will change based on the level type and difficulty. Power Popper will have four levels that the player can choose from, a studio flat, a flat, a\u00a0maisonette\u00a0and a house. Each level will have a different number of rooms and will have three different level tiers that will unlock after the player has completed the previous tier.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game will feature a cartoon art style in line with games such as candy crush or\u00a0homescapes.
