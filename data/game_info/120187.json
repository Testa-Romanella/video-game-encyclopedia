Adept in the Magic Arts, Terry traversed the lands, explored wondrous caves with treasure, and hunted down ghosts with the Power of Lighting. The land was in a new Golden Age, thanks to Terry's treasure hunting skills, and with shinning brilliance, came deep shadows. A Necromancer by the name of Gurthrain has seized an army of ghosts to attack the kingdom. Now it is up to Terry to find Gurthrain and defeat him and his ghost army to save the kingdom... perhaps with a little gold for him too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84268630a0abf5b78108ca9149ca7a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tiny Country Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
