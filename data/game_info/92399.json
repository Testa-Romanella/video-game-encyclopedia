Our tree. She flew headlong a few hundred yards, landing on a flat stone. I tumbled into high grass. The shadow moved towards my beloved one and soon consumed her. Another flash appeared. This time the brightness blinded me totally but I could imagine the scene in front of me. I've heard the story so many times. Now it was finally happening. The curse was upon us. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tI swore I'd help her shed her serpentine skin and return her to her natural form, no matter what. I turned to the archmage and humbly asked to be able to wield a sword and wear armour. The price for his aid would be the very same item that I was now about to risk my life to obtain. The vessel of restoration. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIron clad and with death in my grip I ventured into the dark to find the goblet of gold.\r\n\t</em> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>** KNIGHT 'N' GRAIL FEATURES **</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Commodore 64 disk-only release! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Special power-ups for your Knight! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Over 200 beautifully crafted screens! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Multiple weapons and armour! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Loads of varied monsters to vanquish! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Huge boss encounters! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 Immersive in-game music and sound effects! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 End Sequence featuring stunning bitmap screens by Archmage! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\u00b7 PAL \r\n\tand NTSC compatible!\u00a0</p><p>.D64 contains full bonus game <strong>FAIRY WELL</strong> from the creators of Knight 'n' Grail!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>** KNIGHT 'N' GRAIL GAME CREDITS **</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tDesign, Graphics and Programming &amp; SFX by\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Mikael Tillander</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAdditional Graphics &amp; Cover Artwork by\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>H\u00e5kon 'Archmage' Repstad</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tMusic by\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Hans Axelsson</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tGame map &amp; packaging by<br/>\n<strong>Jason 'Kenz' Mackenzie</strong>\u00a0</p><p>Updated Game Manual by\u00a0<br/><strong>Andy 'Retrofreak90' Haywood\u00a0</strong></p><p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Knight 'n' Grail</strong> is a game for the Commodore 64.
