I didn't get a chance to flesh it out, so it's very short, but I feel like it says what it needs to say.</p><p>The original plan for the game had a lot more to say, and a good ending that allows you to release the prisoner. But alas, free Construct 2 has a limit on the amount of content that can go into a game. The original flowchart for the game was 2 pages long. This game shows about half a page of it.</p><p>Note: This game is the most popular out of all of the games I've made. I'd like you to know that it was the easiest to make and only took about a week. I am very salty about that.</p><p>Leave a comment if you actually enjoyed it. I have no idea why this game gets so many views. It really baffles me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e87b8f157f278881cbe10d08e99c2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DefinitelyNotAShark"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
