{"id": 638695, "slug": "dirty-beastly-muscles", "name": "Dirty Beastly Muscles", "name_original": "Dirty Beastly Muscles", "description": "<p>Gay. Furry. Muscles. Adult. Full with raunchy plots and grand schemes.<br />\nMuscle beasts live under the control of muscle plants, forced to work and produce for their plant masters. However, this was not always the case. Train, fight, and mingle with your muscle beasts to find out how the world comes to be, and how to break out of the current situation. There are even grander explanations too that explains this new, strange, and hyper masculine world. All is awaiting for you to discover.<br />\nThe game centers on RPG, character customizations, tactical combat, mini-games, puzzle solving, and resource collection/management. Lots and lots of stories can be discovered through character interactions, eventually leading to multiple endings based on player choices. Plenty of nudity and sex to go around, along with raunchy plots that caters to all types of kinks. 16 different selectable characters, each with their own outfits, accessories, skills, story lines, and interactions with others. Are you going to grow all these characters and shed light upon the truth of the world through their interweaving stories? Or are you going to focus on a few favorite characters and bring them to max level first? Do you prefer to collect resources through combat or through puzzles? How about collecting resources through steamy interactions as much as possible? It is all up to the player to decide.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-28T11:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b7/0b795faccbdd25300cb4b24b5d419a13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "esrb_rating": null}
