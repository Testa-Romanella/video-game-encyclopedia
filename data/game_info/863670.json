{"id": 863670, "slug": "spacezoom", "name": "SpaceZoom", "name_original": "SpaceZoom", "description": "<p>Our project is a game where you are presented with a set of levels. These levels consist of an image from JWST, and a zoom point(s). The player can interact with this zoom point(s) and learn information about that region of the image, which represents just one small fraction of our universe. Once the player has gone through the information, they can take a miniature quiz that will test their knowledge of the information presented in this section. After this is completed, if the player gains enough points they proceed to the next level, where they are presented with new images and information. We decided to use the game engine Unity, and our language of choice was C# since we have the most experience with it. Considering that our intended audience are students around our age, ranging from middle school to high school, our goal was to make the game engaging and exciting, in order to retain their attention as much as possible. Once they are finished with all the levels, their total score will be shown, allowing them to compete with friends or test their knowledge and see if they can manage to get a perfect score. This way entertainment and education are combined in such a way that learning about the JWST becomes fun. We hope that our game, with some extra development will assist us in educating the newer generation on the wonders of space research, and interest them in pursuing this as a future career.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:57:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mmartomac"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
