Theme was : \"<strong><em>Delay the Inevitable</em></strong>\".\u00a0In this game, you try to survive a clock that goes faster and faster while horde of enemies are surrounding you. Also, if you don\u2019t knock out the enemies off the arena by <strong>dashing</strong> on them, you will<strong> lose control</strong> of your dash, which will be a big problem to handle !\r\n</p>\n<p>(Warning : You also lose life by touching the boundaries of the clock)\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted the player to lose control of his character and the world around him so he would inevitably die. But you can try to delay your own death. <strong>Thanks to people that will try this game and give feedbacks</strong> !</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T11:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73de30541b7074197ff46c173c946b33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shin0nome"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
