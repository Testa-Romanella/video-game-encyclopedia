In my quest to stop mankind from being submit. Modified to become a cyborg by the Dictator, I caused a lot of harm either in the present or past with my ability to teleport in space and time.

You will have to use your different time manipulation powers to better prepare for your massacre. However, be careful to study the movements of your enemies because they will leave you no chances and your teleportation will be limited. To help you a timeline will be present in the level it will allow you to find your way in your killing.</p>\n<p>During the second phase we take action! Your goal will be to eliminate all of your enemies by running awesome combos. You will not have the right to be careful.</p>\n<p><strong>Features :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A unique Action/Startegy games with gameplay phases\u00a0</li><li>Amazing 2D animations and awesome combos</li><li>A 2.5D game in a beautiful pixel cyberpunk universe</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Prototype :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>One Shot was designed by a group of 7 students from IIM in master 1. In addition, we were fortunate to be able to work with 3 SoundDesigner from the audio workshop school.\u00a0We had 6 months to put in place the most worked pre-production possible. Each month being punctuated by gates where we presented our games to a jury.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the game we would like to bring more diversity in the levels.

If possible add a local multiplayer mode to face these friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits </strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Maxime Giuggia - Producer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Matthieu Guez - Producer</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Mathieu Way-</strong>Programmer</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Pierrick Maczkowiak-\u00a0</strong><strong>Programmer</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Alexandre Framezelle-\u00a0</strong><strong>Artist/Sound Designer</strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Victor Mauduy- Artist</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jer\u00f4me Bonnet- Game Designer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Audio Workshop :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pierre Galibert - Lead Sound Designer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Brice Berrier - Sound Designer\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Valentin Brousse - Sound Designer</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/504d819d451d75bbbfcd9b8f0554bc33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lightning Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
