In a land called Degravis, five Gods known as Divines were killed in a cataclysmic event, and the uncontained remnants of their power has been unleashed upon the land, corrupting specific regions with the primordial aspect of each Divine. The player explores this land in a 3D overworld, building up a deck consisting of cards found through exploration\u00a0to battle with the monstrous inhabitants in turn-based combat. Their objective is to find the corpse of each Divine and extract a part of their essence to form the Godsoul, a magical object that allows the one who possesses it to ascend to Godhood themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat and Controls</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cards in the player's Hand are dragged into the Combo Line, where<strong>\u00a0</strong>they will be played one after the other in the order that you placed them in. Each of the player's turns alternates between Attacking and Defending. When the player is Attacking, you may play any number of Cards with cost equal to\u00a0 your current Mana, while the enemy plays cards in defence. When the player is Defending, they cannot play more cards than the enemy has played that turn, so their objective is to mitigate as much oncoming damage as possible.\u00a0You start Combat with 6 Mana, but regain all spent mana and earn one extra at the start of each of your turns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player's deck consists of two types of cards: Spell cards and Monster cards. Spell cards have powerful, single-use effects that disappear from the player's hand after being played, while Monster cards act as minions who can be summoned multiple times, simultaneously protecting the player from damage while attacking the enemy. Your Monster cards have a specific amount of Attack and Health. When you place them in front of an attacking enemy in a round of Combat, they deal their attack damage to said enemy and\u00a0take damage in return equal to the enemy's attack value, before returning\u00a0to the player's hand with their health depleted by however much they just lost. If you do not place any Monster in front of an attacking enemy, you lose health equal to their attack value.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both Spell cards and Monster cards are split into five types, those being the domain of each God. Cards from each Domain have specific bonus abilities and elemental damage types to exploit enemy weaknesses and spice up Combat. For example, Fire damage is extra effective against Shadow enemies, while Ocean damage is extra effective against Fire enemies. Different Cards can be gained as rewards for defeating enemies in Combat, or by exploring certain areas of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Trailer:\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T07:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d29/d295bd9a6e947b1b987daf2d06821314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Godsoul guy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
