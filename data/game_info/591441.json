There is no tutorial, so try this:</p>\n<ol><li>Move camera on WASD</li><li>You have a Castle (HQ rect), where you can **recruit dwarves** to fight for you</li><li>You can create buildings. Currently available are: Power Plant which is used for lighting surroundings, Barricades (walls) and Factory for some dwarves upgrades.</li><li>Each dwarf initially has a pickaxe. You can select him by **left click** and send them to the nearest ore vein by **right click** to gather resources</li><li>While dwarf is selected, you can upgrade his weapon and armor\u00a0**(Note: dwarf can not gather resources with any weapon except pickaxe)**</li></ol>\n<p>Be quick and prepare your defenses, because angry bugs soon will come to your base.</p>\n<p>This version could be buggy, unbalanced and unplayable at all and I'm really sorry for that. It was my first solo gamejam and I ran out of time. But more content to come, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/SmelJey/DeepestMine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:18:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3a0f2c634db75181b2d32e068fbc2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmelJey"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
