{"id": 829676, "slug": "gerrymandered", "name": "Gerrymandered!", "name_original": "Gerrymandered!", "description": "<p>A work-in-progress\u00a0puzzle game based on the concept of gerrymandering.</p>\n\r\nCreating a Custom Game:\r\n<p>Currently, there is only the \"Custom Game\" mode. You can add or subtract parties or change the number and size of districts to make the game more complex. A series of interesting puzzles and a complex tale of political intrigue is planned.</p>\n<p>When changing the number of voters, the district size changes automatically to represent the fairest size for each district. (It is best to accept the value given.) The maximum size represents how many voters (houses) a district can have in it. The minimum size represents how few voters\u00a0can have before the votes are counted.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nDrawing Districts:\r\n<p>In the game, a panel of districts is on the right. You can select a district, or just begin drawing with the left-mouse button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Squares placed on houses will use up the district's available houses. Placing squares on non-houses or empty spaces will cost nothing.</p>\n<p>To erase a square from a district, click again or right-click.</p>\n<p>If a space is closed off, the game checks to see if the selected district has enough squares to fill the space. If it does, it will fill them automatically. This saves you time from having to fill in large areas on bigger maps.\u00a0If the district does not have enough squares to fill the area, the area will flash red, indicating that you cannot block that space. This is determined by the minimum size value.\u00a0The process is currently buggy and if it annoys you too much, try turning the minimum size value to zero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you place a district, the next squares need to be placed directly next to it. Another feature in the works is to automatically connect a line from the closest square occupied by the selected district. This way, the player won't have to always click an adjacent square to highlight more territory.</p>\n<p>The challenge of the game will be to win with as little of the popular as possible, so try to get the party with the fewest voters to win.</p>Known Issues:<p>Game will crash with over 90\u00a0houses. Working on a fix.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926f60be5a6d45ab5f13ebc509f11205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wetbadger"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
