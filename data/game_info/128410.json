A technical demo for me to test out different procedural city generation methods and basic navigation AI. The city is generated in real time by placing a small random amount of hub towers, then connecting them via a road network, then expanding the road network by drawing perpendicular segments and finally placing buildings on the sides of the road segments.</p>\n<p>Once the first building is placed, a traffic system comes into play, hovercars are spawned inside the garages where they fly out and proceed to navigate to a random garage, once they reach the entrance of the target garage, if this is not busy, they'll proceed to dock and leave the scene.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>H - shows hide the UI<br/>Space - switch camera between overview and chase<br/>Tab - switch the POV to a different hovercar<br/>P - spawns a player controlled hovercar</p>\n<p>W - Accelerate player hovercar<br/>Mouse - Steer player hovercar</p>\n<p>Vehicles were made using AssetForge<br/>Buildings were made using Sketchup<br/>Fantastic music downloaded from Bensound<br/>https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/sci-fi</p>\n<p>Developed by<br/>Juan Rodriguez</p>\n<p>If you are interested in getting the sourcecode contact me at juan.rod707@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/>Juan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba082524ef6ab4b6adb4e542fa9c66e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juan Rodriguez"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
