What if those stories were kept by Alice Liddell herself. Instead of widespread knowledge of her existence, she might have been shut into obscurity, no one believing the words of a child even up to her death.</p>\n<p>Alice Lidell had one surviving child, and he he had one daughter of his own. Now, that daughter has lived a long life, shut up in her home, abandoning her own children late in life. You're her daughter, and you've just inherited her house.</p>\n<p>Discover the secrets that kept her away from you. Discover the tale her grandmother left.</p>\n<p>===================</p>\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours for Discord Jam 2, hosted by the moderators of the Ludum Dare Discord.</p>\n<p>This is my first jam where I have decided not to make everything from scratch.\u00a0I ended up using several assets I had lying around. It felt good to finally use them.</p>\n<p>This game is mouse-and-keyboard driven. I am using a standard character controller (WASD for movement, controllers should work). If the dot in the center of your screen becomes bigger, that means you can click to interact with something.</p>\n<p>This is a bit of a scavenger hunt. Read the letters carefully, they might help you find what you're looking for. When the time comes, you may notice some documents labeled with numbers. You can open and close those documents by typing the indicated number. You can turn pages with a and d or left arrow or right arrow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T04:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/377/37715f590c4e783a6e6250a0460cb958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
