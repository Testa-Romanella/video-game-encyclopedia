What makes a pupusa so special isn\u2019t necessarily the just ingredients, it\u2019s the motions that have been passed down through generations.\r\n</p>\n<p>When the player performs the correct actions using motion controls, they will unlock a piece to a bigger mural that tells a story about one of three different time periods: present day El Salvador, 1920s \u2013 1980s El Salvador, and Kuskatan (pre-colonial West El Salvador).\r\n</p>\n<p>The intention of the game is to serve as a way for players to learn, or remind themselves, about the Indigenous roots of a popular food that many of us love. As well to preserve the rich history of the food that our ancestors have created thousands of years ago and continue to celebrate today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Connect a Nintendo JoyCon to your Mac or PC via Bluetooth.</li><li>Using motion controls, perform the correct action at the correct time to unlock a piece of the mural.
