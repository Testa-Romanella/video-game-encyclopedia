The theme for the game jam was \"waves\". The team was excited about the prospect of waves as a form of communication between humans and thought that a game about propagating human waves would be a fun project. The game that resulted is a 2D top down local multiplayer game created using the LibGDX framework.</p><p>The players use the space bar on desktop (any part of screen on mobile) to \"wave\" down neutral pedestrians. Each pedestrian can only wave \"one\" time. To win the game connect with every pedestrian in the city!<br/></p><p>Team Members: Dominic Mortlock, Skanda Narendra Bhargav, Zac Patel and Ben Thomas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f45f92c2ba7fc13343b9c8eec61b6fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["freebrunch"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
