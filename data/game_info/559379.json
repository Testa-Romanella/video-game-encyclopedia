It also keeps track of how many cells you are able to light up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf879d3301b78527b20bd9dd8025c354.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["LordHill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
