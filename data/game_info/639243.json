I'm afraid I might miss the deadline due to work and life getting in the way, so I'm going to submit what I have. There's no sound, but I hope you manage to find some enjoyment. Thanks for playing!\r\n</p>\n<p>- - - - -\r\n</p>\n<p>It's definitely a game I'd like to continue working on.\u00a0 Mechanics and features I would of liked to add that were planned were:\r\n</p>\n<p>- A GTA wanted-like system where the higher your score, the stronger and more varied the opposition becomes.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Being able to make a few zombies follow you.\r\n</p>\n<p>- A bigger stage or different stages to choose from.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I should have made the AI smarter, it's so simple as it stands at the moment. This makes the game pretty simple and repetitive, with the different enemy types this wouldn't be so apparent but i definitely cheaped out there. Also I would have got people to play test it.. I was so focused on making it I completely overlooked getting opinions on it. total oversight.\r\n</p>\n<p>Just some notes on the game. Thanks for reading if you did, hope you enjoy the project!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a21f379600c8a953d452f6099956fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StayToasty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
