At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy.<br/>In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates!<br/><br/>The App allows you to play the game on all 4 levels and also includes a  new fifth level as special challenge .<br/><br/>Gain achievements by excellent performance!<br/><br/>Try to beat the community in the weekly highscore list!<br/><br/>The newest addition is finally there: King of the Island!<br/>Beat up to 1024 players in a tournament with synchronized games to become the true King of the Island.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T20:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1e82563831f1a9c708f94a58f4dcc3f.jpg", "website": "http://freitag.brettspielwelt.de", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["BrettspielWelt"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Brettspielwelt"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
