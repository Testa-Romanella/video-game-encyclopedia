Intuitive touch control allows you to tilt and turn, zoom in and out to match tiles in 3D. Play \u201carcade style\u201d with progressively difficult levels and high scores, or relax with one of the non-competitive game modes. The gameplay is simple yet addictive.<br/><br/>Moonlight Mahjong features four main types of play:<br/><br/>\u2022 Scramble Mode: Match tiles faster than the automated opponent \"Tilebot\" through increasingly difficult levels. The board is automatically reshuffled when you run out of matches, making this game mode easy to start and fun, yet challenging on the higher levels.<br/><br/>\u2022 Challenge Mode: Compete against Tilebot in full puzzle mode, with no automatic reshuffling, only undo. Challenge requires more strategy than Scramble. This is the \u2018pure\u2019 form of the game, but it is difficult!<br/><br/>\u2022 Puzzle Mode: Solve puzzle boards with no time limit. Choose any layouts you like. This is the original game mode, what people usually think of as Mahjong Solitaire.<br/><br/>\u2022 Relaxation Mode: Clear boards with no time limit and automatic reshuffling when out of matches. Perfect for when you're just not in the mood to strategize or rush.<br/><br/>This free advertising-supported version of Moonlight Mahjong features five complete game modes (the main four, plus 'Lightning Mode').
