You are in a spaceship and we wanted it to feel like it. The interaction with these puzzles is the same as in the rest of the game trying to not break the immersion in the story.</p>\n<p>And you'll also can interact with the terminals and computers around the ship. Some will give you key information, others will help you in your way out. There is a whole operating system full of software and apps filled with information of any kind to explore and take advantage of. You'll have a tool (called Mnem/0z1n3) that will help you gathering and classifying information and breaking through password protected terminals.</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<p>MINIMUM:<br/>OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64 bits)<br/>Processor: i5 4260u 1.4GHz<br/>Memory: 4GB<br/>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 1GB/AMD Radeon HD 6870 1GB or better<br/>DirectX: Version 10<br/>Storage: 5GB</p>\n<p>RECOMMENDED:<br/>OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64 bits)<br/>Processor: i5 6600 3.3GHz<br/>Memory: 8GB<br/>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB/AMD Radeon R9 290 4GB or better<br/>DirectX: Version 11<br/>Storage: 5GB</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p>- First person exploration game.<br/>- A deeply narrative game with a plot full of twists and mysteries.<br/>- Puzles you'll have to solve while advancing in the main story.<br/>- A variety of beautifully crafted sceneries.</p>\r\nPROLOGUE DEMO\r\n<p>The Fall of Lazarus: The First Passenger is the conclusive prologue and demo of The Fall of Lazarus. In this little adventure set in the year 2180 you will play as Caleb Rogers, a Gen-Ethics (an audit firm focused on controlling the normative and quality of criogenic, clonation and genetic alteration processes) who wakes up in the USSC Lazarus against his will.The First Passenger is a little slice of the final game where we showcase all the playable mechanics of the full game and also works as an example of the narrative we want to play with. You can play a whole level of the USSC Lazarus out of the five levels will include the final game, every one of them highly detailed and full of objects and terminal to interact with while playing the main story. But we wanted you to enjoy this little stand alone experience separately if you want to. This is only the prologue with another protagonist but we highly recommend you to stay tuned and, when the day comes, enjoy the full experience.</p>\r\nREFERENCES\r\n<p>When we have to describe The Fall of Lazarus in a phrase we always say \u00abit's like Firewatch (Campo Santo) meets the film Moon (Duncan Jones)\u00bb.</p>\n<p>The astonishing off-frame and foreshadowing narrative of Moon is our core narrative reference and the slow paced development of the plot and clever dialogues of Firewatch are really inspiring to us.</p>\n<p>Of course we're filled with references such us Gone Home, Mind: Path to Thalamus, The Guest and films like 2001: a space odyssey or Alien. Even Lost series are being really influencing because of how it works the mysteries and characters.</p>\r\nPLATFORMS\r\n<p>We will launch The Fall of Lazarus on PC at first. We obviously want to release it on as much platforms as we can, but right now we have to focus on the PC version. We also like to port the game to VR but we have to wait to see how things work.</p>\r\nFOLLOW US\r\n<p>Follow the development of our game:</p>\n<p>Official website: http://www.thefalloflazarus.com<br/>Follow us: https://twitter.com/NoWandStudios<br/>Visit: http://www.nowandstudios.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/241f20dd351f291557c0d1c46fc48a35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["No Wand Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
