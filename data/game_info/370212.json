Meanwhile you have to navigate and avoid their fluid (until the cycle of suffering that is life is too much for you).  A very simple concept with surprisingly deep game dynamics, which all come from the physics of fluid dynamics.  Learn to play in the flow: follow where it leads and subtly manipulate it toward success; resist it and you are doomed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T03:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8c5f5ce8c6b1b7f43f99a9270869fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Luke Palmer", "Namaste Reid"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Luke Palmer"], "esrb_rating": null}
