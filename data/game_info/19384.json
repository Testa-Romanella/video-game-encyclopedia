{"id": 19384, "slug": "the-binding-of-isaac", "name": "The Binding of Isaac", "name_original": "The Binding of Isaac", "description": "<p>The Binding Of Isaac is a roguelike top-down \u201cshooter\u201d with RPG elements. Initially, a Flash game, the game had earned many fans due to its unique art style, spooky and catchy ambient music, and almost infinite replayability. Randomly generated levels, loot, and enemies will provide quite a challenge for those unfamiliar with roguelike games, and will bring joy to the eye of an experienced player.<br />\nThe game\u2019s protagonist is Isaac, a child from a religious family. His misadventures are based off a biblical story about a character of the same name, although the gameplay itself certainly does not follow the same footsteps. There are also additional, unlockable characters with unique abilities and traits, which will affect your playthrough\u2019s difficulty. <br />\nThe Binding of Isaac featured non-linear levels, which brought about different outcomes of the game. Depending on the character played, playstyles can also differ, allowing players to create and share new metals for further replayability, and eventual full completion of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2011-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cef/cefedf18016cbab466861eb698daf988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 164, "owned": 4932, "beaten": 636, "toplay": 110, "dropped": 649, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 99, "ratings_count": 1153, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1163, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Edmund McMillen"], "esrb_rating": null}
