Bombs are raining down everyday, their town is sealed off, communications aren't working, and all they can wait for is a confusing and merciless death. Until one day, two strangers arrive on a motorbike, offering a chance not only for escape, but for salvation.<br/><br/>Twenty year old Rachel, however, has other problems to worry about.<br/><br/>You see, she doesn't think she's right in the head. Sometimes she thinks there's another person living inside of her.
