So I have sent a link to a shared drive that would/ should let you download the game. If you cannot play the game as the file is still too big, but want to see the final product, no worries I have a playthrough on my Website.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://tuiqereqerel.wixsite.com/mysite</p>\n\n<p>- Now there is a lot of updates since the update before. So tread carefully. I do recommend changing the music before you play as it is quite loud in the beginning.
