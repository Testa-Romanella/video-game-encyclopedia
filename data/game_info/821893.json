I'm happy I caught this one and put 30+ hours into the project, I'm very happy with how my game turned out, and I definitely intend on developing it further.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>(It's actually fun to play in my opinion, playtesting it was an honest blast)<br/><br/>With that being said, the theme was \"Roll of the Dice\", which if you take a look at one my older projects.. I've already made a game ENTIRELY ON DICE ROLLS. Instead, there are nice elements of randomness thrown into the game to test players luck.<br/><br/>Enemy attack projectiles have varying speeds, supply boxes (loot boxes) drop down at random intervals, with random tiers of loot boxes with goodies inside. The player has a nice teleport ability, which sometimes gets you nice and far, other times not so much, don't rely on it. Enemies randomly spawn at their spawn points, which can be right next to you. Definitely use your ears as if you hear one spawn right next to you, you have to react quick.<br/><br/>Wall of text aside, this was an honest blast to make, and I hope you enjoy giving it a try.\u00a0<br/><br/>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:04:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/150/1509689319c7bac135d6c632566793bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kusaji"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
