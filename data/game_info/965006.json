If you want to torture yourself on a level even beyond what I made this game for, then sure, try and play with keyboard. Don't say I didn't warn you though.<br/><br/>Completing this challenge won't be easy. You will fall, many times, and it will always be your fault. Eventually you'll feel into the technique of controlling two things at once. Through your failures you'll learn the many emergent tricks of a seemingly simple game. Maybe, just maybe, you'll find the peak of this tortuous game. Even more difficult will be the quest to discover each secret and shortcut. <br/><br/>The art and music might not be this game's selling point, but there's 26 ball costumes, 8 world themes, and 13 original music tracks to hopefully keep your interest.<br/><br/>If you manage to beat my game, I'd love it if you let me know.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T04:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b31ffd22d4a2f3eff3489b3a061ab2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Epsilous"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Epsilous"], "esrb_rating": null}
