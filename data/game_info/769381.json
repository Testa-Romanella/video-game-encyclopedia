Each unit has a special ability, which upgrades with the unit. However, be careful. If you lose all your lives you must start rebuilding your team from the very beginning! Isn't that nice...<br/><br/>Currently there is only 1 game mode to play, however I would love to add more gamemodes, units and unlockables in the future!<br/><br/><strong>Please note: If you find any balance issues and want to help them be fixed, send a message in my discord or twitter.
