You can understand it watching the letter that he sent to you. You will see a postcard where there will be the toys that he alredy has, which they will be different and with different colors. But one combination will be missing! Found it and give it away to the little child! (If you want to know more about the rules, you can search the famouse card game ghost blitz, which I was inspired by).</p>\n<p>All the graphics, animation and code\u00a0is made by me. The original idea of the gameplay is in the game, but there are a lot of details missing, which I hope to insert as soon as possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T12:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16bcdd9b5685801251c60744cb617f2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["robottoboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
