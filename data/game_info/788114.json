One player acts as Narrator or Game Master, while other players take on the role of survivors.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Making it through one more day is as important as scavenging materials and supplies. Some survivors may strive to better their peers, building the community they came from or found a new home. Some survivors scavenge for personal wealth and power, hoarding bullets and unearthing strange and valuable artifacts from the time Before. Other survivors may simply want to punch whatever they find, or watch what\u2019s left of civilization in the Wastes burn around them\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>Survivors take on one of six roles:\u00a0<strong>Fighter</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Finder</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Fixer</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Face</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Fate</strong>, or\u00a0<strong>Freefolk</strong>. Each job has a unique skill that lets them negotiate conflicts and situations. Along with keeping track of what gear or weapons they have strapped to their person, survivors must manage a number of different effects with which they can be afflicted.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Brave the Wastes</em>\u00a0in a one-page, rules-light Role-Playing Game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Oct. 2017</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:51:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af476c8648ee19c09a043ed52d96daf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atethrie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
