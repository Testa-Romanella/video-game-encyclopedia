It was a very cool experience with a good theme.<br/>I made all of this game and I record parts of it on my\u00a0twitch channel, if you want !<br/>Have fun with a classical piano music\u00a0and tick tock background !</p>\r\nInformation:\r\n<p>I reupload my game because I only modified its name (I'm french and a little dumb.. I wrote \"tik tok\"\u00a0instead of \"tick tock\")<br/>You can compare between the two project sources, nothing more is modified</p>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T03:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/2697d7e8760dfa29e61f63e253e7a0dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Mandytoh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
