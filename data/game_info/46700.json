Win big and live like a king and feast on kebabs and drink beer in the local pub. Take some exercise on the beach. Lose your shirt in the betting shop and you risk starvation in and endless cycle of eat, bet, sleep and repeat!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFaithfully recreated old fashioned smelly, dingy, smoke filled betting shop complete with authentic racing commentary (using the latest in speech synthesis technology) and sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStudy the Sporting Life newspaper, place your bet and listen as the race is played out in realistic nail biting audio commentary. Why hasn't the commentator mentioned your nag yet? Will it swoop late? Is it tailed off? And will Grimsby Town finally get a win this Saturday? Will you eat tonight or take another miserable step towards starvation, disease and death?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake a walk on the beach to gain a health boost or visit the pub in a Monopoly 'community chest' style card rewards system.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/0212fc1b639449f18384e36c1a57ad18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strategic Designs"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Strategic Designs"], "esrb_rating": null}
