Explore the vast overworld and complete quests to obtain powerful duck-shaped rocks that can be used to warp to the domain of The Void in order to defeat him. Explore five completely distinct regions, each with their own procedurally-generated dungeon. Collect up to 8 of the 12 weapons in the game, ranging from a simple stick to an RPG launcher. Forge your own path and work at your own leisure!<br/></p>\n<p>Serving as a soft reboot of the Stone Duck series, Kingdom of the Void incorporates ideas from both The Legend of the Stone Ducks and Dungeons and Ducks. This game was last updated in 2017.\u00a0Most notably, this game is a fully-fledged open-world RPG. However, this comes at a cost: you need a fairly beefy computer to run it.\u00a0 Unlike the previous games, I still have the source files for this one so I can continue development if I decide to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/784/78412a49322ca3fd2fe182b9a45acdd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChiirYuu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
