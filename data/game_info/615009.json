Or avoid reloading all-together by never missing an attack!</h3>Each stage is a unique shoebox diorama, filled with action-oriented puzzles and delightfully violent Boxy creatures to battle.<br/>Each Boxy type is susceptible to exactly one kind of attack, out of four in your arsenal, but actually landing an attack requires learning enemy patterns and controlling enemy groups.<br/>And that\u2019s before encountering the dreaded\u2026 Zomboxies.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the deal with Boxy World - it\u2019s greatest resource is its people. <strong>Literally.</strong>Every house, couch or deadly weapon is made from the corpses of dead Boxy\u2019s. Luckily every Boxy is exactly 10 x 10 in proportion - except for little Moxy Boxy. Manufactured at only 8 x 8, she literally does not fit in.<br/>Desperate to be accepted, Moxy proves herself as a powerhouse Green soldier, taking on Blues, Reds and Purples with deadly precision.<br/>Until one afternoon when she encounters a Yellow Boxy - long thought extinct - and is ordered to destroy her on sight. Every Boxy is a potential resource, after all.<br/>The Indestructible Moxy Boxy is an examination of guilt, consequences and atonement, told over five acts and 150 dioramas.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T02:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/04335ab438abbd6ded4d0946761e0480.jpg", "website": "https://www.moxyboxy.ca/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Playvir Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playvir Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
