{"id": 618450, "slug": "super-ladder-sprint", "name": "Super Ladder Sprint", "name_original": "Super Ladder Sprint", "description": "<p>*More info coming soon, it has now been a rush to get the game online in time for the GMTK - jam *</p>\n<p>Both characters are connected through the ladder. At least one of them needs to have footing on a platform or they both die ! Try to gather as many coins as you can while avoiding obstacles. Spikey balls will paralyze you, rendering the hit character unusable for 5 seconds. Exclamation boxes will kill you and end your run. Enoy !!!</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p>\n<p>UP/DOWN arrow key (UP controls the upper character, DOWN controls the bottom character). Alternatively, you can use your mouse and click the top half or bottom half on the screen (similar to the mobile version).</p>\n\n\n<p>* DISCLAIMER *</p>\n<p>If you are wondering why you are randomly dying in game? That's because there are invisible sprites in this version. I actually had fixed this in the last hour of the jam, but in a complete episode of \"muppetness\", I've uploaded the version from my thumb drive, which was not the latest one.</p>\n<p>If anything, there is a fixed version available, but again, please be considerate of the rules... I would appreciate it if you would rate it with fair-play and consider the fixed version only for the late submissions \"sister jam\" of GMTK, where I also have submitted. Trust me, the current version is more than enough to bring across the general concept and mechanics, so I hope it suffices.</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards and thank you for playing my game,</p>\n\n<p>Dr. JavaSaurus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:43:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b2505a133ff4c4180b0ea6bb189e0b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JavaSaurus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
