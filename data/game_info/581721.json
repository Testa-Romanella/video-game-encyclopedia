Resolution &amp; Dissolution, tying in historical events to fictional events in-game.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>6) Alt\u00a0Room - Closet: Expository, and gives the player more information regarding their location and time-frame.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I utilized Scott McCloud's concept of Timeframes, where I visualized \"time as a rope. Each inch represents a second... portraying time on a line moving left to right, putting all the images on the same vertical axis\" (McCloud 96-97).\u00a0 The structure of the game in room transitions reads like a book would, or a \"rope\"; for example, the transition between the hazmat room and the brass' office goes from left to right - exemplifying this concept.\u00a0 This causes an easier grasp for the player to immerse themselves in the story, rather than having to focus on plot structure.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The lessons used from the theme park readings/videos were utilized in building an immersive world narratively.\u00a0 There's multiple objects that can be interacted with to give more information to the player about the location and timeframe of the game.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, building sets and rooms where their purpose\u00a0can be easily identified is imperative to player retention.\u00a0 When a player has to spend cognitive effort and time processing what they are even seeing, it detracts from the narrative.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Bitsy's 2D aspect allowed me to design the game with a top-down perspective, which made for an exciting set design.\u00a0 The overall simplicity of the platform made for an easy experience in telling an interactive historical fiction narrative of the Manhattan Project in 1941.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c372f7e05b7a0fa27accd9e5a80f88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cadthomp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
