The canonical status of Art of Theft within the Chzo Mythos proper is debated; were it to be included, Art of Theft takes place two years before 5 Days a Stranger. Tired of robbing manors of the English countryside and wanting to become the greatest thief in the world, Trilby takes his thieving skills and trademark hat to the shores of America. He soon becomes the target of a mysterious organization known only as The Company, which tries to blackmail Trilby into working for them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T02:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890222ce8c4ac366b976b92e0141f45f.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/Trilby_The_Art_of_Theft", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw"], "esrb_rating": null}
