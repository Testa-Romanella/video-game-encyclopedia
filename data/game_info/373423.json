It's just $1, and a short clicker game with craziness ready to be unleashed. Bananas! Apples! Peaches! You name it!

This also means that the game is not 100% polished, but updates are still well on the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60ec8ba571984da1c5271cdaae5e8ddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JustDopeGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
