But be careful! Danger lurks around every turn and falling prey to a spike trap will send you right back to the start without any treasure. Will you turn back now to keep what you've collected, or will you roll the dice and see what treasures and dangers are just around the corner?</p>\n<p>A game by Caleb Vatral made for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note for Gamepad Users: </strong>A bug in Unity seems to be preventing the use of joysticks for menu navigation. The only menu navigation is on the title screen, but for that you will have to use the D-Pad to navigate.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad3ea6ad9da4414370495f8714b9d583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nat1Wizard"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
