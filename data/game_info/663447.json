Might expand this into a full little game in the future,\u00a0with new levels and mechanics, better visuals\u00a0and, hopefully, a soundtrack; any suggestion is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d54acc1e63492859d2052383703e5515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raeino"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
