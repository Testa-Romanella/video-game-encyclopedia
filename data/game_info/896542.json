The proposed project focuses not only on medieval architecture and character building in VR environments, but also on the interaction between users and the VR environment. Different centuries and different countries will have different historical heritages and environments. And the historical legacy of medieval themes has received little attention. The public's impression of the Middle Ages only stays on architecture and clothing, but in fact, the medieval market contains rich culture of the times, which is very worth experiencing and learning.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T22:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9db133726ade12b42da5ad1b655dd20a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kerkzy"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
