We first wanted to develop as much gameplay as we could without creating dozens of level each times. <br/>\r\nWe wish to make this game bigger with the help of the players, depending of what they prefer most.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, have fun with this version of the game and tell us what you think.<br/>\r\nBuying this game now will get you all the next, more complete, versions for free.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d404100cfa5604fc65ef6cf766dc0bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IOZO GAMES"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IOZO GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
