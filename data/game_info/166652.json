This is my demake prototype of Alan Wake that originally was published for X360\u00a0(2010)\u00a0and PC (2012). I had only 2 days for development so the prototype is barely playable. But you still can roam around and\u00a0 'shoot' some enemies with flashlight OR you can get killed, instead.</p>\n<p>Have a nice play !</p>\n\n<p>PSX shaders:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://github.com/dsoft20/psx_retroshader<br/></p>\n<p>3rd Person Dummy from Unity Asset store:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/third-person-controller-...<br/></p>\n<p>Partical textures\u00a0:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/seamless-2<br/></p>\n<p>Music :\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/old-city-theme</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>AWSD - walk</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Shift - run</p>\n<p>Mouse - look around</p>\n<p>R - restart</p>\n\n<p>Ps.
