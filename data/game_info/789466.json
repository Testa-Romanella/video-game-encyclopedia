This cutscene will end when you receive the gameplay instructions. Towards the end of this scene when you are in the cockpit of the spaceship, you can move the mouse to look around.</p>\n<p>Second Cutscene - Is a\u00a0hidden Idle cinematic.\u00a0This will automatically play when you are in the gameplay session if you haven't pressed a key for 10 seconds. At the end of this idle cinematic, it will start the Gameplay session again. Make sure to press a key during this time so you don't go through the idle cinematic again.</p>\n<p>Third Cutscene - The Final cutscene (which I won't give too many secrets away)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/5324b376f7a96fa3089ce1932e9cef5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChrisHilton"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
