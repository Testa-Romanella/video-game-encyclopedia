You all know that to get to the top you must sacrifice a few fellow oranges.</p>\n<p>The whole concept of the game is to reach the top of the blender by using your past oranges as platforms and walls to bounce off of.</p>\n<p>Jumping is done by holding, or pressing W and moving left and right with A and D. You can sacrifice yourself manually if you press SPACE and are adjacent to another orange. Aim to collect all of the coins and make it to the top!</p>\n<p>Upon reflection, I feel that more time should have been spent in development stages and coming up with a definitive idea since this one was changed a number of times. Furthermore, I would have preferred some more polish if given the time which I don\u2019t have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fc/9fcddb9b82e51ea36bde16ad5dcb7d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Koltonix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
