Flippin' Fours adds the ability to rotate the board instead of dropping a piece. Upon rotation, the pieces will fall with gravity. Get 4 of the same color in a row to win! If two 4-in-a-rows are completed at once, it's a tie (unless one player have more than 4 in a row or possibly multiple concurrent 4-in-a-rows.) It's more difficult than it sounds!</p><p>WARNING: VERY UNPOLISHED</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<ol><li>Launch the game and wait for it to connect to the server.</li><li>Type a password in the upper text field and click the Create button.</li><li>Tell you friend (or enemy) to type the password in the lower text field and click the Join button.</li><li>Click above the board to drop a piece or rotate the board with the buttons on the left and right.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/041eecd7c0a8168e1c9bf1e4d649d7fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ReidHarry"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
