You will probably have your own point of view that will guide you during the game, or maybe the game will guide your point of view... the goal is that at the end, you will have your own point of view that is unlike any other presented in the game. In any case, the avatar you control has its own point of view that you can discover if you wish.\r\nIt will be up to you to conclude whether you have participated in the construction of a protagonist or an antagonist, according to what he has convinced himself.\r\nOne day, this game will be removed and the sequel to this game will be released. You will face the character whose story you are building here and you will have the choice of opposing him, or joining him.\r\nThis game was started by a child. Expect to see elements that a child might dream of putting into his game, with its influences and conclusions.\r\nEnjoy the game and thank you for reading.\r\n<ul><li>Credits\u00a0</li><li>And for my main team: thank you to\u00a0Hibya (charadesign &amp; drawing) &amp; Jig\u00e9 / Karno / Khamelot (some song created for the game).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d6/8d67cb0439e8e1170b32cbd1258ea880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solynut"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
