Next you will need  to get every Element and you will create High Particles (first prestige  currency) you can Ascend to get High Particles faster or reset Brewing  but its not recommended at start. Unlock more potions in Ascend \u00a0and  Refining, second reset layer (Metal) doesn't reset Brewing but it resets  High Particles, and doesn't reset Ascend upgrades and unlocks, for  Metal you can buy metals in Metal tab, they grants carious boosts (few  useless, so don't worry to use them) and you can Refine for metals, use  carefully no-useless metals. Metal reset don't give you writen amount of  Metal but turn you current to written value.\r\n  </p>\n<p>good luck <br/></p>\n<p>Kijomsz</p>\n<p>game version : 1.0.1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T17:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/229/2290b74568a63a86eb61ec9c69cdc8b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kijomsz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
