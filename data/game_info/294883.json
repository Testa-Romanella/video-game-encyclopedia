Search through the crashed spaceship, while meeting with the planet's natural inhabitants. Be cautious though, they're not as harmless as they seem.<br/><br/>This game was made as an entry for 2019 TV Game Jam. Jam's theme was to explore the episodes of famous TV shows, and mine was Doctor Who and the Weeping Angels. Hope you like it!<br/><br/>I always welcome feedback! In the case of this game, I am looking mostly for <em>gameplay</em> and <em>level design</em> feedback. But you are more than welcome to comment on whatever you like!<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. as of right now the game doesn't have a heavy story to support it's gameplay. It was also made in just two weeks, so a few bugs and rushed decisions might be present.</p><p>V 1.0 - initial Game Jam version<br/>V 1.1 - day-one essential patch.
