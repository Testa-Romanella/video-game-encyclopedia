A card has 10 columns. The machine\u2019s clock is 1 Hz, so cards finish running every 10 seconds.<br/></p>\n<p>Each column is one instruction or data point. With Data pressed you   can punch the necessary task input numbers, then with Data off you punch   the instructions needed to solve the problem. Use Shift to get access   to more instructions.  </p>\n<p>But to the machine data is code and code is  data. You\u2019ll notice the  card can only punch numbers from 0 to 9. If you  need 12 type for ex the  instructions 93+. Once you punched a card add it  to the source deck  that will be executed. You can sort the cards there.  Good luck! The  future needs you.</p>\n<p><em>(The web build has a bit of lag for some reason. The PC builds are fine.)</em><br/></p>\n<p>I made this game in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 51 jam, my first LD ever. You may encounter some bugs! I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Design, art, sounds, programming are done by me. I used the Godot game engine, v.3.5, the JetBrainsMono font and sfxr for sound effects.</p>\n<p>Consider joining my Discord server for game dev discussions and / or my Twitch channel for live streams.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T20:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/7475aab1f234d3dc716962e91b392f2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["seshoumara"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
