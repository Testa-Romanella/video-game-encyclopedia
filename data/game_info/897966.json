{"id": 897966, "slug": "vacation-troubles", "name": "Vacation Troubles", "name_original": "Vacation Troubles", "description": "<p><strong>Vacation Troubles </strong>is a platformer game where the player adventures through four different levels. Those levels are themed in seasons. The further the player progresses the more serious the levels get. Climate change starts to destroy the environment and creates difficult obstacles. The player must overcome all of them, including various enemies. The end goal is to finish a certain level to fulfill the characters quest. However, every season also offers opportunities, which are presented in form of different abilities. With those on their side, the player has to fight against all odds.</p>\n\n<p>The game presents climate change in a new way. The player experiences four little stories. Even though every story has a unique value, all the obstacles the player must face in each level have the same origin - climate change. The levels get progressivly harder the further the user progresses. This exact concept makes Vacation Troubles so unique - it tells four self-contained stories, which overall, however, result in a fitting overall picture.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:17:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f3a009105d4471480e83d205eda15d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Averimon", "lukas_krisper", "stefanie_ober", "dotjulia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
