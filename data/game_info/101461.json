DH:ROTWK is a 2-player competitive arcade game where a thicc Dragon and a gloopy Wizard King face off in a battle of ultimate strategy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, \u201cRevenge of the Wizard King\u201d is not a sequel, but a reboot of the Dragon Horde franchise. Open-World Battle-Royale elements have been scrapped in order to accommodate the superior high-intensity spirit of Jezzball.</p>\n<p>No one quite knows why the Magical Monarch wants revenge against the Dragon. Some say the Dragon re-did the interior design of the King\u2019s castle without his knowledge, thus replacing the floor with crumbling hexagonal pillars and the walls with bottomless pits. Others speculate that the Dragon is jealous of the way the King has mastered flight with his hot-air balloon, whilst the winged dragon is too large to fly.\u00a0 Whatever the reason, you can be sure that the deeply detailed lore of the Dragon Horde cinematic universe has a reasonable explanation for the King\u2019s incredible magical ability to literally plop bombs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>P1 is w,a,s,d,~,1,</p>\n<p>P2 is arrowkeys, period, /</p>\n<p>Players: 2</p>\n<p>Compatible with Winnitron</p>\n\n<p><strong>Created by:</strong><br/>Ben Bergman (Project Management)<br/>Stephanie Chacon-Vega (Programming)<br/>Kyle Hall (2D Art)<br/>Mitch Harder (3D Art)<br/>Matt Woelk (Programming)</p>\n<p>No Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abd6c9456970d9521d943198718ef2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MattWoelk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
