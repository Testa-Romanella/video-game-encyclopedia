If you grant access, BreatheLUV will use the Apple Health app and the Apple Watch to measure your heart rate. Your heart rate is stored locally on your Apple Watch and on your iPhone\u00a0and is never transmitted anywhere else. It's just a soft, subtle connection between BreatheLUV and you. We love syncing up. &lt;3<br/><br/>If you are interested, visit http://www.truluv.ai/selfcare/ to learn more about #SelfCare.  <br/><br/>&lt;3 Let's take a moment. &lt;3", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T21:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d7406e63d5717588ddc6d16cae87413.jpg", "website": "http://truluv.ai/selfcare", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tru Luv Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Tru Luv Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
