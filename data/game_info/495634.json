{"id": 495634, "slug": "isles-of-pangaea", "name": "Isles of Pangaea", "name_original": "Isles of Pangaea", "description": "Isles of Pangaea is a game where you play as the dinosaur, eating, drinking, growing, surviving, and becoming the top of the food chain.  Begin life on the isles as a hatchling and grow through eating while avoiding and overcoming danger at every turn.  To reach adulthood you must also avoid starvation and dehydration.  This means competing with other dinosaurs for resources.  Dinosaurs can bring food back to their nest to feed their young so their young can avoid some of the danger lurking around every corner.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCarcasses will spoil and then decay over time.  So carnivores be cautious, eating spoiled meat can make you sick and make navigating the island even more dangerous until the effects wear off.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCarnivores don't only look for prey, they can smell for it, so just staying out of sight won't be enough to keep you safe.  Non-predators can also smell for food and danger just not as effectively as predators.  The player can take advantage of smelling for food and danger as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDinosaurs have use of a basic attack for combat.  Some species even have the ability to make their target bleed and be dealt damage over time.  Bleeding does damage even while not in combat and moving makes it worse.  So the quicker they can eat and rest the quicker they can recover from bleeding or they could find themselves becoming food.  Others species are more resistant to the effects of bleeding and it doesn't pose as big of a threat to them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen in danger a dinosaur can call for help from nearby dinosaurs and sometimes other species may even come to help.  Beware, aggressive or hungry dinosaurs may hear the cries of help from a dinosaur and may become a threat themselves.  Some species can even form a pack or herd so they don't have to take on the challenges of the islands on their own.  You are in competition with other dinosaurs of your species when trying to make a pack, if they are more dominant and experienced in combat than you others will follow them instead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can choose to play as any one of fifteen dinosaur species.  Available species include: Ankylosaurus, Archelon, Brachiosaurus, Compsognathus, Dilophosaurus, Dimetrodon, Oviraptor, Parasaurolophus, Pteranodon, Sarcosuchus, Spinosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Tryannosaurus, and Velociraptor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently dinosaurs are only able to walk, run, and sprint across the land. They cannot yet swim or fly.\u200b<br/>\r\n\u200b<br/>\r\n\u200bThe islands are under constant development so the content (islands' terrain, 3d models, textures, animations, sound effects, UI images, etc.), features (the way a feature works, additional features, removal of features will only be done after careful consideration), and balance (dinosaur health, damage, run speed, attacks, growth rate, etc.) may change at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is what Isles of Pangaea currently has to offer players, many improvements and more features are on the way!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T01:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0d968caa2df73668d9d0d5668c64918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 476, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exhibyte"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Exhibyte"], "esrb_rating": null}
