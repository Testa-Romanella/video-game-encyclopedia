Each player will take control of a ship (being either Team NASA or Team SpaceX) and will have two minutes to fly around the game map, claiming territory for their team on planets and meteors.\u00a0Players can also blast each other to clear that team of all of their discoveries, allowing them to be claimed by the opposing team. Whoever has the most points when time runs out wins the game!</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 2018 Indie Galactic Space Jam in Orlando, Florida. I may update it in the future to polish it up more or add background music, but the version currently available for download is the one submitted for the jam.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a1bb06e96ae020e88d96b8bb9d666fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris Trenary"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
