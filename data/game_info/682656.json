{"id": 682656, "slug": "1840s-the", "name": "1840s the", "name_original": "1840s the", "description": "<p>This is '1840s the', a new video game from Outhouse Media.<br/>\nIt's not far afield from some of the big-budget productions I've seen, but this is a live-action debut from a small studio, and it's a very good thing. I'm glad I'm finally getting into video games again, and that some of my favourite films are back on the big screen, even if this is just a demo of some very intriguing ideas.\n\nThe demo had some minor glitches - the lines of dialogue had to be cut out, but I was able to get them to play properly as it was.\n\nI have yet to get into the two-person co-op mode, but it's set up as that. Moving your camera around allows you to see what position the other player is looking and what direction they're going in.\n\nIt's done all by hand, and looks quite good, but I'm curious to see if I can get the numbers up, since I haven't tried it at all. It's also quite nice how the game looks on my TV for distances, and I've been using that to test out the controls for it in my living room, as well as the demo version.\n\nI like the quality, but the little issues do make it a bit hard to tell the difference. The characters are, for the most part, great, but the voice acting has a bit of a 'cute' feel to it, and the dialogue looks a bit 'real' during the conversation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd731e4f7aad68b7d53a48a1e4c56d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
