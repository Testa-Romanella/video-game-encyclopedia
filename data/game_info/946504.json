Dodge obstacles, perform stunts, and race against other players as you try to make your deliveries on time. With challenging gameplay and stunning environments, this game will test your skills and keep you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>My Thoughts:<br/>This was a game made by me (and open source products) which was done in a day and a half. The game does lack ACTION and that will be put in later. Overall just happy its got the main parts of the game. And am looking forward to finishing it.<br/><br/>Project was made possible by:<br/>~Synty studios openworld pack<br/>~MFP multiplayer framework by Volette studios<br/>~photon pun ig<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef6bb6c2655f8322076336298ac363c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interstellar2026"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
