{"id": 650837, "slug": "undefined-3", "name": "{Undefined}", "name_original": "{Undefined}", "description": "The idea for {Undefined} came, because conventional games provide you with premade building blocks which can then be used to build stuff. But premade blocks always bring limitations. So we created {Undefined} where we provide as little premade objects as possible!<br/><br/>{Undefined} is a sandbox survival game like no other, set on <strong>life-sized voxel planets</strong> with realistic physics with the possibility to<strong> shape your own building blocks</strong>. From your custom made furniture, walls, crafting stations to vehicle parts. You shape the blocks which can then be used to build buildings, spacecraft and aircraft. Endless possibilites with as little limitations as possible!<br/><br/>Survive, gather resources and start designing and building!<h3>Feature List</h3><br/><ul><li> <strong>Object Designer</strong>: Lets you design your own building blocks and functional blocks (e.g. walls, furniture, machines, rocket parts, etc...) <br/></li><li> <strong>Planets and Moons</strong>: Fully destructible Voxel Planets (Drill them for ores or build underground bases), Nearly life-sized planets and moons, Various biomes, realistic atmosphere simulation, realistic gravity simulation, caves<br/></li><li> <strong>Game Modes</strong>: Survival, Creative<br/></li><li> <strong>Design Vehicles, Aircraft and Spacecraft</strong>: Our Object Designer also lets you build your own vehicle parts and therefor vehicles<br/></li><li> <strong>Complex Systems and Simulations</strong>: Electricity, Logic Systems, Conveyor System, Thermodynamic Simulation (Heat simulation, heat distributes to other blocks), Oxygen and Gas System, Automation Systems<br/></li><li> <strong>Farming</strong><br/></li><li> <strong>Singleplayer and Multiplayer</strong><br/></li><li> <strong>Utilizes Unreal Engine 4</strong></li></ul><h3>Voxel Planets</h3><br/>Life-sized voxel planets with various biomes and climate zones. From high mountains to flat grasslands, from hot deserts to cold arctic environments, you have to survive and use the resources you have!<br/><h3>Shape your own components!</h3><br/>Unlike in conventional games, in {Undefined} you can shape your own building components! Shape and design your own walls, furniture, machines, vehicle components, statues... you name it! Our <strong>Object Designer</strong> allows you to carefully design anything you can imagine without any limitations. You can even design functional blocks like lamps and crafting stations!<br/><h3>Now use your designs!</h3><br/>Of course, after designing your own furniture or building components, you will have to use them! Build the house of your dreams, or spacecraft to fly into space and construct a spacestation up there. The only limit is your imagination!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:50:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a12c9c9dda01f6612a0f4860665738b.jpg", "website": "https://undefinedthegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreshMountainStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FreshMountainStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
