It's as simple as that! Or is it?<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>You can use ARROW KEYS to move, but once the little guy gets going, he can't stop until he hits a wall!</p>\n<p>You can press SPACE to cross dimensions, opening up many new possibilities to explore!</p>\n<p>There are also the GREEN GATES and the corresponding RED BUTTONS which close them. They're easy. Just touch the red buttons and the doors will either open or close.</p>\n<p>Later on, there will be SPINNERS and BLUE BUTTONS that stop/start the spinners. The spinners don't do anything when they're spinning, but when they stop they block your path and don't let you across.</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Made using the Scratch engine!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9b6446aca790065ef61ab823ce9a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlamingSparrow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
