Futhermore she is the only one that can reveal light essences and activate the lanterns.</p>\n<p>A game designed so the players don't support each other just by being close, Bel has to see where the attacks come from, Kahu needs to attack at a certain rythm so he doesn't get hurt, if they get very close they benefit from their active and passive skills, but they will lose control over the map, on the other hand if both separate themselves they will have more vision of the action, but less time to draw together.</p>\n<p>Enjoy. \"</p>\n<p>Art made by:</p>\n<p>https://yarome.artstation.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2dbea83c3e7d7175e2b84e1554b4c470.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beekibye"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
