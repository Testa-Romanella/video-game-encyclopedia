{"id": 706833, "slug": "chomperman-ouya-version", "name": "Chomperman (OUYA version)", "name_original": "Chomperman (OUYA version)", "description": "<p><strong><em>NOTE: While there is a chance that this game will run on other Android devices, it was specifically designed for, and only tested on, the OUYA. Use at your own risk on other devices.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chomperman</strong> was an early game from CC &amp; SH, initially released in 2005. It was an adaptation of the \"Pac-Man\" game code written by Mark Overmars for the original pre-Studio versions of Game Maker. When releasing the rest of CC &amp; SH's oeuvre on the CD compilation\u00a0<em>CC &amp; SH: Smash Hits</em>, it was instead decided to remake the game rather than simply re-release it alongside the other games. This remake was released on CD-ROM on September 27, 2006.</p>\n<p>An OUYA conversion was developed from the ground up (no longer Overmars' code at all) and released almost 10 years later on June 2, 2016. This version features completely rehauled graphics, new voice acting from Trent Tutt, and a new level, built around a bonus item which was mistakenly unused in the previous version. The game also features cutscenes, as the browser release did, and a proper ending.</p>\n<p>Since the OUYA version was free, it is being offered as a separate entity on this itch.io page for free download (<em>plus itch.io won't let us edit the other Chomperman game any longer</em>).</p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<p>*The thumbstick sometimes does not seem to function properly, especially in tight corners, using a standard OUYA controller. This does not seem to happen with the d-pad or when utilizing an Xbox 360 controller, and this was not an issue on any of the test pre-release versions prior to publishing. Since the code for the d-pad and the thumbstick are the same (plus the fact that another controller has no problem with it), it is unknown what the cause is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed07fa9dc20403ed7f8d62a5c2ebb41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["CC & SH"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
