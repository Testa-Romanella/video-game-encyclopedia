It was for a school project we hade to realize in 3 weeks. At the end of the day, I couldn't finish the game, but I enjoyed working on it and could still do nowaday</p>\n<p>My aim was to make a game where the player can enjoy to have a beautiful personal and virtual place. I was inspired by the gardening activity in Animal Crossing games, something I liked to spend time doing when I was younger.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>At this step of the project, there isn't much to do. You can plant flowers that will give you money, to buy more flowers, and you don't really have any objective for now, just enjoy the experiment ^^</p>\n<p>I don't think the game works well on mobile, if you try it you should play on your computer</p>\n<p>Feel free to give me your advice on this project, maybe it will encourage me to keep working on it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e03f5b0d34b5dbd4ecaeba0cb55139ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meoanar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
