His <strong>weapon</strong> is a <strong>TOY</strong> that in his head is a real one that defeats the shadows behind him. Because of the storm, the lights are flickering, transitioning between imagination and reality. The kid is imagining everything, the monsters and other things in the house, and with the power of imagination the child is beating the shadows.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I made this\u00a0game with 3 more friends, that helped in programing, narrative and 2D art. The game is still in development, we couldn\u2019t finish the whole game in time but this is like a prototype or something like that. I hope you can catch the idea.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>HowToPlay</strong>: Use W-A-S-D and the mouse to aim and shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:43:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04a/04a17e703e6d0f0658291883246d36e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["murilinhops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
