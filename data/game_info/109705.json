Tensions are high between the US, North Korea, China, and South Korea and the decisions you make in a Tinder style game can either help maintain the fragile peace or instigate a nuclear war. The player must be quick in making decisions for each randomly chosen situation within each given time limit as every decision you make has its own consequences that pleases certain sides while angering others. Maintaining positive reputation meters with each country becomes increasingly difficult as it soon becomes clear that there is no way to please everyone. Whether you decide to maintain peace or bring Armageddon, Nuclear Tension guarantees a suspenseful story, difficult choices, and unpredictable dangers that make each play experience fun and unique. \r\n      </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfd7bb01271a369a2def0212e6dcf838.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Driverless"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
