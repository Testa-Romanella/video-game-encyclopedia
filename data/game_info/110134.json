In this arena, you hunt enemies by stealing their sides and taking them for yourself.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHaving fewer sides keeps you fast, nimble, and ready to hunt the bigger targets. However, becoming a triangle disables your ability to fire until you scavenge your way back up to at least 4 sides.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHaving more sides keeps you safe from the Elimination Timer, but you're slowed down and targeted more often.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhen the timer at the top of the screen hits 0, the Polygons with the lowest amount of sides gets eliminated. If you're one of them, it's GAME OVER.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFight your way to the top and defend your Polygon.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was created using Game Maker: Studio. The project files are available to download as well.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac33a606cb3ee442f3c533c37dd6ccf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Davis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
