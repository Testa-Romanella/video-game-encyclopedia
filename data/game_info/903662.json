In order to complete a level, you must defeat (or evade) the Kanian soldiers and other foes you\u2019ll encounter, avoid obstacles, and face that minion at the end. There are checkpoints that appeared in each level along the way. Once the boss is defeated, a glowing orb appears for you to touch, and then you\u2019ll have a Level Completed screen where you\u2019ll have the option of either retrying the level you completed or move on to the next.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0At the start of each level, you\u2019ll shoot enemies with colored Finger Shooter projectiles by default with an attack damage of 1, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can use them all the time. There are weapon power ups that scatter throughout the Kingdom. There are twelve of them and when you grab that weapon power up, not only you\u2019ll get that new weapon projectile, but you\u2019ll also change your appearance as well depending on that weapon power up you got.</p>\n<p>\u00a0At the game start, you\u2019ll have five lives with zero acorns collected. Once you lose all five, you\u2019ll have a Game Over screen, and you have the option of either retry or quit to main menu. There are a number of ways to gain an extra life:</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>Collect 500 acorns,\u00a0\r\n  </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Get 50,000 points, or\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Grab an Extra Life Pickup\u00a0</em></strong></li></ul>\n<p>And if you ever get lost or have any questions, you can check out the game's official Guide Book that comes included!
