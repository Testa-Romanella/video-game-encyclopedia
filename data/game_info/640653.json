The goal is to push the other player off the platform and not fall. The game then resets and loops forever. There are four maps in this game mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>100-second survival</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>...is played single-player. You need to survive enemies that try to push you off the platform. After 100 seconds of surviving, the golden ball is unlocked, and in order to win you need to touch it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a lot more plans for this game but this is my main goal.
