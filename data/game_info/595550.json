They dig their tunnels deeper and deeper into our soft heart. We must stop them, oh yes, we must.</p>\n<p>Explode them. Burn them in sizzling lava. Poison them with gas. Unleash beasts upon them. Do whatever it takes to stop them in their tracks. They cannot have our gems, oh no, they cannot.</p>\n<p>The swarm is endless, so we must kill as many as we can to slow them down. Eventually, we will succumb. But first, we will fight.</p>\n<p>Right-click dwarves to see their intentions.
