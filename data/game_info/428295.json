Play as Morgan, an impulsive, yet curious, wizard whose experiments often get him into trouble. This time, a cloning spell has backfired and his duplicates have run off with most of his magic. You must now chase them through three enchanted levels of a warped, Renaissance-inspired city. Manipulate your environment with telekinesis and time stop/reversal powers to overcome obstacles put before you by the dastardly clones. When you catch up to them, defeat them in battle to regain your powers. Developed by Desert Beagle Studios as an 8-month long student project.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T14:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93dc974754ca72c84e40b53cfae6bc9d.jpg", "website": "http://maledictiongame.wixsite.com/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Desert Beagle Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FIEA"], "esrb_rating": null}
