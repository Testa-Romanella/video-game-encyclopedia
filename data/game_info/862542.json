{"id": 862542, "slug": "candy-eden", "name": "Candy Eden", "name_original": "Candy Eden", "description": "<p>Candy Eden is a game about... candies. You find yourself in a candy-land and fight through hordes of sentient deserts.</p>\n<p>You have abilities on your left and right mouse clicks and 2 passive ones that activates by some trigger (like cooldown). Of course in <strong>every 10 seconds</strong> an event card is drawn and some random stuff happens! You can gain more abilities to switch your ability bar, go into SUGAR RUSH BY EATING A LOT OF CANDY! or maybe even draw weirder cards.</p>\r\nAbilities\r\n<p>Each ability has an active and a passive effect. You can change your abilities by pressing 'Tab'. When an ability is equipped in passive slot, its passive effect is triggered automatically. There are 3 ways to activate passive abilities. Cooldown, when other ability activates or when you get hit. When an ability is in the active slot (mouse left or right) you can target enemies by clicking on them or if the ability doesn't target anything, you can just click \ud83d\ude09</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about abilities, you can hover over with your mouse to read their tooltips.</p>\r\nResources\r\n<p>Also, you have Health and Blood Sugar! When your health drops to 0, you die. When your blood sugar increases to 100, YOU GO CRAZY AND DEAL TONS OF DAMAGE AND POWER. You can also gain permanent power and shields, but <strong>we didn't have enough time to show them on UI \ud83d\ude25</strong></p>\n<p>Monsters throw candy at you but I got so annoyed by the candies thrown at my face, I added an option to disable that in the menu \ud83d\ude0b</p>\n<p>Anyway, have fun. Don't forget to pause the game if you feel lost. Any feedback is appreciated!</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>Pick one doesn't let you pick an ability after 2nd time its pulled.</li><li>Timers don't work sometimes, especially during the equipment of an ability.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left click: Ability 1</li><li>Right click: Ability 2</li><li>Tab: Ability inventory panel</li><li>P: Pause the game.</li><li>H: Cheat we left in.
