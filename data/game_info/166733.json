My first game, it's an action platformer inspired by my love of rats. This build is for testing and feedback purposes and has menus disabled. Now that the basic engine is built, I decided to publish this before I start working on the level design.</p><p>Currently, the menus have been disabled.There are some key combinations available for debugging purposes. Don't try to figure out what they are...</p><p>I plan on making the tutorial text more clear, and adding dialogues. The boss will also be more polished in many ways, and entering the boss' wall-hole will exit the first level and begin the second.</p><p>Right now you can still jump OOB near the boss. I didn't think it would be necessary to put a wall there yet, just know you will not find anything special over there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f880a00f6510ead8bb96746301fb850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["716green"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
