Everybody experiences depression\u00a0differently. This game is representative of one of my experiences. Maybe you'll relate to it, but maybe you won't, and either way is fine.</p>\n<p>Click on what you want to do. Press space to start the game, and press space to end the game. You choose when to end the game, and you may choose to do so\u00a0at any time. Maybe that's some sort of metaphor for how we get to choose how to spend our time (and how, in my opinion, we should be able to choose to spend our time doing things that make us happy), or maybe I just wanted to let you decide when you wanted to end the game and hear the nice song at the end.\u00a0You can press ESC or Q to quit the game entirely at any time.\u00a0The game is best played with sound. I prefer it with headphones in. That's up to you, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Please </strong>play the game with a screen resolution of <strong>1280x720</strong>. You can play it windowed, or not. I prefer it not windowed.</p>\n<p>The song at the end is by wonderful bedroom pop band\u00a0Adult Mom\u00a0and is used with their permission.</p>\n<p>Here are some songs that help me get out of bed and respond to emails when I'm not feeling up to it:</p>\n<ul><li>Maid of the Mist by Diet Cig</li><li>Hot Dad Calendar and Mesa\u00a0by Cayetana</li><li>I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers</li><li>Green Light by Lorde</li><li>The Feud and Everything I Own by The Front Bottoms</li></ul>\n\n<p>I'm about 3 months into a 6-month-long project where I'm making a bunch of games about being mentally ill. This isn't part of that project, it's just a game I started in late 2017 that I wanted to finish up and publish. If you're interested in learning more about that project, though, here's a link a blog post I did a while ago, where I talk some about the project. Feel free to email me, tweet at me, etc, if you have any thoughts\u00a0you'd like to share! :)</p>\n\n<p>btw, canvas is an educational website. my university uses it. it lets you know if there's a new assignment, grade, course announcement, etc!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b584debe2b0c8c6c215267e21c6d655b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Violet Elder"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
