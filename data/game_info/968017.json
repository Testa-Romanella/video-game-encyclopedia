{"id": 968017, "slug": "quadrilla", "name": "Quadrilla", "name_original": "Quadrilla", "description": "<strong>Quadrilla</strong> is an autoscrolling arcade game where you have to clear lines to get points and carve a path for yourself. Pick up blocks, arrange them in a line, get points. Sounds easy?<h3>Easy to grasp, hard to master! </h3>If you're not careful, unsupported blocks will fall. On your head? Lose a life. In a skillfully pre-planned spot? Big points.<h3>C-c-c-combo!</h3>Depending on line composition and how exactly you clear lines, you get different scores, multipliers and combos ( and most importantly : the announcer exclaims them ). Experiment and find out!<h3>In the zone</h3>While digging down you will also encounter different zones, with different types of blocks. Perhaps some can't be picked up, and others are fussy about their neighbors when clearing lines. Some will be dense and leave you scrambling to find a way to get out, others are good for getting the combo multiplier up.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T05:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea3667e696679b50d25225bb793d9d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heinn"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["heinn"], "esrb_rating": null}
