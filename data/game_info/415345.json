It's a space where Daniel\r\nCook has shared thoughts and exercises on game design.</p>\n<p>I've been wanting to\r\nimprove through intentional practise, so I decided to implement one of Daniel's\r\nsuggested designs. I picked the only prototype which won a gold award and\r\ndecided I'd try make my own version before playing the winning entry and then compare\r\nresults.<br/></p>\n<p>It's worth noting\r\nthat the entry was originally from 2008 so I feel like I've got a massive\r\nadvantage by using modern tools. In any event i found this a really useful\r\nexercise.</p>\n<p>You can find the\r\noriginal design description here.</p>\n\n<p>Things I did\r\ndifferently:</p>\n<ul> <li>From the outset I wanted to     have something that was playable with just one button. This meant that I     didn't implement the shop as laid out and instead went for items which are     statically placed in the world. Now there's no risk of losing your lure     and needing to repurchase it, I wonder if there's a way to introduce that     risk/reward.</li> <li>This isn't explicitly     mentioned in the design but I added an acceleration to the lure when     luring in. Having a static speed for the lure felt way more mechanical and     predictable in a this-isn't-good way. </li> <li>The original design required     fish to be matched to lure sizes. In my prototype I allow players to catch     smaller fish with a larger lure. During testing I found myself ignoring     the smaller fish as my larger lure dropped down. I found that letting     smaller critter grab the lure meant that I needed to pay more attention     while luring and that it added a meaningful choice of grabbing the first     easy fish or dodging down to go for bigger ones.</li> <li>While working on this I was     often surprised by how impactful animations speeds are. Particularly     during the \"scoring a fish\" phase, reducing some elements by     just 0.5 seconds changed the experience from frustrating waiting to steady     delight.</li> <li>Implementing fish rarity made     a massive difference to how fun this was for me. It took the game from     \"let me get the closest fish\" to \"what fish are nearby? ...     Which one should I aim for?\"</li> <li>The original design included     \"very large fish\" which weren't catchable but increased the risk     of losing your lure. I feel like that would have added some challenge to     this prototype but didn't get around to adding it.</li> <li>I'm not convinced about the     bomb lure. Blowing poor fish up feels a counter to life in the serene     world of fishing girl. I've included the bomb in this prototype but feel     like I didn't get it to a point where it adds to the gameplay.</li> <li>During playtesting I noticed     friends get frustrated when they were luring in a large fish and it was     constantly being nibbled by the small fish. I've changed the design so     that only medium fish can nibble on large ones now and there's much less     frustration. This keeps the tension (hah!) of needing to cautiously reel     in large fish but means there's far less frustration while doing it.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f10c27a42b5de2c650710b51a1aaec78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ashashza"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
