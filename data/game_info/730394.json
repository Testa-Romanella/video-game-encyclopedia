Something went terribly wrong with a science project and all animals from the Solar System keep getting teleported to space and alien environments. Please come and help us save our little friends! We provide a top of the line RP-72 Saucer - you get speed, dexterity and an automated Proximity Teleporter in one neat package. Sadly the warp drive is only capable of travelling to the Desert Planet but our buzzy Engineers are working around the clock to expand out rescue operation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T07:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d74d4a4f04df8cc8c19eef9068d559d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zultran"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
