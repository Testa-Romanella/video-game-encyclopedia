Master using your valuable dodge-roll to have a chance to survive!\u00a0If you finish the game, you can even fight against harder versions of the bosses to prove that you are worthy!</p>\n<p>This game is for Windows devices only.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I finished this version of the game in February of 2020. I don't plan on developing this game any further since I have moved on from GameMaker to Godot, though I may re-make this game in Godot at some point in the future. I still thought it might be a good idea to finally upload this game to itch.io and share it with the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c5acbe0f1d07a60935b77683aff903a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jenus358"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
