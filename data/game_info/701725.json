Game art was done in two ways:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 &gt;\u00a0The Menu, Characters and Ingredients were made in 2D.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 &gt;\u00a0The game's scenery was made in 3D in Blender and rendered to a static 2D image.</p>\n<ul><li>The biggest difficulty was maintaining the aesthetic similarity between characters and environment, so that the 2D would also look like a 3D OBJECT, so we pay a lot of attention to the light and shadow work of the digital handcrafted arts.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The ingredients were inspired by real fruits and, because they are colored, they were outlined in white to be able to stand out better in space, and provide better visualization by the player during the game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Some curiosities:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Symia means Alchemy in Turkish</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The duck originally didn't have a name, so since he has a stingray on his head we named it Claudia in honor of Claudia Raia (the name of a famous person in Brazil)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The Character Chuchulo, who despite not being a character he became a dear to me and Niko, was inspired by the work \u201cThe Call of Cthulhu\u00a0and another short story - by Love Craft\u201d, but in a cuter version.</li></ul>\n<p>\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u00a0\u00a0\u263c\u00a0\u00a0\u2591\u2591 \u2591</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Move</strong>Left and Right Arrow<strong>Put potion in the cauldron</strong>Spacebar<strong>Exit</strong>\r\nEsc\r\n\r\n<p><em>**Fullscream not adapted</em>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Mariane Aurora\u00a0- Art and Level Design:\u00a0Instagram\r\n</p>\n<p>Nicoly Lemes\u00a0- Coding and Art:\u00a0Itch.io\u00a0|\u00a0Artstation\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\r\n</p>\n<p>Felipe Rodrigues\u00a0 - Coding\r\n</p>\n<p>-\r\n</p>\n<p>The songs used in the game are <strong>free to use</strong>, taken from the <strong><em>Twin Musicom</em></strong> site.</p>\n<ul><li>Menu Screen - [ Spooky Ride ]</li><li> Gameplay - [ 8-bit March ]</li></ul>\n<p>-<br/></p>\n<p><em>made with C and Dev C++.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Other tools: Blender, Aseprite,\u00a0</em><em>Medibang Paint.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb06fbde345a76a41010692fd0041d2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nikopaah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
