That was the initial idea kernel. In the game, players must collect all of the food in the level with their bow and arrow and then land on the fire pit to \"cook\" the food.\u00a0I had this grandiose plan of having a lot of fun and unique interactions with the arrow\u00a0 and its skewered food; however, I realized a bit too late that a lot of those ideas really only worked in 3D. I had gotten too deep in development to turn back at that point, so I kept going with the 2D style I started. That being said, I definitely think there's <em>something</em> here with this 2D\u00a0prototype. I'm curious to dive a bit deeper into this concept after I've stepped away from it for a while. Ideas? Let me know lol</p>\r\nLeft-Click &amp;\u00a0DragFire off the arrowRight-ClickCancel an arrow firingNumbers 1 - 7Select levelRRestart the level", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c70/c70c068242b7fdf0a1bab187a79cfd46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
