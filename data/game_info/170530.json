(More info here:\u00a0https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=49317.0 )</p><p>Edit: For some reason I forgot to add this in, a month or two ago I tried and failed at making Tetris but there's a 90% chance I won't give up at a problem like that. back to it later. So it was a week(or two by now I guess) I tried again and succeeded. That's when this whole thing started.</p>\n<p>But then I thought about how there could be a really cool first person adventure experience based around Tetris... and I wonderful idea came to me.</p>\n<p>I originally wanted to have an island you explore, lore behind the different block shapes and a couple more surprises in a short game where you explore an island and overcome different challenges in the 4 temples around the island. While the island and temples are done(needs a couple finishing touches), I don't think I should be focusing too heavily on this side project.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The problem is I want to make this a really meaningful experience and I thought I could do that in a couple weeks. Week 1, I made incredible progress. I programmed Tetris, took the code I made for exploring used in\u00a0 Frog Days and put into a clean project and modeled the island. Given another week, I can get it done and satisfy my goals for it, but I don't think that's enough time to make a really meaningful spiritual Tetris adventure.</p>\n<p>So here's a small bit of what could have been! Very basic Tetris and 1 screen on an island...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17feee069e61d2b2b137085625ff9988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swordofkings128"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
