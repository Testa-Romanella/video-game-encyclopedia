It is still work in progress and has no real animations yet but I will continue working on it. My plan is to draw every asset by hand and also animate the characters in hand drawn animations. Also I want to include some items and different levels.\u00a0This is just the first prototype.</p>\n<p>Please let me know your feedback!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Use \"A\" for running to the left and \"D\" for running to the right. With\u00a0\"Space\" you can jump.\u00a0Avoid the little negativities in forms of small devils the white men throw at you and try to stay happy as long as you can. You have 3 lives before you get to unhappy and die (yes sounds dark.. haha).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/6295753cd718325bbd17348bf2aeda85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mo_dulo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
