Over the course of seven days, players control her breathing as she faces increasing levels of pollution in the city.</p>\n<p>I've been living in China for over a year now and while the city is great, the air pollution is a real issue that people deal with on a day-to-day basis. I made Hazy Day based on my own personal experiences and I hope that it can help put into perspective what it feels like to breathe in smog.</p>\n<p>China's air pollution levels are constantly covered in the media. With Hazy Days, I hope to humanize the issue so that the problem can be more relatable. Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f6120d41326be62977361b9a78da9dee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mike Ren"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
