{"id": 241048, "slug": "godzilla-save-the-earth", "name": "Godzilla Save the Earth", "name_original": "Godzilla Save the Earth", "description": "In the single-player game, G-Force scientists have cracked Godzilla's genetic code from samples obtained during the Vortaak invasion. Scientists have refined the code to grow super-enriched \"Godzilla-Matter\" -- a virtually indestructible substance with the exact physical properties as Godzilla's radioactive back spikes. The Vortaak learn of the Godzilla Matter and strike Monster Island in an attempt to steal G-Cells and seize control of Earth's monsters. As Godzilla, the player awakens and fights to stop the UFOs from stealing G-Cells, and to free his fellow monsters from captivity. Throughout the game's missions, Vorticia sends waves of monsters, UFOs, mind-controlled military and earth-threatening devices at Godzilla, who must fight to defeat the enemies and find the hidden G-Cells before the UFOs can steal them. The epic battle for Earth will range across the globe in more than a dozen massive, destructible city environments, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Osaka and New York. Features a variety of online multiplayer options for up to four players where gamers can smash, bash and trash opposing monsters and cities in gargantuan online melees. Player will be able to go head-to-head, three- or four-player free-for-all, or team up for two-on-two combat. Godzilla will face off against more than 18 classic Toho movie monsters, each carefully designed to recreate the authentic film look and feel. Monsters include Godzilla 2000 and 90s, King Ghidorah, Gigan, Mothra, SpaceGodzilla, Biollante and many more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-01T12:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d2042ba244768157d8ac8cbc74e1ab8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.67, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Pipeworks Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
