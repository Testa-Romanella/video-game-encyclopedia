Mark squares as alive by clicking on them (or select a starting shape from the menu).<br/>2. Choose a color scheme from the menu.<br/>3. Press the Start button to run the life simulation and see what happens.</p>\n<p><strong>TOOLS<br/></strong>Conway Color Life\u00a0was created using React and Typescript. You can see the source code on\u00a0GitHub. Feel free to fork and modify it as you see fit. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and was embedded within an Iframe and uploaded to Itch.io. For more info on how to get a React project working on Itch.io, take a look at\u00a0this article.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/>Make sure to mark some\u00a0squares as alive before starting the simulation (otherwise the simulation won't do anything).\u00a0You can mark a square as alive by clicking on it. Or you can add a shape from the dropdown to mark multiple squares as alive.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>TROUBLE PLAYING?</strong><br/>If you're having trouble playing the embedded version here on Itch.io, you can also\u00a0play Conway Color Life\u00a0on GitHub: <strong>PLAY ON GITHUB</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>EXAMPLES</strong><br/>Here's a few cool examples that I made. Please share any interesting patterns that you find! I'd love to see them!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T14:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/4707bedb70e7e105cb957ddaff4f0640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRealMattKain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
