The controls are quite simple, the player character simply moves towards the cursor every frame. Touch any red and you will be die. I recommend playing the game in fullscreen.</p>\n<p>The screen flashes a lot, so if you have problems with seizures, i got to recommend you to maybe pass on this game ^^.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is a submission for the gmtk game jam 2019.
