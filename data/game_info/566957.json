{"id": 566957, "slug": "core-guardians", "name": "Core Guardians", "name_original": "Core Guardians", "description": "<p>Developed by Solomon Agayatin</p><p>Core Guardians is a 2D,\u00a0top-down-shooter, arcade-type, PvP-offline-multiplayer, fighting game in which there's an arena split into two. The left side is where Player 1 is positioned and vice versa, Player 2 is on the right side. These sides are called zones and the players get to pick 1 Guardian (playable character) each to play in a match and duel each other in a top-down shooting type of game.</p><p>The purpose of the split-zones is that neither player can leave their zone and they are only allowed to shoot projectiles to each other from one zone to another, hitting and dodging, battling arcade-style. The goal is to use all your projectiles, abilities, items, moves, and upgrades to reduce your opponent's HP to 0, making you win the match.<br/></p><p>Created with Clickteam Fusion 2.5.</p>\n<p>The game has so many unique features:</p>\n<p>&gt; Different Guardians with different playstyle; 1 passive ability and 2 active abilities ranging from shooting powerful unique projectiles, applying debuffs to your opponent, applying buffs to yourself, healing, summoning units, and much more.</p>\n<p>&gt; Choose the right builds and items to take advantage in the match.</p>\n<p>&gt; Levels, Rage, Energy, Armor, and different crucial counters casual fighting games do not have.</p>\n<p>&gt; It has Barrels you can hide behind but not all the time.</p>\n<p>&gt; Experience a 1v1 fighting game where there's depth, stats, and complex mechanics for a simple concept of a game.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; READ &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>\n<p>Safety Awareness:</p>\n<p>\"If you are using Windows 10, Windows Defender might say something about the game being harmful but worry not. This case is normal to most stand-alone Windows applications built by Clickteam Fusion 2.5. It's common to most of us developers\u00a0who are using this engine. I assure you that Core Guardians.exe does not contain anything to harm your device. Windows Defender just kindof really hates Clickteam Fusion 2.5 apps. This is a message from the developer himself, Solomon. Enjoy playing!\"</p>\n<p>- This message is within the game folder inside the 'Read me' text file. The developer assures you that the file is safe and will not cause your device any harm. As you download the game file through this website and your browser tells you that it may be harmful and asks you to Discard or Keep it, there is nothing to be worried about. If you still wish to play, click 'Keep' and don't worry,\u00a0the game is not harmful. I repeat, this is a common issue with Clickteam Fusion but the file is NOT harmful. -</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>\n<p>Developer - Solomon Agayatin - says:</p>\n<p>Hi! This is the first game I have ever created and I will be making updates in the future to add more characters, content, and gameplay changes to improve the game overall.
