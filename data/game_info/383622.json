For example, would you help a merchant back on their feet and make a new friend, but potentially lose out on a profitable deal, or ignore their cries for help to make sure you come out on top? Would you smuggle illicit goods for some easy coins, despite the negative effects it could have on a town's inhabitants? As you make these choices, you are also pitted against time to save a loved one, creating a sense of urgency to amass as many coins as possible.<br/><br/><strong>Bartering System</strong> - More than just buying and selling with currency, Ten Thousand Coins features a system where you can barter goods directly with other traders. Depending on the trader's mood and what each trader needs, different items can have a higher value, therefore knowing what item to offer and when to offer them is the key to a successful trade.<br/><br/><h3>Features Include:</h3><br/><ul><li>An immersive and character-focused storyline.<br/></li><li>Make tough choices between altruism and materialism.<br/></li><li>Various colourful characters and side stories to discover and complete to further build the world's narrative.<br/></li><li>Many cities and towns to explore, trade, and build a reputation with.<br/></li><li>A crisp hand-drawn anime-inspired art style. <br/></li><li>Hundreds of unique items to use and trade.<br/></li><li>Random encounters in the wilderness and challenging enemies to battle against.<br/></li><li>Hire various convoys to aid you on your adventure.<br/></li><li>Multiple story endings depending on choices made throughout the story.<br/></li><li>Two different game modes: Story Mode and Challenge Mode.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T03:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6e98fd7fdfa07c681405596004dce3a.jpg", "website": "https://www.tenthousandcoins.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 486, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TL-TONIC"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TL-TONIC"], "esrb_rating": null}
