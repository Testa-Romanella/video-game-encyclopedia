(We changed our name from \"GouLauTong\" to \"YauYuenTong.\")<br/>Our second work, \"Fleeting Summer's end\" received positive reviews from many players.<br/>Before the release of FSE, we were full of anxiety.<br/>The results, be it the game's rating or the peripheral sales, though not outstanding, were much better than we initially anticipated.<br/><br/>We believe that Yuri (lesbian) games have a certain \"public good\" nature.<br/>Like how anyone can freely use a \"library\" as a \"public good,\" now, anyone can watch our works on platforms like Bilibili, and anyone can even download our works from some pirated game sites.<br/>All narrative-focused works (including but not limited to Anime, Comic, Games, Novel) seem to have become something with a certain \"public good\" nature, whether the authors are willing or not.<br/><br/>Even so... just as many people are willing to pay taxes or donate to the government for the construction of libraries, many Yuri players are willing to consume our works to support our continued creation.<br/>Therefore, the support of these players is very, very precious for us.<br/><br/>In the past year or so, the members of the production team have been busy and mentally exhausted due to their real-life responsibilities.<br/>2023 has been a special year for us, and the time and energy we can invest in the new game production have become even less.<br/>However, because of your support for \"Tinheung &amp; Sayuri\" and \"Fleeting Summer's End,\" because of your expectations for our new work, \"Chanye<br/>s home\" was born under extremely difficult circumstances.<br/><br/>It's because of you that this work exists.<br/>Thank you very much!<br/><br/>Although the overall quality of the work is inevitably limited by our time and money we believe that within a certain timeframe, using extremely limited resources, we have tried our best to tell the story of the encounter between Lam ChoTung and Lam Chanye.<br/><br/>Of course, there are inevitably some regrets in the work. If possible, please criticize us with gentleness.<br/><br/>The estimated playtime for this work is 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>If all goes well, we will start producing a work with a higher scale and playability. This not only requires a significant amount of time and effort from us but also relies on your support and encouragement.<br/>Hope to see you in the next work!<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>\u591a\u8b1d\uff01", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T05:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53eadcfe8d61a327a8f3b64fcb6e825b.jpg", "website": "https://space.bilibili.com/697701932", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u67da\u539f\u5802"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u67da\u539f\u5802"], "esrb_rating": null}
