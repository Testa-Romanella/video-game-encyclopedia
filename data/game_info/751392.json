You have a giant health bar and deal enormous damage; the hero is a puny human. This should be easy right?</p><p>WASD Keys to move.<br/>If you have a controller plugged in, it will control the hero (so you can play against a friend, though you don't die yet so \ud83e\udd37)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Bevy game jam #1</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam is \"Unfair Advantage\".</p><p>This is very in progress and not really playable. Ran out of time for the game jam. Art is my own (and thus crappy lol).<br/></p><p><strong>Bugs/missing features:</strong></p><p>- You can't attack currently\u00a0<br/>- You never die<br/>- The hero \"teleports\" behind you instead of rolling\u00a0because of a bug with using the wrong\u00a0animation frame<br/>- The sprites are ordered wrong (boss goes underneath everything when he should be on top), only happened on\u00a0web builds so\u00a0\u00a0I didn't notice in time<br/>- Screenshake isn't working \ud83d\ude2d. Another issue with the web build because I\u00a0was using a noise library that didn't support WASM, had to pull it to get an upload in time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T07:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be7/be7152dadd67ea8509db94db281d638c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["prawl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
