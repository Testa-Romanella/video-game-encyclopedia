As a result, this game\u00a0attempts to follow a ZZT aesthetic that belongs to that time. Back then, tools to extend ZZT's graphical palette were beginning to\u00a0be available\u00a0among the ZZT community.\u00a0 It was not uncommon to see game worlds start out being drawn\u00a0with the colours accessible from ZZT's built-in editor, and later on get a (subjective) graphical boost as the authors discovered they could do more.</p>\n<p><strong>Photosensitivity warning:</strong> This game contains a number of animations with flashing effects. Players sensitive to these are warned. Most can be bypassed by moving through passages (\u00a0\u2261 symbols on coloured backgrounds) where possible.</p>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n<p>Move with the arrow keys. You can shoot using either Shift+the direction you want to fire, or with the spacebar. Interact with objects by touching them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More specific instructions are provided within the game. You pass between stages by entering passages (the white\u00a0\u2261 symbols on coloured backgrounds).</p>\n<p>If the game runs slowly, try increasing the speed on the title screen or try playing it at a different time.<br/></p>\r\nPlaying the game offline\r\n<p>The download contains the ZZT world you're playing now, MSBIAv12.ZZT, as well as an older version of the game, MSBIA.ZZT.\u00a0These will require ZZT or the Reconstruction of ZZT to run in Zeta. ZZT can be found on the Museum of ZZT at\u00a0 https://museumofzzt.com/, while Zeta and the Reconstruction are available at https://zeta.asie.pl/. Unzip\u00a0 the download into a folder containing these to play.</p>\n<p>While\u00a0 the game can be played with ZZT in DOSBox, it hasn't been extensively tested in it.\u00a0You may need to set the number of\u00a0cycles to max in DOSBox and/or increase the game speed (accessible from the title screen) to get it to run smoothly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f5fe30f9f7340f4bab494d40065dc2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PogeSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
