The theme I wanted to focus on is job hunting, since that's what's occupying most of my time (as of this game's release date). It's a bit of therapy for myself, to be honest, so I can start working on my next project with a clear mind.</p>\n<p>STORY:<br/>You're a writer who lost their job during the pandemic of 202X. Find a new job before you run out of money or pass out from exhaustion.<br/><br/>CONTENT WARNINGS:\u00a0<br/>- Depictions of Anxiety and Depression<br/>There are two secret battles in this game that simulate depression and anxiety as RPG battles.
