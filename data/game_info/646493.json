All three types of Phoenixes can light candles,</p>\n<p>and each Phoenix type has a unique ability and traits:</p>\n<ul><li>Classic Phoenix: can dash. Use this to traverse gaps and safely pass through water. Has decent jump height.</li><li>Little Phoenix: can perform a super jump. Regular jump is slightly higher than the other types.</li><li>Big Phoenix: can perform a flame punch that can break wooden barriers. Can hardly jump.</li></ul>\n<p>Every type of Phoenix can also perform a \"Peaceful Rest\". This simply drains all your life force and causes you to die immediately.</p>\n<p>Use this if you want to resurrect as another type of Phoenix without performing specific actions.</p>\n<p>Each death reduces your number of lives by one (lives are represented by the smaller squares top left). Running out of lives causes you to perish indefinitely and results in a loss.</p>\n<p>Water and water streams can also cause you to perish should you make contact with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:43:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0d76597704d63862f000751aa09716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gamecoder95"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
