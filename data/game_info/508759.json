As you float down, gather the color from the clouds and dodge the space debris. If you get hit, you will lose color and shrink your score bonus. When you land on the landing pad, you are able to deposit any color you have on your space ship and gain extra points. It is kind of buggy, I may come back and develop it further if anyone likes it.</p>\n\n<p>-Arrows to move left and right, Space bar to collect colors.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7d/c7d7a208d531951e454991c032e14ae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueBeard22"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
