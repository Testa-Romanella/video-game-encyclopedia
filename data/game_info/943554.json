This was created purely from an artistic vision. No prior mathematical knowledge is required to play this game, allowing players to effortlessly create intensely cinematic scenes. The implementation of an automatic randomized system creator feature was made to assist the creative process and offer new never-before-seen systems on command. Additional system variables beyond three dimensions offer endless opportunities for experimentation and discovery.<br/><br/><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li> Predefined Systems </li></ul><ul><li> Customizable Systems </li></ul><ul><li> Automatic Randomized System Creator </li></ul><ul><li> Additional System Variables, Beyond 3 dimensions </li></ul><ul><li> Customizable Color Schemes </li></ul><ul><li> Saving Systems </li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T03:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c72c1fa8f1248ce12f83b9adf71a140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poof"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Poof"], "esrb_rating": null}
