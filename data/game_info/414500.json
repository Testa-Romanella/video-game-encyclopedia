The Jam's theme was: \"Holes\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>The game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is all about helping photons in space to avoid black holes to ensure that future television, which is broadcasted with an array of photons (as everybody knows...), keeps being a thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The GPTV(Galactic Photon Television)-Company has invented an amazing technology:</p>\n<p>The so called 'black hole device' can be used to create artificial black holes. Use their gravity wisely and pull your photons away from the \"bad guys\"...</p>\n<p>Upgrade your hole device and your batteries, you will need the extra power in order to avoid the bigger and therefore more influential holes.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know it's not a whole lot here, but we would be happy to get some feedback on our work.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Have fun and thank you for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef9/ef99e0b60cf56da03a699342ed5286bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SayOze"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
