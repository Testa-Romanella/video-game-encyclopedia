{"id": 50671, "slug": "cultist-simulator", "name": "Cultist Simulator", "name_original": "Cultist Simulator", "description": "<p>Seize forbidden treasures. Summon alien gods. Feed on your disciples.<br />\nCultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning from Alexis Kennedy, creator of Fallen London and Sunless Sea. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you&#39;re looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.<br />\nIn this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn&#39;t just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.<br />\nBecome a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.<br />\nKey features:<br />\nCombine cards to tell your own story in a rich, Lovecraftian world of ambition, appetite and abomination. Corrupt your friends. Consume your enemies. There is never only one history.<br />\nFound a cult, dedicated to the Red Grail, or the Witch-and-Sister, or the Forge of Days. Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat&#39;s-paws. Use your disciples to keep you fed - or feed on your disciples.<br />\nUnravel arcane, unacknowledged mysteries. Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Locate and pillage the Star Shattered Fane. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus.<br />\nOutwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities. Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped.<br />\nTranscend death with a story-driven legacy system. Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they&#39;ll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they&#39;ll bring the Dawn.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-27T15:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ec5/ec58c8b204da0d48448e7c2d148d0110.jpg", "website": "http://www.cultistsimulator.com", "rating": 3.46, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 121, "owned": 1224, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 43, "dropped": 97, "playing": 24}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 78, "ratings_count": 162, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 167, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Playdigious", "Weather Factory"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playdigious", "Weather Factory"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
