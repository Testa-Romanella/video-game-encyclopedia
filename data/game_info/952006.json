Your inventory can only hold 10 items so it will be wise to use the most effective weapons later in the game.<br/><br/>Each level is a chase sequence, where you run away from the emerging 4 suns in the solar system through over 20+ levels. Shooting knocks them back but it only makes them come back stronger.<br/><br/>Prepare to die alot with lots of challenging bosses to fight, each with their own gimmick.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T03:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37fb3e683ca8c7da7a042b8cef9f94b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["SpaceGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
