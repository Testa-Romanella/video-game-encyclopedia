Race through 10 15 levels shooting nasties and collecting bonuses in an overhead perspective. Three Four different weapons, three different enemy types, four focus abilities and tight difficulty (remember, you can't jump while reloading!!).\r\n</p>\n<p>As requested by the Jam Rules, the game is based off a 90s movie (The Mummy... General ambiance and abundance of shooting things), has two endings (depending on your performance) and tells you everything you need to know in the title screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has been made in C++ with the SDL2 library and some custom libraries to add a minimal framework.\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional credits for sounds and tiles in the title screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy the ugly programmer artwork and the full screen pictures I took on my vacation ;). <br/></p>\n<p>Inexplicably, this game got an update years later with more levels, weapons and gameplay systems. There may be further patches making the levels just a bit more palatable, but enough is enough :).<br/></p>\n<p>Get the source at https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/familiar-temple-fgj4\r\n</p>\n<p>#action\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d0928abb696cc6a0ce2deadc3fc3351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Marlboro Man"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
