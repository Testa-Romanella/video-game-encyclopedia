Guess the words from the pictures shown, then find them in the word search.<br/><br/>Here's an example. You see a picture of a fire and a picture of an engine.  What's the word?  Fire-engine!<br/><br/>If you need help guessing a word, you can easily reveal it by swiping up on the pictures.  To view the different pictures, simply swipe them left and right.  To highlight a word in the word search, drag your finger from the first letter of the word to the final letter of the word to select it.<br/><br/>The pictures used in this game were kindly donated for public use at openclipart.org  Thanks to all the artists for making this game possible!
