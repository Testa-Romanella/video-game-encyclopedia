Single player mode is keyboard friendly, though I would recommend using a gamepad anyway. I have extensively tested this in single player and have tested the 2nd player functionality using gamepad 2 but unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to give it a full on test of 2 players at once through the 2 stages.</p>\n<p>I recommend closing steam and killing it in task manager since some controller configurations steam has interferes with the gamepads by binding keyboard and mouse functions to the controllers.</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be appreciated, especially if you can test 2 player mode with a friend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/04219bed6fb5b1117fece6c4ef719d27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MidgardianGamesLLC"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
