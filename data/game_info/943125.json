It's a mix between <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Griftland</em>.\u00a0 Sadly, we did not manage to integrate all the main elements of gameplay but we will update it in the near future to a better state. You can still see random items (which affects how many points the card make with a variety of conditions), random card draw and a functionning point system allowing to put random win objective to the player. The game is about using cards (representing actions taken as a minimum wage worker in a walmart-type store) to keep the meters above or below certain thresholds (those ovjectives would be give at the beginning of the day). Throughout the day, annoying customers would come and disrupt your gameplan by asking for side objective or messing with your meters in specific ways. At the end of the day, if you managed to complete the aforementioned conditions, you would progress to a harder day (by having harder thresholds, weaker cards, etc).
