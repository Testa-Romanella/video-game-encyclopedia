Problems I plan to fix will\u00a0be listed here:</p>\n<p>- the player can't shoot to the left of them</p>\n<p>- there are no game states so when you die, you have to refresh the page to play again</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to the character around the playing area and try to survive as long as possible. Left click of the mouse shoots bullets that kills the enemies.</p>\n<p>I have a google form that would be appreciated if you could fill out while playing or afterwards, that would be great :)\u00a0\u00a0Comments are more than welcome in the comment section below!\r\n</p>\n<p>google form link -\u00a0https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsLQ_CTmtKJtEo4YGlVAMkraH97Aus1Bt2KwDM...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c21753a10c3518d90f682cb21d9d17da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcusTurnerBSU"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
