Player discretion is advised!\r\n\r\nABOUT\r\n<p>Play as a\u00a0nimble neon rabbit as you glide through the air slashing blocks, collecting carrots, care packages, and roaming through space in this fast-paced\u00a0arcade-style hack-and-slash platformer! Beware, however, of any red-colored blocks or packages, and don't let your jump meter run out!!</p>\r\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>* Gamepad is recommended *</p>\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\n<ul><li>The closer to the bottom of the screen blocks are, the more points they are worth</li><li>Try holding down the jump button for long jumps!</li><li>For each GREEN block you slash without jumping you increase your point multiplier (1 block = 1x, 2 blocks = 2x, 3 blocks = 3x, etc). Hitting RED blocks will also kill your multiplier.</li><li>The best way to rack up big point totals is to slash blocks from UNDERNEATH. Slashing from above will kill your vertical momentum, but slashing from underneath will not!</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was made in just under a total of 16 hours for the\u00a0Amaze Me Game Jam,\u00a0If you enjoy this game please consider rating it!\u00a0</p>\n\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<ul><li>Music, SFX, Gameplay / Programming, and Art made by Me</li><li>Additional sounds by:\u00a0Fesliyan Studios</li><li>Input system by:\u00a0Shortbread</li><li>Circular health bar by\u00a0Anixias</li><li>Blur shader by\u00a0XOR</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce620f188a9de18ab8669c37f48fc37d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gizmo199"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
