{"id": 36, "slug": "tekken-7", "name": "TEKKEN 7", "name_original": "TEKKEN 7", "description": "<p>Tekken 7 is a fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is the ninth installment in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>An unnamed journalist investigates the Mishima family history after his family got killed in a war that was started by Jin Kazama. In his investigation, the journalist tries to find out why did Jin&#39;s grandfather kill his own wife and threw his son Kazuya down the cliff. At the same time, Jin goes into hiding after defeating an ancient demon named Azazel while his grandfather takes over Mishima Zaibatsu. The world war goes on.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Just like the previous games in the series (apart from Tekken Tag Tournament 1 &amp; 2), Tekken 7&#39;s gameplay revolves around one-on-one hand-to-hand fights. </p>\n<p>Players are free to choose one of 43 playable characters. Every character has their own personal list of attacks and combos and drastically differs in play style.</p>\n<p>Several new additions were made to the game&#39;s combat system. Players can now use devastating hits that will take from 40 to 80 percent of the enemy&#39;s health if the player&#39;s health drops too low. Moreover, the players are able to use a Rage Drive. It allows for performing a special hit on a high speed that inflicts major damage to the enemy. The last new addition is Power Crush. This feature lets the players attack their opponent even when they&#39;re under attack. Players can&#39;t block their enemies low kicks while using the Power Crush.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2015-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T14:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/62b/62b035add7205737540d66e082b85930.jpg", "website": "http://www.bandainamcogames.com/", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 98, "owned": 2989, "beaten": 385, "toplay": 97, "dropped": 262, "playing": 122}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 295, "ratings_count": 744, "suggestions_count": 666, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 752, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America", "Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
