Feedback and insights from testers during development will be critical. So, if you are interested, suggestions and opinions will be great for us!</p>\n<p><strong>|Setting</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>It is a contemporary fantasy world, a society like ours, but based on magic instead of technology as if Lord of the Rings or D&amp;D took place in the 21st century instead of the Middle Ages. In this world, Essence or pure/neutral magic can be transformed into any energy and thus act on the environment and objects. Seeking it has been the main quest of human beings ever since they first discovered that, by using it, they could fan a flame, extinguish it, or touch it with their bare hands. This has led humanity to unprecedented progress, to the hyper-exploitation of magic, which causes natural catastrophes, magical plagues, inflation of currencies, difficult access to housing, vices of the culture of productivism, etc. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>|Story </strong><br/></p>\n<p>The protagonist is a wannabe hero who grew up listening to legends about adventure, glories, and epic tales, and dreamed all his life of living up to those standards. Worse, he was told that, if he dreamed hard enough, tried hard enough, or were as talented as the heroes of those tales, he would be lord and master of his destiny. But adulthood came and, with it, the certainty that the stories omitted... some details... <br/></p>\n<p>...the life of a regular adventurer isn't as epic and great as it was told. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>|Game Goals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The main aim of the game is  to make the hero survive day-to-day life in this modern magical society.  To do so, the player must balance the character's life between the  adventurer's work, leisure, and social life, maintaining his mental  health in the process. Keeping anxiety, depression, and stress at bay  while maintaining his economic \u201cindependence\u201d will be the real  challenge. The point is to develop one or more of life\u2019s achievements  such as having a family, writing a book, finding happiness in your work,  or simply having a cat.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>|Game Logic <br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game will have two complementary stages that will affect each other: a social one (the character's personal life) and a dungeon-like one (work-life). The main issue is to balance the character's Bars of Beeds to survive, this is Anxiety, Alienation, Physical Extenuation, Insecurity, Demotivation, Injuries, Hunger, Sleep, etc. Those bars will alert the player when a critical point has been reached. <br/></p>\n<p>On one hand, the social scenario aims to immerse in the character's life and develop his or her personal and social goals, which are a fundamental part of everyone's life.</p>\n<p>For the dungeon part, the player will have a rope/liana that will allow the player to traverse the dungeon with a focus on mobility and precise control of the character and magic abilities to fight or escape the creatures that are created by the excessive use of magic.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Join Our Discord Community!\u00a0</p>\n<p>[\u00a0https://discord.gg/2P7xEaHhcs\u00a0]\u00a0<br/></p><p>Could u respond to this little poll real quick?
