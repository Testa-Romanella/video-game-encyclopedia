You don't know who you are or what you are, but you have to fallow the arrow above your head, and you have very little time.</p>\n<p>This is a short 2D platformer that is very difficult and is five levels long. You need to make it to the goal, but you only start with 15 seconds. You need to collect little items to give you more time. This is the first game I made and hope to make many more.</p>\n<p>My YouTube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UCVQWLsV-J4YvhmvQf8xYf4w</p>\n<p>My Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/HumantmThe?s=09</p>\n<p>My Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb_vDHzrsGC/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=</p>\n<p>Lia, voice of Bo's YouTube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UClLSy8fn-1NXMxuz2RH6CCw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddc/ddc3877c436ef50fc5e7345d53858998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["A Very Random Guy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
