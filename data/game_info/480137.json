To proceed to next level you need to collect required no of coins as shown on your screen. Collecting coins isn't easy since there are enemies around which when comes in contact with the ball ,destroys it. Be extra\u00a0careful since these enemies can follow you and spawn anywhere randomly upon the ball. These enemies\u00a0get self destructed on colliding with other enemies. To add to the adventure of the game, I have given each coin and enemy a lifespan of 10 seconds\u00a0, so you better be fast in collecting those coins.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is my first attempt towards game development, hope you enjoy playing.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90d70ee7c9f96c021068f4b6acb2db2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sarvesh Khetan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
