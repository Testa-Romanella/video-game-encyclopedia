I am currently re-writing the custom \"gravity\" hack used in this game, and will submit it to the bitsy-hecks project when it is stable enough for others to use. Feel free to leave a comment if you are interested in how any of the other hacks were achieved :&gt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/934fa15a760ae1db19435877461af4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cole Sea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
