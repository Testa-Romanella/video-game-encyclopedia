Unlike other games, 3:21 doesn't aim to progressively become more challenging, (neither through mechanics or difficulty) instead it evolves through player progression and the challenges give way to a maturing story-telling system. Through the player's interactions with these basic functioning adventure programs that serve as a timeline of events, they discover what 3:21 is really about and just how real games can get.<br/></p>\r\nWhy is it FREE?\r\n<p>The game was developed to bring awareness to Winston's Wish, a UK-based charity that supports bereaved children.\u00a0Following the passing of a close family member, who worked as a senior programmer at Creative Assembly, Franco began developing 3:21 as a homage.</p>\n<p>The team has worked nearly 3 years on this project and really appreciates donations on our JustGiving page which supports Winston's Wish:\u00a0justgiving.com/fundraising/threetwentyone</p>\n<p>If you want to support our cause then you have multiple options available:</p>\n<p>1.
