Long ago, humanity settled other planets in the galaxy, and later on, these colonies would claim independence from Earth and its ruler. Now, Earth wants its colonies back... sparking conflict throughout the Solar System.<br/>Now these various planets, ruled by Supremes, fight each other in a constant battle for galactic domination. Supremes are essentially autocrats ruling their respective planets - but in order to do so, they require assistance. This assistance is provided by their advisors - such as You.<br/><br/><strong>GUIDE YOUR RULER</strong><br/>Each faction in the game has its own Leader - one that you must guide to victory over the other factions. The Supreme will listen to your advices, so make them count - know when to give your blessing to an invasion, and when to hold your Leader back. Each Leader has their own personality, affecting what actions they are more likely to inquire you about.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>PREPARE FOR BATTLES</strong><br/>In <strong>Galactic Counselors,</strong> hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers will march to their deaths on many galactic battlefields. Sometimes, a steady stream of footsoldiers as cannon fodder might earn a faction its victory, but if the enemy brings forth their mighty mechas or perhaps unleashes an orbital bombardment, the tide might turn in their favor. Your advices also matter in warfare, but remember - you are not a commander. Thus, you can guide your Leader into using the right strategy, but once the fighting begins, you must sit back and watch as he either brings home a victory or completely decimates your factions' armies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Four playable Factions<br/></li><li>Four Leaders, each with their own personality to alter gameplay<br/></li><li>Battles with hundreds upon hundreds of units<br/></li><li>Different biomes for planetary battles<br/></li><li>Achievements and statistics at the end of a game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T10:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c82c8b0c9a73f5773196d7626384581.jpg", "website": "https://acrogamesfin.com/366-2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AcroGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["AcroGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
