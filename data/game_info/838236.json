All that you can do is place blocks in order to steer the robot into the correct direction. Can you get a new highscore, or will your robot be plunged into the realm of eternal pain and suffering? (or is it really not that deep?) Why not play and find out?</p>\n<p>Controls: Left click to place a block!<br/></p>\n<p>Hints: The upper side of the block is the best to jump off so try to put a block where the robot is going to come down, and try to place blocks in advance!</p>\n<p><strong>Have Fun! I hope that you enjoy it! It's really hard, too so don't be discouraged if you fail a lot!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>A game by Oliver,\u00a0 Age 13<br/></p>\n<p>Thumbnail made by: https://www.craiyon.com/ - An AI text to image converter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dcaeea0d81adef15dc5e643297564d46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["OssoAce"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
