The main character of the game is a coke-addicted guy. He becomes obsessed with Coke's sugar, carbonation, and coca (early Coke contained coca). He repeatedly drinks large amounts of Coke to escape his less-than-ideal reality, eventually creating hallucinations. Players must defeat the monster in the Coke hallucination maze by throwing bottles to find the exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/167878c9c3b1bcf1cebe3c3c19adb6d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ayaka_xuan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
