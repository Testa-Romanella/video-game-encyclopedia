This game chronicles the events of a single week, from Monday to Sunday, in which each day brings a new challenge and even some new friends! There is never a dull moment when working for this fire station! That is for sure!</p>\n<p>History: Inspired by my godson's love for firefighting, it was originally meant to be in Finnish entirely, but plans changed quite a bit and while the content is obviously very kid-friendly, the gameplay might not be suitable for a 4-year-old. In lieu of that, hopefully older people will find this project interesting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d3735de97012a35549d3d8fe4911cbcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StefanosM"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
