Become a winner by finishing your cards before the beast in your palm. It keeps you comfort when it's needed and your mind focused when you are idle. The artificial intelligence keeps it challenging all the time.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>To play Naija Whot is not difficult. <br/>We have two decks: Market and Played decks.<br/>When it is your turn, you must drop  a card that is of same type(Image) or same number with the card played by your opponent. For instance, if your opponent drop Triangle11, you can either play a Triangle irrespective of the card number or you play any other card with same number(11). If you don't have any matching card to play, you must pick a card from the MARKET DECK.<br/>A player who first finish his cards is declared winner.<br/><br/>Apart from the above scenario, we have some ACTION CARDS. The action cards are: <br/>1. Hold On = any card with number(1).  It puts every player on hold thereby giving you opportunity to play again.<br/>2. Pick Two = any card with number(2). The next player can either defend the card or  pick two cards from market deck.<br/>3. Pick Three = any card with number(5). The next player can either defend the card or  pick three cards from market deck.<br/>4. General Market = any card with number(14). All the player except the player who dropped the card must pick one card from market deck.<br/>5. Suspension = any card with number(8). Suspends the next player.<br/>6. Crown = any card with number(20). Request any card of your choice.<br/>The above configuration is by default. They can be changed to any number of your choice.<br/><br/>In TOURNAMENT,  when  game ends, cards are counted and a player with the highest number is eliminated.<br/><br/>CRITICAL RULE<br/>Star card face value is always doubled during card counting. For examples:<br/>* Star1 = 2<br/>* Star2 = 4<br/>* Star3 = 6<br/>* Star4 = 8<br/>* Star5 = 10<br/>* Star7 = 14<br/>* Star8 = 16<br/>TIP: Avoid keeping STAR cards during tournament.<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/><br/>**QuickPlay mode --- our old style.
