I built everything from scratch using Unity C#, Maya, Photoshop, and Substance Painter.</p>\n<p>The game is played in two phases: the shop phase, where you can spend loot to replace the \"adornments\" in your dungeon, and the combat phase, where adventurers come and try to steal loot from you. There are three types of adornments: minions, traps, and supports. Try and combine different adornments to make the strongest dungeon ever! And watch out for those Goblin Sappers...</p>\n<p>There's no \"win\" condition or \"lose\" condition currently, but a fair win condition I'd say is making it to 50 gold, and a lose condition is if you get in the red. Go ahead and Alt+F4 and start over if you like, or keep playing from where you are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions or problems, and I'll work some more on this if I have the opportunity! Thanks for taking the time to try it out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c68e26b4c77e571a1b8d4b0536699f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["caxtnova"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
