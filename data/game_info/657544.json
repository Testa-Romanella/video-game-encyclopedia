Don't forget to check the developer blog to know what's been changed and what will be changed as well as adding some suggestions!</strong></p><p><strong>The gist</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Player controls an Archon with four diverse spells and four\u00a0 upgrades to choose from. Battle wave after wave of foes in a classic, action-packed arena. Use your magicka to launch spells and upgrade yourself as it becomes apparent you'll need every ounce of strength to defeat each boss who dares challenge you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Lore</p>\n<p><strong>In the beginning, The Coven used their magic to help all of humanity. Where some saw miracles, others saw profit. One by one, the witches who refused to give into the greed of the very people they were trying to save, were cast out with lies and ignorance.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It wasn't long before the Arcane Wars began. Caught off guard by the sheer number of vessels the humans could conjure, the Witches were barely able to congregate their forces at The Mentagicka Maxium or now known as The Last Library.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The humans knew they stood no chance against the Witches and summoned their own constructs to fight for them known as Archons. Powered by unwilling human souls, these Archons were no match for The Elite Archon who had the most powerful soul of all: that of the Grand Witch, freely given, with love and hope bursting from its core.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Now it is up to you, Elite Archon, to hold off the human abominations who are teleporting in with merciless numbers as The Witches evacuate their accumulated research and dwindling numbers.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>1. I'd suggest working on getting your magicka regen up as high as possible which means miss very few shots early on. Use Sudam (#3 skill) a lot as it 1-shots almost everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Fireball (#2 skill) is great if you're good at getting it close to groups without it actually hitting someone as its damage potential is enormous. It's perfect for wiping out groups of dudes but you'll need multiple shots.</p>\n<p>3. The main skill, Aram (#4 skill) is amazing for bosses since it can go full auto.</p>\n<p>4. The Shatter Cannon (#1 skill) does a lot of direct damage and even more aoe damage on impact. If you really need a group dead, this is your go-to but don't miss given how expensive it is.</p>\n<p>5. After wave 20, you get the javelin enemies. You can shoot down their missiles but watch out for the blue elite pylons which do tons of damage and steal magicka!</p>\n<p>More will be added so keep an eye on the dev logs!</p>\n<p>Made in one week by one person</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb35afaaa15c34e852bce9f31610efd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kage1129"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
