As you progress, based on the mass and velocity of the enemies, swarms of bubbles begin chasing you around.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is trully challenging game. You will get killed. It is hard and unforgiving. You do have a check-point after each chapter, but to reach that chapter you will need to master each level. So fear not if you need to try over and over.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ec/8ec458c1deef50a544ab50691dd7102f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["julien.villegas"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
