{"id": 713619, "slug": "maze-i", "name": "Maze I", "name_original": "Maze I", "description": "<p><em>One can look with their eyes wide open and don't see a thing.<br/></em><em>One can see everything without knowing what to do.<br/></em><em>One can learn what to do and try their very best.</em></p>\n<p><em>And it is possible to get into the Maze.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is some technical information on the game:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There isn't a save option available in the novel. Instead, the game auto-saves in the beginning of each chapter (it's when you can see the name of the chapter on the black screen). To continue playing from where you've left it, use the bookmark (If it's your first time playing the bookmark will send you to the first chapter). If you want to re-play a particular chapter it can be opened through the contents menu.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to take note of the following:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. In case your display aspect ratio is anything other than 16:9, the game may not show up on your screen properly. In order to fix this, you should disable a full-screen mode and enter a windowed mode (Alt+Enter), align the window to the borders of the image (it's easier to do so when you're in the menu) and return to the full-screen mode. (These settings may reset after closing the game, or they may not. I'm not sure about the kind of logic these things follow).\r\n</p>\n<p>2. Please do not close the game during animations, otherwise it can start from the wrong moment next time you open it.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. There isn't a volume setting in the game itself, so make sure to set it from your computer settings before launching the game. The novel turned out to be pretty loud, since the sound was being set on 16% volume. This is the volume I suggest you use.\r\n</p>\n<p>4. The game may bug which causes the sound to be extremely quiet, or disappear entirely. I don't know why it is happening, and neither can I fix it, but the bug can be fixed by reloading the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7ff4f835080de961d5b3568c3f36a5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewis Knight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
