It's just a crappy 3D game <em>\u00e0 l\u00e1</em> <strong>\"Flappy Bird\"\u00a0</strong>with a <em>first-person </em> point-of-view. Try to jump through the holes and get the highscore. Use the<em> <strong>W</strong></em> and<em><strong> D</strong></em> keys to waggle through the air, left and right. The walls in front will kill you and the others will bounce and probably kill you... I <strong>tried</strong> to make it super hard, but playable.</p><p>Sound effects obtained from <em>https://www.zapsplat.com</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed23cd8c033e6b1baa8d5469034d8828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jalmeida1994"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
