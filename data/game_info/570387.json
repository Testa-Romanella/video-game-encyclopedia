Submission to the Minimalist Game Jam #1.</p>\r\nMulti and Minimalistic\r\n<p>The multiple\u00a0states in the game are represented as sun(happy), raindrop(sad) and fire(angry). These are also 3 common states of human mind/emotion. Finding balance between collecting and expressing them is key. There is no background music, only a couple of short sfx for minimalist audio. There are 2 main colors used(black and white) and a 3rd color, which depends on the player's state.</p>\r\nOther Info\r\n<p><strong>The game is probably buggy and laggy so I'm sorry in advance. The Windows ver. is probably less laggy.</strong>\u00a0In the game, there is only a menu, a tutorial and a boss fight. To fight the boss, follow the instructions in the tutorial. Reaching 100% more or 0% less will break the bottle, the keeper of emotions(states).</p>\n<p>As of now, the game is more of a prototype of an idea I was inspired by, but it could definitely be something worth expanding on the future. What do you think?</p>\n<p>Comment any bugs you have encountered, suggestions, questions, etc.</p>\n<p>@amamakeart - Art glas - Code, Sfx\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bfxr2, Audacity, Unity, Krita - softwares used</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3b81375b91fe244afbc25e48d7b407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["glas"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
