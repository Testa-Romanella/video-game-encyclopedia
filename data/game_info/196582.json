As soon as you \r\nstart building, the water starts flowing. The tiles you can build are \r\ndisplayed in the right (blue on will be placed next). Placing each tile \r\ncosts 'money'. Replacing a tile costs extra money. Each filled pipe \r\nsegments yields money and score. Filling a crossroad both directions \r\ngives bonus score. The game ends if the water cannot flow any further \r\n(i.e. to a wrong tile or to an empty tile).</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Enter - place tile</p>\n<p>The game is turn-based. But every move of the cursor also counts as a turn.<br/></p>\n<p>Source: https://github.com/eugeneloza/...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40426fc29684667e3234855eaa7fd8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["decoherence"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
