You can only lose if the asteroids break the gun. There are statistics of asteroids skipped up (as well as other parameters), those who wish can determine the desired level of difficulty for themselves (it can be difficult not to miss a single asteroid). Attention! At low brightness, the pause button is invisible, it is located under the gun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T15:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a578273416d21f290aa40b86c066fcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Denotatum"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
