In the game, the purpose of the player is looking for keys to open the secret final door. The puzzles of the game need the player to collect the key for each corresponding door and open new sections for collecting new keys and to open new doors. The final secret gate will be unlocked when the player collected all the keys and safely back to the safe zone. Player has limited energy to freeze monsters in the maze. When the player used up the energy, the monster will unfreeze and chase the player. Don't try to get into the red zone in front of the monsters. Unless you want to have a try.\r\n</p>How to Play<p>\r\nMove the player with WASD keys or arrow keys. Mouse controls the player's move direction. Find keys and open doors with the same symbol. Get all keys, open the final Gate!\r\n</p>Follow Me on<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Linkedin</strong></li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3d2587af05f55851c80f84302e3c2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Gordon Lee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
