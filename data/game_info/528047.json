You, as a player, need to make other players fall by shooting furballs, pushing or jumping on top of them. Initially, you have lots of fur to shoot, but then you become lighter as you make fur balls and throw them, meaning that you can jump and move faster but you\u2019re easily pushed.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is fast and dynamic, you need to constantly jump and move to avoid being hit, and pay attention to the position of other players. There are different strategies, each one with pros and cons,\u00a0 will you shoot a lot to become lighter and faster or will you prefer being heavy, slow but resistant?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5c092fe89d7102afa8c18638b0a75f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
