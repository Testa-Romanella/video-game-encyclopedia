This occurred in two blocks on the same day. Things that I didn't include in the three hours were making the itch.io page and fixing some graphical errors caused by exporting to web. This was a very new experience for me as previously the shortest game jam that I've done was over a week. In retrospect it was probably a bad idea to make a game with levels, as there's very little time to come up with good level ideas and explore how the mechanics can interact with each other. However, I still managed to implement all of the mechanics that I wanted to and still create 5 levels.</p>\r\nCode\r\n<p> The code for this game is available at https://github.com/ThatCoolCoder/trijam-190 but be warned that it's not very clean.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/675d10ba2f9819af7bcae10be9dae452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThatCoolCoder"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
