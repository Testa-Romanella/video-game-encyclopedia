You play as a Mitch Metello, a newcomer looking to rise through the company ranks!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is a third-person action adventure game, mixing platforming mechanics with a strong combat system. You have a big moveset at your disposal to crush your opponents with! You can wall-jump, air dash, vertical wall-run and much more! Another mechanic in the game is that your aerial drift dertermines what air-attack you do (back, neutral and forward)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made this in the span of approx. 2 months! Working as a solo-dev, so Im super proud of it!! Also, all feedback is greatly\u00a0appreciated.</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/erikskog_\u00a0- gonna post here more regularly if you want to follow-up the development of the game!</p>\n<p><strong>- HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Jump/Confirm</p>\n<p>Left shift - Dash</p>\n<p>Left click - Attack/Pick up</p>\n\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>Left joystick = Movement</p>\n<p>Right joystick = Camera</p>\n<p>A - Jump/Confirm</p>\n<p>B - Dash</p>\n<p>X - Attack/Pick up</p>\n\r\n\r\nQuick credits!\r\nTextures from textures.com\r\nSFX from freesound.com and zapsplat.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T16:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb3abe679a2c7ca1d50b09688250b18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erik Skog"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
