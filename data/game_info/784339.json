Inspired by the parry mechanic in fighting games as well as Pokemon Stadium's Rock Harden minigame, the simple goal is to use your shield to block projectiles while managing your shield energy. Timing the shield perfectly will give some energy back.</p>\n<p>Developed by:</p>\n<p>Corey Nambu - Programmer and team lead</p>\n<p>Bryan Tsai - Programmer and artist</p>\n<p>Miguel - Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b29d6c84c433e70a1269efe486eaf1eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KoiNip"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
