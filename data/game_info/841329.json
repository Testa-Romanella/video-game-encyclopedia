All you have is a flashlight. Is something following you? You better get out of here before you find out.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT:<br/>This is the first game I have ever made. I just started learning how to make games in Unity and using C# so any feedback and/or suggestions that can help me improve and make better games in the future is much appreciated.<br/><br/>The game is free-to-play and will always be, since it is my first game. However donations are very appreciated!<br/><br/>//PureToxic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T09:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/927/9275453974afdeef2f5c4845fd381e5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PureToxic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
