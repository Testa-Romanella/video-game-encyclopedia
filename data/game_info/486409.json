{"id": 486409, "slug": "lobby", "name": "LOBBY", "name_original": "LOBBY", "description": "<p>Welcome to the sweet world of lobby-ism.</p>\n<p>every day, billions of tax dollars are being passed to business as care packages, especially in times of economic crisis.</p>\n<p>Your job as a lobbyist is to ensure that all that money arrives at your parent company.</p>\n<p>But uh-oh! other lobbyists are also out after that same score. So you must face them publicly and debate them, winning the case on behalf of your corporation.</p>\n<p>(Btw, this is thickly juiced in satire if anyone should be in doubt.)</p><p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p><p>Lobby is a turn based battle royale using manipulation strategies and talking points in place of weapons, spells and minions. It pits eight players against eachother in a debate for glory (empty seats filled by a super basic AI.)</p><p>This game is heavily inspired by games like AutoChess, Underlords and Hearthstone Battlegrounds, plus a throwaway line from an old Extra Credits episode, where they talked about using the mechanics of combat for dialogue/debate.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>Ran out of time, so the game \"works\"\u00a0but is far from what I had planned. Will return and polish it up when I have time, but will keep the jam original for historic reasons.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made by : Nils \"GeckoDev\" Munch<br/></p>\n<p>Motivational manager : Jill \"Kill\" Petersen</p>\n<p>Vector suited gentlemen\u00a0artwork for poster :\u00a0Rudall Cimanggis (Licenced)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d761f9137d60dfd845bafacd7d96ea5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nils Munch"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
