You finally find your prey, a sound asleep kid, probably dreaming about scary clowns, when... you realise that other ghosts like you ended up in the same room as you, and just as hungry as you are.</p>\n<p>It's time to fight for survival (and gluttony)! Only the winner will eat!</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nIn menus\r\n<ul><li>mouse/keyboard: as usual</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIn game\r\n<ul><li>mouse: look around</li><li>mouse left click: shoot</li><li>W/A/S/D: move around</li><li>ESC: toggle pause menu</li><li>TAB (hold): show scoreboard</li></ul>\r\nTechnologies\r\n<p>Dreameaters has been developes using Unity and C#.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Database:\u00a0Database Control (Free)\u00a0by\u00a0Solution Studios</li><li>Bedroom environment:\u00a0Bedroom\u00a0asset by\u00a0Vertex Studio</li><li>Weapon model:\u00a0Sci-Fi Guns\u00a0asset by\u00a0Astronaut</li><li>Ghost character model:\u00a0Level 1 Monster Pack\u00a0asset by\u00a0PI Entertainment Limited</li><li>Gun icon:\u00a064 Flat Game Icons\u00a0asset by\u00a0Office57</li><li>Laser shot sound:\u00a0Laser Wrath 4\u00a0sound effect track by\u00a0marcuslee</li><li>Gun cocking sound:\u00a0Gun cock\u00a0sound effect track by\u00a0pockroozer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e8a02c72b8713b956a00efc7890f612.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oddlord"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
