It probably won't, but better to make sure.</p>\n<p>Anyways, this is my first LD entry, which I submitted for Ludum Dare 32, the one with the Unconventional weapon theme. It's... far from good, but hey, everyone starts somewhere, right?</p>\n<p>You may notice a lack of music... and sound fx... that's because I removed it all, since I thought that all audio had to be made from scratch. I didn't... know if built in audio is okay, but I didn't want to take any chances.</p>\n<p>If you do play this, be sure to equip new weapons when you get them. Forgetting to do so will result in lots and lots of death.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c3c4696f0cdbd5102f2f332b537d205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KingHeron"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
