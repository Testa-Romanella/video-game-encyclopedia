In order to get your human form back, you have to <strong>roll over</strong> their minions, <strong>suck</strong> their blood <strong>in </strong>and <strong>paint </strong>the demonic symbol on the ground with it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Available in both <strong>French</strong> and <strong>English</strong>. This game was created during the <em><strong>ENJAM 2022</strong></em>, a two-days jam organized by ENJMIN\u00a0students. It was originally made for the <strong>PlayDate</strong> but you can find a <strong>PC version</strong> <strong>below</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>THE CONTROLS ON PLAYDATE (HOW TO PLAY ON PC BELOW !)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>move forward/backward\u00a0: <strong>turn the crank</strong></li><li>rotate : \u2192 <em>(right)</em> and \u2190 <em>(left)</em> on the <strong>D-pad</strong></li><li>paint\u00a0: \u2193 <em>(down)</em> on the <strong>D-pad</strong></li><li>skip\u00a0: <strong>hold\u00a0\u24b7</strong></li></ul>\n<p>You are the steamroller on the screen: <strong>yes</strong>, the weird sprite in the center <strong>is </strong>your character! The main character\u00a0has been<strong> cursed by a demon</strong> and is trying to become human again.</p>\n\n<p>But <strong>how to move then</strong>? My directional cross doesn't work. It's normal! You have to use the \"<strong>Crank</strong>\" to move forward and backward!!! Spinning in one direction allows you to go forward and in the other, you go backward.</p>\n\n<p>To turn your steam-werewolf-roller, just press the <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> directional arrows. It's as easy as pie!</p>\n\n<p>To get back to your original looks and stop the curse, you must successfully summon the demon that cursed you. To do this you can kill the demon's cultists <strong>and draw its symbol on the ground with their blood!!!</strong> <em>*Narrator catching his breath*</em></p>\n\n<p>Your goal is to draw correctly and within the time limit <em>the symbol corresponding to the demon you are trying to summon</em>. Be careful though because the crushed cultists do not offer you an unlimited amount of blood, <strong>you have to manage your blood gauge properly!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>ONE HANDED MODE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Activating the one handed mode in the settings let you use the Playdate's gyroscope to move the steamroller forward and backward. The other keys do not change, allowing anyone to play the game with one hand only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CHOOSE YOUR DIFFICULTY</strong></p>\n<p>If you prefer, it is also possible to deactivate the game timer. Then you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your massacre without hurrying. The only way to lose is to consume all your blood supply and have no more cultists on the field.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY ON PC</strong></p>\n<p>Download the \"<strong>pdx</strong>\" file of the game.</p>\n<p>Download the <strong>Playdate SDK</strong> here :\u00a0https://play.date/dev/</p>\n<p>Execute it, it will install the \"<strong>Playdate simulator</strong>\" application on your computer.</p>\n<p>You can launch it by pressing the \"<strong>Windows</strong>\" key and typing \"<strong>Playdate Simulator</strong>\" then Enter.</p>\n<p>Once the simulator is opened, open the \"<strong>File</strong>\" menu at the top, then \"<strong>Open</strong>\", and locate the \"<strong>pdx</strong>\" file of the game you downloaded.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY ON PLAYDATE</strong></p>\n<p>Follow the official guide on the PlayDate website</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>A game created by :</p>\n<p>Sam Chevrin\u00a0(Sound Design, Ergonomy),\u00a0</p>\n<p>Marie Pakula\u00a0(Game Design, Narrative Design),\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jules Poulain\u00a0(Programming, Visual Novel part),\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dorian\u00a0Vabre\u00a0(Programming, Gameplay, Game graphics).</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Lauralie Girard (cover art) &amp; Charles Vincent (in-game character).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T07:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eeea219f8fe73f21deb007eba845b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bigaston", "Leaping", "Railnof", "MarieCajou", "Linfusion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
