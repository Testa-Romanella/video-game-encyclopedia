It was made in 8 months so it may have a few bugs and there are some things that aren't as developed as I would like. Although it is a \"complete experience\" it's meant to act as a kind of 15-minute prologue to a larger game. It's a branching choice-based game where you make dialogue and QT choices to achieve one of four different endings. <br/></p>\n<p>Fancy description below...<br/></p>\n<p>After both her parents were killed, Rae found a way to survive as part of a gang of mercenaries. Now, she\u2019s tasked with retrieving a stolen religious relic. Along with her brother, Lucien, she\u2019s summoned to the mysterious city of Kalrathton. This place was once ruled by a mighty religious order, which has since fallen to ruin. Her task seems simple; track down the relic. However, she\u2019ll quickly learn that nothing here is ever what it seems.\r\n</p>\n<p>When she finds herself guided by a strange and powerful entity, she will have to decide who to trust. The people are shades of grey. No one's strictly good or evil. Every action has consequences and not always the ones you\u2019d expect. What type of person will Rae choose to be? What is she willing to sacrifice for power, for truth or for family? <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, hope you have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Content Warning - Some references to domestic violence</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb1557296ccf6dc6972d21388fcfd6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lanners"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
