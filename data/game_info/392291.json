I would prefer watching a movie instead then playing a story game. <br/>Heroes forces is about grinding levels and Dungeons. Unlocking new Gears, new mechanics, and progressing with low effort.<br/><br/><strong>Why would i play this game?</strong><br/>This game is about relax and play. Thats it you do repeatable content and is rewarded every time.<br/>This game works as a stress reliefer. and not as an \"Adventureee!\"<br/><br/><br/><strong>The price is too high?</strong><br/>Think about it how much would you pay for cinema? for a 2 hours movies?<br/>Wouldnt you also be entertained in a 2 hours game for only $10?<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Dungeons<br/></li><li>Leveling<br/></li><li>Gearing<br/></li><li>Trading<br/></li><li>Class Changes<br/></li><li>Crafting<br/></li><li>Talents</li></ul><br/><strong>Heroes Forces</strong> is an alternative to SuperGrind RPG, as SuperGrind RPG was made for even lazier people! =)<h3>Gatekeeper</h3><br/>Teleports you to the Dungeons.<h3>Death Knight Class</h3><br/>Play as a Death Knight.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T03:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cdb64e8d9a0fc81adb49198df460239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alessandra Mercante"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Alessandra Mercante"], "esrb_rating": null}
