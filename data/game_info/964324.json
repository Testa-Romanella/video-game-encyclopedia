The longer you stay, the deeper you sink.<br/>\r\nExplore the asylum of sadness, where time stops, unless you progress by taking the calendar pages into your room down in the basement of the asylum. The longer you stay in this place, the more horrors will try and stop you, fix you, change you, the more the whole place gets affected by your presence.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou'll meet the creatures of such a place: Lara and Plague Doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLara seems like just another patient, who's room is right next to yours, but it is not always clear whether she's helping or going against you.<br/>\r\nThe Plague Doctor may try to treat you, but he also does it painfully or simply stopping you from making the time move and damaging you in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has 15 day cycles to offer, where the asylum gets progressively more and more sinister and dangerous. The player has the options to run and hide, but often needs to simply confront the unknown and keep learning the story of this place and its citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe evil can be locked up.<br/>\r\nPrison. Grotto. Asylum.<br/>\r\nThese unsafe places will manifest through you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T03:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a534221399a9f10391f218a8173a5f4.jpg", "website": "https://www.vidasgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vidas Salavejus"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Vidas Salavejus"], "esrb_rating": null}
