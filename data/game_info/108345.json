Not having decent internet access until I was a teen sent me down a path of learning to make my own fun, and through doing that stumbled around and made a few hundred mistakes along the way.</em></p><p><em>I became interested in game development in a time when independent game development seemed like an impossible proposition- people released games for free, or asked very small amounts of money for what usually amounted to years of 'hobby' development in their spare time. Nowadays we've seen indie development become more aesthetic and business-focused, something I've had trouble understanding and adapting to. With that in mind, I set out to make a game that I felt represented those freeware and shareware games I grew up with.</em></p><p><em>Now I'm here, deep into C programming with some discontent with modern games and their designs; <strong>RoboCorps is like nothing else because I created the game I wanted to play</strong>.</em></p><p><em>RoboCorps is rough around the edges and sometimes trips over itself, but my drive to keep perfecting it knows no bounds; your monetary support goes directly towards making my vision of it just a bit clearer, and for that I am immensely grateful.\"</em></p>\r\n\tTrailer\r\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b75af6fb24ec801bee0fd56b5f0f714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CodeEntropy"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
