It Has Been Off And On Development For Months Now And I No Longer Have The Motivation To Add More Features Or Levels To It. So I'm Finishing It up And Releasing It To The Public. I Know That Not A Lot of People Will Play This Game, If Any. But It Feels Good To Have Another Completed Game Under My Belt. (This Game Was Made With The Help of Shaun Spalding's Complete Platformer Series!) If Anyone Does Play This Game, Thank you!
