As you defeat monsters you will learn a few new actions, and each turn you will slowly recover the mana you need to perform some of these actions. Some creatures may become cursed with alliteration, preventing them from attacking, which will let you easily recover mana.<br/></p>\r\nWhat this game is all about\r\n<p>Battle Test version 1.08 was finished on the 3rd of February, 2015. Being a result of my high school software development course, it serves as practice for my eventual major project [h3h3 game]. Battle Test was developed using Visual Basic with a linear code structure, hence why the game must close every time it is finished.
