Players start either healthy or infected and don\u2019t know other players\u2019 roles. Healthy players must communicate to determine who is infected and kill them. Infected players must discreetly infect everyone.</p>\n<p>Players can load up the game and host or join a private direct connect match over IP\u00a0and port 7777 or\u00a0a public match over matchmaking (this nearly doesn't work, though, so avoid it if possible).</p>\n<p>Made in Unity for ARS 420:\u00a0Team Game Design.
