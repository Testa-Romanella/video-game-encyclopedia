{"id": 325903, "slug": "void-alpha-prototype-build", "name": "Void (Alpha Prototype Build)", "name_original": "Void (Alpha Prototype Build)", "description": "<p><em>Void </em>is an in-progress 3D Unity game featuring action adventure gameplay and a visual novel inspired dialogue system. As the Void Walker, you awaken in a strange, dangerous,  and unfamiliar world. Talk to the citizens in the town, fight against the horrors of the Void, and investigate the mysteries surrounding you as you discover your place in things. Controller and mouse + keyboard are supported.<br/><br/>Currently, there's 20-30+ minutes of gameplay and unique content to explore around in. As it is, this is intended to be closer to a lengthy demo rather than a full finished game. Some assets are still placeholder and it's my intention to gradually replace them, for now the game is in a fairly stable state with an ending that leaves it open for further content. Please enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f58d8660fb4056fa988058f822e0ec44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sharev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
