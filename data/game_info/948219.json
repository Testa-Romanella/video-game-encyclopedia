The main theme was <em>Lost World</em>\u00a0and the additional requirement was <em>environmental storytelling</em>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Play as a cat and explore (and escape from) an abandoned ancient temple while navigating through numerous entries left from Liquid Spark researchers. The flow of the game is guided by pressure plates that may open or reset doors. Furthermore, animation, assets and scene composition are used to guide the eye of the player (or at least we tried to use them this way).</p>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>\n<p>cat.astro,\u00a0thoozee\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Softwares</strong></p>\n<p><em>Godot</em>\u00a04.0.1,\u00a0<em>Blender</em>\u00a03.3.4,\u00a0<em>GIMP</em>\u00a02.10.\r\n</p>\n<p>How to play<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>for movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> for picking objects in the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> for jump-but it's only an animation that won't do much more.

You play a a cat that must explore (and escape the temple). Since this is a 3D game and uses a lot of heavy stuff (shaders and rigged cat to name a few), and since it is not as optimized as we would have liked, we will release only the windows build.\r\n</p>\n<p>The project was far larger than we thought so we had to reduce it somehow.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1aeed2c00326b091229334f81d1caae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thoozee", "cat.astro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
