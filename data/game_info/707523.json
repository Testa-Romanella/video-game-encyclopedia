Currently, it simulates an Underwater Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) in two environments--a swimming pool and open water. In the full game, players will be able to build their own ROVs, try them out in the pool, and then take them on missions.</p>\n<p>The ROV being simulated is more complex than a student ROV would normally be, to\u00a0\u00a0make sure it all works. Controls are mapped similar to how a student ROV would be.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Forward/back and y-rotation (yaw): </strong>WASD or gamepad left stick</li>\n<ul><li><strong>Alternately, you can use triggers (forward on each side) and shoulders (reverse on each side) to do tank-tread style driving</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Up/down and x-rotation (pitch): </strong>Arrow keys or gamepad right stick</li><li><strong>Side/side (strafe) and z-rotation (roll): </strong>IJKL or D-pad (left and right strafe, up and down roll)</li><li><strong>1st person/3rd person view:</strong> 1 for first person, 2 for third person, or X (Playstation controller)/gamepad south to toggle</li><li><strong>Reset rotation: </strong>Space bar or triangle\u00a0(Playstation)/gamepad north</li><li><strong>Switch scenes: </strong>0 (zero) or square (Playstation)/gamepad west<ul><li>There are two scenes: A swimming pool to get your bearings and then a larger outdoor area to explore.\u00a0 There's not a lot of wildlife there, but there are an octopus, a barracuda, a great white shark, and a clownfish to find near your starting point.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2aa/2aa867a461c4782fa36b195ecc09a9bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["PeterGuenther"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
