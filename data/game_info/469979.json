The story is told abstractly, and will be further expanded upon in the full release. I'd like to hear what you believe the story is about. The game is inspired by Twin Peaks, Silent Hill 2, and the early Resident Evil games.</p>\n<p> You are in an ancient forest, where monsters and the likes of you have come for thousands of years to end their lives appropriately. But there is an unexpected host with mysterious intentions.\u00a0</p>\n<p> This is the demo of a game that I want to finish in the near future. It was developed in its entirety in about 1 month. I want to add more puzzles, delve deeper into the story and create a 1 or 2 hour experience for people that might like it. The demo is basically here to set the tone for the rest of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d21f68ffe4ff2fb04fffa8840aa84e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Placebo Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
