It was made with a minimalistic art style and hopefully smoothing music, in the hope of being a relaxing experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls are simple: click on a shape to start a line, click again to stop tracing it, and click on the line to delete it. The level is completed when all dots are connected.</p>\n<p>I would recommend playing in fullscreen mode.\u00a0There are 16 levels\u00a0and about 10 min of soundtrack, so if you finish before the end, sit back relax and take a moment to breath :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85ae6a63845d483b395a6cfbb4dc5e61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Frettini"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
