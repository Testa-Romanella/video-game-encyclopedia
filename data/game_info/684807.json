Outside of the ship you have limited TIME on your battery power. Watch out for pickups to refill your power source, but being almost out of TIME isn't necessarily a bad thing ... you get a double damage boost when you're overclocked, and when you're really close to the end of your power, TIME seems to slow down around you as your hyper processor kicks in.</p>\n<p>Patrol your platforms. Hover, shoot, hover some more and buy new upgrades to make survive the next round.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong><br/><strong>A</strong> - Left<br/><strong>D</strong> - Right<br/><strong>W</strong> - Jump, hold to hover</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys or\u00a0JIL</strong><br/><strong>&lt; Arrow or\u00a0J</strong> - Fire left<br/><strong>&gt; Arrow or\u00a0L</strong> - Fire right<br/><strong>^ Arrow or\u00a0I</strong> - Fire up if you've got Top Gun<br/><br/><strong>R</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Restart the game if you encounter a bug<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad Controls</strong><br/>I know at least an Xbox controller works, sorry I couldn't test more, and the controller won't work in the shop, so you'll have to bounce back and forth between rounds, but I still highly recommend a controller.</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong>-Pad or Left Joystick to move left and right.
