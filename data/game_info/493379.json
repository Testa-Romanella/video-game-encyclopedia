First you only have yourself, but later your party will grow. Place characters to your advantage given the level you face.</p>\n<p>Each character has a certain amount of movement points which can be split into multiple actions. An action for a character consists of either attacking an enemy, walking or guarding. A character cannot both attack and guard during the same turn.</p>\n<p>There are three types of units in Pocket Tactics and each one has an advantage over the other:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Sword\u00a0 beats the Bow </p>\n<p>The Bow\u00a0\u00a0beats the Wand\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Wand\u00a0\u00a0beats the Sword\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Recruitment is necessary in order to get a team full of diverse units. Start by whittling an opponent down to a low enough health. There will be an icon\u00a0 to indicate they want to talk. Walk up to them and select \u201cSpeak\u00a0 \u201d. You will need to persuade them. Each enemy is different, so choose your answers wisely!</p>\n<p>During your turn, you can press\u00a0\u00a0[Z on keyboard] and change which character to control by pressing the\u00a0 directions. When a character has finished their moves for that turn, they will not be available.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:23:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df0dfbe3e3c1bb1db0d9f3dea09af298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["moawling", "Froggy_Chair", "Armen138", "Ondjon", "Team Potato", "CamiDee57", "kssio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
