This is the first game I've made\u00a0 and it would be really great to hear your feedback on it so I can improve it. The game is a speedrunning game where you have to destroy tower blocks\u00a0 to get your hexagon to the bottom as quickly as you can. There is a highscores page where you can see your fastest times on each of the 18 levels.\u00a0 I hope to get this game out onto mobile devices soon so look out for it when it does!</p><p>Instagram:\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.instagram.com/joshstigzelius</p><p>Twitter:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://twitter.com/joshstigzelius</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15de23dfe2e21d6d2cdf66b9a2397ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Josh Stigzelius"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
