An empire made up of multiple species from various social classes. Your task is defending the capital planet from the invaders, which have been causing the empire trouble in many other planets for a period of time now, ranging from acts of terrorism to destroying entire cities. Intel suggests that they are unleashing the majority of their forces on the capital. So defeating them here would most likely quench their attacks for good.</p>\n<p>Note: the game in it's current state is very unfinished and isn't worth playing rn I finish it this week.<br/></p><p>Controls:<br/>WASD or Arrow keys: Movement<br/>Space or Left mouse Button: Shoot<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game was made in Godot engine.<br/>Sprites made by Free and Premium Game Assets (GUI, Sprite, Tilesets)<br/>https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-enemy-spaceship-2d-sprites-pixel-art</p>\n<p>Music used: Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns: Danse Macabre by Kevin MacLeodhttps://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kevin_MacLeod/Classical_Sampler/Danse_Macabre<br/></p>\n<p>This is a late submission for the YUdum #2 game jam. Admittedly doing this while I have a lot of things to take care of irl is not a wise choice but I still wanted to do it. This is the third game I ever made. And while progress has been slow there is progress in my skill. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a4b56ea2770f461aa358875c83adb52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hikinginthedark"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
