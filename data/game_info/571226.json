It's a race against time to catch as many violators of the rules as they can to earn points and achieve all 3 stars for each level! Every few levels, a\u00a0new rule is introduced and a new violation made ticket-able so that players can learn more and catch more to meet the challenge of increasing level requirements.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Urbana\u00a0</em>was a CAPSTN1 entry (1st term, SY 2019-2020) designed with the goal of educating players on basic traffic rules in the Philippines. As the solo developer, I am proud and happy to share this prototype!\u00a0I do hope to work on it further in the future so if you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know. Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185b894373cc4d3a4efd5bed3494c718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benilde GameDev", "Kabibi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
