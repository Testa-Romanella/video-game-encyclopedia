It's more of a tech demo to demonstrate that I am a capable Unity Developer programmer and that I can create a finished-looking game, for different platforms,\u00a0 within a timeframe.</p>\n<p>I went through the course material and expanded on it.<br/></p>\n<p>- Added more platforms that can only be reached by obtaining a special ability to double jump.</p>\n<p>- Added more areas to the given map layout they provided. More areas to explore.</p>\n<p>- Added Health Potion to the smuggler shop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Added sounds to the game. The course did not go through the sound process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Skeletons revive within a random time frame (30-120 seconds).</p>\n<p>- Added a basic intro to introduce the player to the objective.</p>\n<p>- Added some other tweaks that enhance the player experience.</p>\n\n<p>The objective is to obtain the key and escape to the castle.</p>\n<p>Abilities: Flamesword (damage from 2 to 3) and\u00a0 Flight of Boots (Enables Double Jump).</p>\n<p>Controls: A and D keys to move left/right.
