Of course, harvesting Pamogo mushrooms is strictly prohibited as the forest is a nature reserve, but we've assembled this book merely as a guide for the curious. It should in no way be construed as an endorsement of illegal mushroom harvesting. On the following pages, you'll find a wealth of information about some of the species of mushroom that you might encounter in the Pamogo Woods.
