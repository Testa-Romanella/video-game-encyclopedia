But she doesn't have any friends to come and cheer her on... All of her peers laugh at her, only having her parents show up every year, so this year she has decided to make some friends to bring with her. Only problem is - no-one from her species wants to be her friend, so she will need to make some human friends... But how will they react to her? Will they fear her? Or perhaps worship her? This only makes her anxiety worse, until she remembers the comic book store not too far from the tournament - perhaps those humans will be more receptive to her. Better safe then sorry though, so she has decided to win them over with gifts, and to stay hidden.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you help Julia with her attempt to make friends? Or will you scare them all off and cause Julia to be laughed at again?</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys to move, left-shift to turn into a crab for 3 seconds</p>\n<p>Esc to exit the game</p>\n<p>Collect the gifts around the map, avoid being seen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Josh Kitchen (Programming)\u00a0https://twitter.com/josh_kit_games\u00a0https://josh-k.itch.io/</p>\n<p>JasJanken (Art, Manager and VO-Enby)\u00a0https://twitter.com/jasjanken\u00a0https://jasjanken.carrd.co/#</p>\n<p>Simon Yver (VO-Monster and Sadd)<br/></p>\n<p>Isaac Mendel (VO-Pacca)</p>\n<p>Sam Dodd (VO-Kenny)</p>\n<p>Charlie Farren (VO-Cutscenes and Lye)</p>\n<p>Jack Shore (Music,Sounds and Cutscenes)</p>\n<p>Ethan Robinson (Writer and Producer)</p>\n<p>Elaine (Writer)</p>\n<p>Micheal Lovell (Sound editor)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/64506a8119882272bd3ae156d75bee74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7F"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
