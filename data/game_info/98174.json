It's a drag and drop game about running a monster nursery. You need to nurse your eggs until they hatch, and then feed the baby monsters until they're big enough to leave the nest.</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 33, and the theme was You are the Monster. We wanted to do something a little bit less traditional, and we're happy that we ended up a game that fitted the theme really well. The idea was to make picking things up and flinging them around a fun interaction, but that didn't quite work because the pace of the game meant you don't have much time to mess about. If you get chance you should try throwing your monsters wildly into the air for no reason, maybe it will be fun? </p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Mouse to move the cursor, hold left button to pick things up and release left button to thrown or drop things\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt's quite hard to explain, but the basic idea is catch eggs and drop them gently on the floor when they are ready to hatch, and then to feed humans to the little monsters to make them grown. When they are fully grown then fling them out of the nest.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t The mother monster will catch new humans every minute or so, you need to grab them and drop them onto the baby monster that most needs food. Hungry monsters will show a little sad face, really hungry monsters will show a red cross, and fully grown monsters will show an arrow pointing to the way out.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t There are 3 types of monsters, and when they get bigger they will eat the smaller monsters of a different type to them. You need to pick them up and throw them out of the way of each other. When a monster is fully grown then throw it out of the nest quickly so it doesn't start eating the little ones\r\n</p>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t&amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756795929cbb5857be565b8d1f6219e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
