Though it is like two minutes long, it's kind of funny so pay a look at it at least. What else do you want it was made in about 2 hours.</p>\n<p>THIS IS NOT A DEMO OR IS EVEN RELATED TO THE ACTUAL GAME.</p>\n<p>The actual game should be finished in about one week or two, then I will update the game and you will get the real game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:49:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/27840c4e123fbb9b8da93272ecea45be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["cocotongo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
