The theme was <strong>Could you pass me the salt, please?</strong></p>\n<p>So, I've come with the idea of throw some salt crystals through a river to hit a picnic blanket. And if you missed, you turned into a Attila guy because the salt tends to sterilize the ground.</p>\n<p>I can't make more for the moment. The only things done are : <br/>- the plot : ground, river (with animation), blanket (randomly spawn)<br/>- put a crystal on the ground make the grass disappear and the salt too<br/></p>\n<p>But there is no throwing control or check for a victory.</p>\n<p>To put a salt crystal, simply left click on the area you want.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d0/2d0a60fac9e8e18591ba916bc4650168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kthulhu1947"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
