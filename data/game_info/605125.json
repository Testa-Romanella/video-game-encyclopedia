Great for bringing down the boss enemies.</p>\r\nCannon\r\n\n<p>The\u00a0<em>Cannon\u00a0</em>specializes in dealing with large groups of regular enemies, but deals less damage to each unit\u00a0than the\u00a0<em>Ballista.</em>\u00a0</p>\r\nWall\r\n\n<p>The\u00a0<em>Wall\u00a0</em>will stop enemies in their track, hurting them with thorns in it's blue and pink versions. However, enemies push back and will eventually break each wall for the rest of that round. Works great when combined with other damage dealing towers that can rain fire on stationary enemies.</p>\r\nThe Shop\r\n<p>Inspired by auto-battlers, the shop must be leveled up to increase the odds of finding the rarer (and better) units. You can also pay less than leveling up to gamble with your current odds and try to find better units you may need for the challenge ahead.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>This game was made by Corben Gilbert and Gabe St. Onge over the course of 3 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:41:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1bbfce4af23cb99c03866a509134921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Corben Gilbert", "Gabe St. Onge"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
