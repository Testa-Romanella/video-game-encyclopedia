The burning days passed by - the freezing nights too. And yet, we were still there. Nothing could have overcome our determination. It guided our steps. The atrocities of the new wars, all these repeated invasions have brought up in us old visceral forces that we should never have known. And despite all that, there was nothing we could do to prevent it ... this genocide ... The whole earth is nothing more than a vast ruin, a shadow of a civilization that it has housed ... at the mercy of a planet that owes it everything.<br/>We didn't know it yet, but my companions and I weren't alone. We thought we were the last bastion of invisible resistance. In reality, we were the very first link.<br/>Billions of billions of kilometers away; allies, friends ... whole armies were preparing. A science from another time came to us and we were not only going to change the course of our destiny, but also that of all of humanity. All... of... Humanity. But that we didn't know yet.\"  - Rover Hamilton, October 2417", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T02:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a23ff815f48a81c769fe6bbc78bf012d.jpg", "website": "https://www.echo-of-ayllu.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 387, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gaiac Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Gaiac Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
