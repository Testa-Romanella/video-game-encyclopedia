The door locks behind you so you can only go forward. Eventually, you would fight a boss in the Intensive Care Unit, and when defeated, the power room is unlocked and the power to the hospital can be turned back on.</p>\n<p>It obviously didn't\u00a0get that far, but it's as much as I could accomplish in just three days.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0\u00a0WASD / Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Throw Scalpel:\u00a0Left Click</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T14:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bc662c61be7b4d55e523f8c6fb4a1f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Rilo007"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
