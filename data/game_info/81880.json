We wanted one awesome app you could buy once and wouldn't have to continue paying for. However, we may be changing to a subscription model since we do a lot of work to update the database with all the new cards, tokens, and promos. But get it now and we'll grandfather you in!  Besides, we think this app is worth way more, and is a much better value than a holiday gift box or a single tournament entry!<br/><br/>Obviously we could use some help some marketing the app.  If you\u2019re good at graphic design and you\u2019d like to help us market, we\u2019ll give you a free promo code for the app!  Send some sample work and ideas to pr@kudit.com for details.<br/><br/>We have lots of awesome features planned to come as well!
