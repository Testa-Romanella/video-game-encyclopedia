(\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5, Misut\u0101 Du) is an arcade game created by Universal in 1982. Similar in some ways to Namco's popular Dig Dug title, Mr. Do! was also popular and saw release on a variety of home video game consoles and systems. It is the first game in the Mr. Do series, and was released both as a standalone game and as a conversion kit (released by Taito Corp.) for existing arcade cabinets. It was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit, and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States. It was remade in Japan as Neo Mr. Do! (\u30cd\u30aa\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5, Neo Misut\u0101 Du). It was also a popular choice on the 1983 video arcade-based game show Starcade.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/613e9e31c18f53a871d305befcda4151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy", "Atari 2600", "SNES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Universal Entertainment", "Universal"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SNK", "Namco", "Ocean Software", "Imagineer", "Taito", "Datasoft", "Tomy", "Coleco"], "esrb_rating": null}
