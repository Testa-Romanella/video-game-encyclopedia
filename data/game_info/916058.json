You are tasked with rescuing the terrified survivors. Use you helicopter to locate the remaining civilians. Get them to safety but avoid the Military tanks, choppers and soldiers who are hell-bent on regaining control of the city at any cost.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><strong>W.A.S.D.(Move)<br/>P.L.(Up/Down)<br/>SHIFT(Turbo)<br/>SPACE(Shoot)</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made with the free version of Coppercube (no coding used). Based on a 3D scan from sketchfab. It's not finished yet, but you can have a bit of fun by searching the city for the 11 survivors and shooting down the enemy soldiers, helicopters, tanks and the Battleship.<br/><br/> <strong>Features:</strong><br/> HUD with stats (Lives/Health/Ammo/Survivors/Enemies/etc.).<br/>3D scanned city (manually cleaned using polygon editor).<br/> Ship, tank, soldier and coptes Ai will aim at the player.<br/> Rescue 11 civilians (fiendishly hidden around the map).<br/> Helicopter will recoil whenever it bumps into buildings.<br/> Homing-missile system attached to the ship.<br/> Missile will destruct on contact with city or player.<br/> Return to the helipad to power-up health and ammo.<br/> Random shoot timings with 3D sound effects.<br/> Rendered 2D sprite animations.<br/> Target indicator for active enemies.<br/> Remake of Portal's (GLaDOS) voice, for all system-events.<br/> Animated building-collapse (not implemented yet).<br/><strong>As usual, I also uploaded the ccb file in case it's useful to anyone else.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>*Note: I'm aware that there are still some stray geometry polygons and holes - sometimes the helicopter gets stuck or flies through the map. I'm fixing it.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T13:31:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/993899bf666bf752de904b958e4fa23e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VP"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
