Wish I had tested the web build sooner, but its still playable.</p>\r\nThe Game's Story\r\n<p>You are just hanging out making some Jack-o-lanterns for Halloween. Make as many as you can in under a minute. I had plans for a scoring system, but it didn't get implemented as I was fighting trying to get the mesh re-topology to work right. As such at this point it is just a chill sim with no scoring system</p>\r\nControl and Instruction Guide\r\n<p>WASD - moves camera</p>\n<p>scroll wheel - zoom camera\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left click and hold\u00a0to start cutting pumpkin. Cut will only activate after you release\u00a0</p>\r\nThoughts on the Game\r\n<p>I am aware that this is a very simple game, however I wanted to challenge myself with doing some low level graphics manipulation by dynamically modifying\u00a0meshes from user input and then gamifing it. I think I got a bit over my head because I ended up reading 8 different research papers to help come up with the methods I used for working on the mesh. Sadly I was not able to resolve all of the edge cases in the time game jam time frame and as a result the cutting methods are unreliable, but I made decent progress and kinda have a gameplan for finishing it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Originally I wanted to have a scoring system where the game would provide requested faces to cut out of the pumpkin and then measure how accurate the user was in matching the face, however since I spent most of my time working on getting the cutting algorithms to work I never got to implement that feature. As a result I had to pivot last minute and just make it work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game jam I also had switched to using the Godot 4 beta out of curiosity. It was interesting to contrast it to Godot 3 and see what features they had changed. This did blindside me a bit as I was relearning a lot of features and ran into a whole new batch of issues with exporting to web. Additionally while Godot 4 may have more features at this point in time it isn't documented as well and the current Godot 3 documentation might just not work for some of the changed features.\u00a0It may have been a bit premature to try using it for a Game Jam, then again this is only my second project with Godot as a whole. Regardless\u00a0I learned a lot and am excited for the future of Godot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first music composition as well. Its a bit rough, but I feel it does a good job of giving the game some spooky vibes. Already gotten a lot of feedback of where I\u00a0can improve in this space.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also didn't realize how much fun I would have modelling props for the game. I felt like the game was kinda empty with just the pumpkin so I spent some time to add some extra environmental pieces and I think it came out really well</p>\n<p>Overall I feel very happy with this project. Despite not getting it to the point I wanted to I had a lot of fun creating it, and playing it. I am frustrated that I wasn't able to finish the mesh manipulation, but I did\u00a0learn a lot and am pumped up for my next game! Thank you again for looking at my project. I greatly appreciate any feedback!\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T09:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c6f94f18efd99f1f7166ba3daa6dc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cranberry Ninja"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
