Although, Scott used this game as a troll game for Five Nights at Freddy's 3.</p><p>I have used the same music from that troll game but mixed it with the original There Is No Pause Button game.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are only 20 levels and the original game has 30 levels, which is why I said it's an *ALMOST* remake of the original!</p><p>Bare in mind, the points system doesn't change depending on how well you do. The points system is just there because the original had the points system. The reason why I remade this game is because I wanted to see if I could and I did, so now you guys can just have fun with the game and not worry about the points system because that's not the priority of the game.</p><p>This version of the game, however, is slightly different. If you dare try this one out? This one doesn't have the points system, but it has something..... else....</p><p>*Link not available yet*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:58:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b892f93f68d5badf2079fa3e6ed0a3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voltz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
