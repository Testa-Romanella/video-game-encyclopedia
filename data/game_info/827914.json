It only has one level because the other doesn't appear correctly... yeah I will probably update it, even if it was supposed to be not great, I do want to improve it at least a bit. but for real it isn't a great game at least at the moment so if you want that, please look somewhere else<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/213ecdd574c5c8ef33406cb9c550e73e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gabethesecond"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
