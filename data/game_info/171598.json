It draws inspiration from games like Flappy Bird and Jetpack Joyride. You play as a ball of slime with the ability to bounce on surfaces. As the game progresses it will speed up and you will lose your ability to bounce. Collect barrels of slime and avoid bio-hazard barrels to stay bouncy. When you lose your bounciness you will start to fall apart and drip. When dripping you won't be able to bounce on surfaces and will Splat! instead. See how far you can get!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f79b9626e43734bc3444791e2e4c6a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["20kgRhesusGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
