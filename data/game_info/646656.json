He managed to change a setting in the main computer and activated the self defense mode of the military skybase. As a result all robots stopped doing their work and activated their weapon systems. Agent Unknown, a robot soldier from another skybase,\u00a0\u00a0has to go in and fix the mess caused by the hacker.
