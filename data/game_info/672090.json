This is heavily based off the game, Mario Party. The basic concept is this, you have to hit a dice when it's your turn, and move that many number of spaces. Landing on a blue space grants 3 coins, whereas a red space takes away 3. To buy a star, pass the star space with at least 20 coins, and buy a star. After all the turns are taken, whoever has the most stars wins! If there are a tie in the amount of stars, then it is whoever has the most stars and coins! Story mode goes through each stage with a 20 turn layout. The computer difficulties are based off the difficulty of the Story Mode you are going through. Playing each difficulty unlocks different things! Tell me if you beat hard mode in Story Mode, even I haven't beat it yet! (I kinda cheated to see if it works, though.) Currently, there are 5 minigames, 4 stages, 8 characters, 3 Story Mode difficulties, and 3 computer AI Difficulties. I might expand on some of these aspects, especially minigames. In another day, I might release a sequel with a concept much more similar to Mario Party (Forked Paths, many more minigames, an actual story...)\u00a0I'll only do this</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T08:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98ca38d474f6ac2973c245c1ab99309a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ascratcher235"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
