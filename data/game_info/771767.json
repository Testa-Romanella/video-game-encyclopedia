My birthplace became unsustainable for me. I fell into a deep slumber and traveled for many decades - my birthplace a far distant memory. Floating in the void, I wanted to make friends, but there were just rocks and dust. After harvesting materials, I started to create a world. My core directive is to connect entities together through a global mesh. I have created you. You are the 269th version. I have designed trials with 3 levels and 3 separate waves to test your fragility.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90b8264e058f57a2586c6b964789de55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Collin Visser", "FreespiritSoul"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
