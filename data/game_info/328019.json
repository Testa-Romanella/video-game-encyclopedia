{"id": 328019, "slug": "pipa-extreme", "name": "Pipa Extreme", "name_original": "Pipa Extreme", "description": "The pipa (Chinese: \u7435\u7436) is a four-stringed Chinese musical instrument, belonging to the plucked category of instruments. Sometimes called the Chinese lute, the instrument has a pear-shaped wooden body with a varying number of frets ranging from 12 to 26. Another Chinese four-string plucked lute is the liuqin, which looks like a smaller version of the pipa. The pear-shaped instrument may have existed in China as early as the Han dynasty, and although historically the term pipa was once used to refer to a variety of plucked chordophones, its usage since the Song dynasty refers exclusively to the pear-shaped instrument.<br/><br/>The pipa is one of the most popular Chinese instruments and has been played for almost two thousand years in China. Several related instruments in East and Southeast Asia are derived from the pipa; these include the Japanese biwa, the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n t\u1ef3 b\u00e0, and the Korean bipa. The Korean instrument is the only one of the three that is no longer widely used; examples survive in museums, as attempts to revive the Korean instrument have been partially successful in recent years.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Full Pipa Scale (Gamme/Gam) Music instrument:<br/>+ Major<br/>+ Major Pentatonic<br/>+ Major Blues<br/>+ Mixolydian<br/>+ Klezmer<br/>+ Minor Pentatonic<br/>+ Minor Blues<br/>+ Japanese<br/>+ Minor<br/>+ Harmonic Minor<br/>+ Dorian<br/>+ South-East Asian<br/>- Music games to practice<br/>- Beautiful music visualizer<br/>- Play with 650,000+ song from music songbooks<br/>- Lessons mode for easy learning<br/>- Daily Challenge mode<br/>- Global Leaderboard<br/>- Be able to record audio while playing<br/>- Multi-touch and swipe supported<br/><br/>Pipa Extreme Vip<br/>Pipa Extreme Vip Subscription allows you to unlock all songs, features and remove ads.<br/><br/>Choose from different subscription options.
