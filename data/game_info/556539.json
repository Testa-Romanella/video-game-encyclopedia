Blazkowicz, the Allies&#39; most valuable agent. In the midst of the German Blitzkrieg, the Spear that pierced the side of Christ is taken from Versailles by the Nazis and secured in the impregnable Castle Wolfenstein. According to legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe.<br />\nYour mission is to infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces.<br />\nSpear of Destiny\u00a0is a prequel to\u00a0Wolfenstein 3-D. It is a first-person shooter that uses the same engine and has the same gameplay, however the game is not divided into 6 separate episodes - all the levels are one long episode.<br />\nThe enemies and weapons are pretty much the same as in\u00a0Wolfenstein 3-D. Only new additions include: new bosses, a new type of enemy, and a new pickup (a large box of ammo).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T12:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/208758e4e7fd88c6212898e62b3b2bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 11, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["id Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["FormGen", "Psygnosis"], "esrb_rating": null}
