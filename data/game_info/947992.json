I plan to update this game as I grow and learn new skills throughout the years. I plan to jam as much content as possible into this and make it a game I'm proud of in the future<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIm going to be adding a whole array of things from new enemies abilities bloodlines evolutions spells and all that fun stuff.
