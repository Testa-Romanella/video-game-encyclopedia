Later on, at around [REDACTED], multiple witnesses claimed to hear a distant crash of a \u201cunearthly\u201d nature, as well as multiple gunshots.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, a local resident, Mr [REDACTED] has been reported as missing. He was last heard phoning from the nearby town of [REDACTED], and was due to drive back tonight. He is known as a firearms user, it is possible that the gunshots heard were his. We are currently looking into his whereabouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In my personal opinion, Director, I think this is the start of another hunt. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[REDACTED]</p>\n<p>PRESS Q TO CHANGE WEAPONS!</p>\n\n<p>Icon Background Credit : Naran Bayar\u00a0\u00a0at\u00a0https://unsplash.com/@naranbayar_1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a439a00da1c96f40fb7b5d27e5ccd202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EternalSt0rm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
