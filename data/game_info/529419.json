It seems you met with an unfortunate fate while in the land of the living and well, now your here. Sitting at the point where souls are judged and sent into the afterlife. Normally we\u2019d weigh your goods and bads, but that systems getting old and boring. So I\u2019m feeling generous and going to give you the opportunity to decide where you end up down here. All you gotta do is play your cards right and balance your vice and virtues. You can play to walk your way through those golden gates above or you can go down deeper and make a name for yourself among the other sinners, all assuming you do win of course.</p>\n<p>In this duel-based card game: use virtues and vices\u00a0from the consciousness of mankind to overwhelm and dominate the competition. Vice employs a more dominate and deceptive way of getting more power. Through virtue you're rewarded for your goodness and obtain unique abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which side will you choose?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:21:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/8406297e163e3e61bfcfecabd9bfd367.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NounStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
