Use your movement to outmaneuver your enemies and to chain together combos to get the highest score</p>\n<p>Enemies in one dimension show up as a\u00a0silhouette in the other, so use this dimension hopping to get out of sticky situations or to chain together a longer combo. Bigger combos give a higher score, but watch out! The only way to heal is to melee enemies, so be careful on taking damage. Powerups such as shotguns, sniper rifles and a rocket launcher will spawn randomly across the arena to give you an edge in combat.</p>\n<p>Made for the 2022 Global Game Jam.
