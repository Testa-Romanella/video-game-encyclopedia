However, you've got a job to do. Complete the tasks set out to you by your coworkers (making sure to not fall for any scams) - tasks that just keep piling up until they end up <strong>out of control</strong> - all the while finishing that report that you've had all week to do - lest you catch the ire of your boss. Just maybe you'll make it through the day.</p>\n<p>A game by howiie and Angus Beer. Additional music by Will Burroughs.
