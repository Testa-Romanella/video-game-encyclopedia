{"id": 788006, "slug": "tim-tooth", "name": "Tim Tooth", "name_original": "Tim Tooth", "description": "<p>Tim Tooth is one of many mini-games in absolutely wonderful Tux and Fanny from Ghost Time Games. I found myself returning to it quite often completing the main game, and thought it would be nice to have a version that I could keep in my pocket (no, my pockets are not big enough for a Switch). So I made this from scratch for the tiny Playdate console.</p>\r\nRules: \r\n<p>Brush away gunk.</p>\n<p>Connect three bacteria of the same kind to start a chain reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Snacks next to a chain reaction will transform into more bacteria. Each transformed snack gives you another chance to brush.</p>\n\n<p>New snacks will appear in large clumps of grey blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Menu:</strong> \"orientation\" will switch between landscape and portrait modes.</p>\r\nInfo:\r\n<p>You can sideload Tim Tooth onto your Playdate by following Panic's instructions. Alternatively, you can use the Playdate Simulator to try it on your computer.</p>\n<p>The original version of Tim Tooth is a mini-game in Tux and Fanny, which you can grab at one of these places:\u00a0Itch, Switch, Xbox. This Playdate version is just a pale shadow of the original, which has vibrant color and great music.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> the fill routines in this version are not identical with those in the original game, so it's best not to compare scores between the two.</p>\n<p>Big thanks the Albert Birney and Gabriel Koenig for making the original game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/634/63470a2aff0aabf576837ea75c2c1e66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PJ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
