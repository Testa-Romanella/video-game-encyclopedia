You, a cute racoon (definitely not from avengers or something), try to dodge the evil monsters of the dungeon, while waiting for your time to draw a powerful, magical card, letting the enemy burn down in flames ! <br/></p>\n<p>After each round you can improve your deck by up to 3 new cards. The better you play, the more cards you can get ! Only your remaining life points can be traded for new cards. So be fast, be precise and fight your way through the endless hordes of enemies !</p>\n<p>Created by Maarten, Joshua, Krysta and me =)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90b97fc3e14af89f203c335c686c823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luca"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
