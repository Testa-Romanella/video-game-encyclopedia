They all have unique speed and health. Fight off as long as you can and collect coins to get a higher score. OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're surrounded by a bunch of enemies! Don't fear, place a bomb and it will kill any enemy in it's path.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hi, I pretty much made this game in like under an hour and so everything is just basic shapes. If you want actual cool designs and a story to it, comment because I am not very motivated to work on anything right now. I just need a strike of inspiration.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Helpful tip: You move faster when not shooting :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:53:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cdea18b0acd5130aefdff004291205a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArrieBoy22"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
