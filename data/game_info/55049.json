'Whirlwind' Snooker is a highly realistic snooker simulator.</p>\n<p>Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it made full use of the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. ACE said that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-15T23:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/3642c8fac0a8ab0e4cb5beb9b9141d79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
