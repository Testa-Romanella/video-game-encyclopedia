(http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.\u00a0 The game is played\r\non a 5x5 grid, and thus there are 25 caverns, each one adjacent to four other caverns.\u00a0 The grid\r\nwraps around like a torus, similar to the classic arcade game Asteroids.\u00a0  Thus, if you move 5 rooms in any direction, you return to your starting point.\r\n\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>\r\nIn the game, you can move East, West, North, or South.\u00a0 If you are in the starting room, you can also climb up to exit the cave, ending the game.  The game can be played multiple times and the score\r\nis based on the average score of games.  If you exit the game without the the gold, you get zero points.\r\nIf you exit with the gold, you get 1000 points (with the total points divided by the number of games played).  If you get killed somewhere in the caves, you lose 1000 points. <br/></p>\n<p>Each time the game is played, a chest of gold is to be found in a random grid square, but not at the starting point.\u00a0  A wumpus (the evil smelly\r\ndeadly man-eating monster) is in a random square, but not the same as the gold or the starting point.\u00a0 Two additional squares (not the ones with the wumpus or gold or starting point) have bottomless\r\npits in them.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>You have a bow with one arrow.\u00a0 You can face East, West, North, or South, and shoot the arrow.\u00a0  It will\r\nfly up to two squares in the direction you face.\u00a0  If it hits the wumpus, it screams audibly and dies.\u00a0 If not, you have lost the arrow forever and the wumpus lives.\u00a0\u00a0 Note that if you walk in any direction,\r\nyou will be facing that direction when you stop walking.</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you are in the room with the gold, it will glitter so brightly you can see it in the dark cave.\u00a0 You can then pick up the chest of gold and make for the exit to get your 1000 points.\u00a0 If you enter the room with a live wumpus, it will eat you and, of course, you will die, ending the game.\u00a0\r\nIf the wumpus is dead, you will not die, but it will stink in the room.\u00a0 If you enter either room with a pit, you will fall into the pit (since you cannot see it) and\r\ndie of boredom on the way down.\u00a0 You cannot see much, but you do get some warning. \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>When you are in a square adjacent to a wumpus,\r\nyou smell his stench (whether it is alive or dead).\u00a0 You then know it is in one of the four\r\nadjacent squares, but not which one (though of course, you can eliminate the square you entered from).\u00a0 If you are in a square adjacent to a pit, you will feel a cool, damp breeze from air being sucked into\r\nwhat is essentially a vacuum. <br/></p>\r\nStrategy \r\n<p>To play the game effectively, you should draw a map. \u00a0 Just draw a big square, draw two lines to divide it vertically and horizontally, then draw\u00a0 six more lines: two\u00a0 each dividing one vertical half\u00a0 and one horizontal half into thirds, and one each dividing the other vertical and horizontal halves.\u00a0 You now have a 5x5 grid.\u00a0 The start (top left is a good choice) can be marked with an X to indicate it is the exit.\r\nAs you explore, write B in any square in which you feel a breeze, and S in any square in which you smell a stench.  Write E in a square with neither.  It is sometimes possible to deduce the location\r\nor direction of the wumpus or pits, or at least deduce that various squares in certain directions are\r\nsafe. <br/></p>\n<p>So, to the extent possible, explore safe squares, and if you know which way the wumpus is\r\nand know you are within two squares of it, shoot it .  If you can do this, you will eventually find\r\nthe gold and take a safe path back to the start. <br/></p>\n<p>It doesn't always work so nicely!\u00a0  Sometimes there are no safe unexplored spaces left.\u00a0 Then you must make a decision:  is one direction more likely to be safe than another?\u00a0 Is the probability of it being\r\ndeadly low enough you can risk going that way?\u00a0 If not, you might simply backtrack and exit the cave without the gold, scoring zero points, but also losing nothing.\u00a0 Now you see why the game was a subject in an artificial intelligence textbook: a useful AI exercise is\r\nto devise the optional strategy for maximizing the score over several games. <br/></p>\r\nThe User Interface \r\n\n<p>This is a text-based game.\u00a0 The parser is a bit more sophisticated than simple two-word command parsers that understand \"take gold\" or \"look wumpus\".\u00a0 You can type more complex commands just to test if the interpreter can figure it out.\u00a0 Some commands\r\nto try: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>\r\nWalk towards the east </li><li>Face northward </li><li>\r\nPick up the wooden chest of shiny gold </li><li>Describe the smelly wumpus\u00a0</li><li>Climb up </li><li>Quit this game</li><li>\u00a0Show inventory </li><li>I </li><li>Fire your arrow at that wumpus</li><li>\u00a0Show the score </li><li>Turn west </li><li>Shoot the bow</li><li>\u00a0Take the gold </li><li>Look around</li><li>\u00a0Look at the gold </li><li>Attack the wumpus</li><li>\u00a0Describe the dank cavern of the cave</li><li>\u00a0Go up </li><li>South </li><li>S </li><li>L bow </li></ul>\n<p>(note that capitalization does not matter). <br/></p>\n<p>In addition, you can use \"history\" \u00a0to show the most recent commands, or the up and down arrows to select recent commands.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:54:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d9a1cc530da59af1f049f886e94d1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deplorable Mountaineer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
