Up to 4 players. This is a demo-build with only \"Quick Start\" that is a 5 minute match with the small character called Noot. The game is a work in progress.</p><p>You can inhale (block) other characters' shots to increase the power of your next shot. You can also \"rocket jump\" by jumping and shooting down at the same time.</p><p>The balloons that appear are pick-ups, inside these there are three different items: A big ball you can spawn and then inhale to make your next shot a ball which can hit your opponents much further away, an anchor to root yourself to the ground and a bomb to blow away everyone nearby after 2.5 seconds.</p><p>Win by being the one with the most score after the 5 minute match is over!</p><p>Happy hunting!</p><p>/Babloon Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32e/32e73ee1cb7ec0258e46d8bd0bec6414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BabloonStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
