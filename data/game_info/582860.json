Run and save civilians in danger within the blink of an eye, but be careful, the speed won\u2019t always be on your side.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Keep the civilians safe during the whole level while killing the most enemies you can, but be aware, you could lose your civilians too. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Run through the hostages in order to pick them up violently. You are so drunk and in a hurry that the citizens that you rescued can barely hold onto you. Some of them may fall if you don't be carefull. Run around obstacles and defeat bad guys in order to save as many people as possible to earn maximum score !</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Move around with your thumb on the touchscreen/mouse<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Producer : </strong>Ahmed Ben Amor<strong>Digital Marketing : </strong>Lucas Huillet<strong>Game Designer :</strong> Antoine Person<strong>Game programmer : </strong>L\u00e9o Gourves<strong>Game artist (3D &amp; Animation) : </strong>Lucas Bertrand<strong>Game artist (2D) : </strong>Nathan Uranie<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was developped in 4 days by students from the IIM Digital School in Paris during the \"Mobile Game Jam\".
