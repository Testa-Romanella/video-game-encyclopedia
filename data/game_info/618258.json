I was only apart of two other Game Jam's in the past and this was by far the most fun and challenging. I have never made an isometric style game before so I wanted to use this as a learning experience and try something new. I have also never made a puzzle game so\u00a0I wanted to see how well I could do with level design. I hope everyone enjoys the few levels I was able to make in the amount of time we had, I cannot wait for this jam to come around again next year!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:59:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4ccfb78b013bba33945fd36024cdf2fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dr.Gunder_16"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
