For as long as your history knowledge goes, this city has always been here. Shiny from above, it doesn't look as good deep down, where you, Edmund, live.</p>\n<p>Like all people down there, you're not sure wether or not you've eveer seen the light of day, the skies are blocked by the giant skyscrappers when you live in the lower, poorer districts. That's why the most valuable currency is light, without it no one can live, otherwise they are plunged in complete darkness.</p>\n<p>You want to help your community by keeping the neon lights alive. Everyone must do their part, you will go scavenging for items in the black market, your friends will exchange them for neon gas and keep the flame going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>\n<p>Your should go ask your friend to know which items you need to bring back. Since the place is heavily monitored by the law enforcments, they'll talk to you with codenames. Your friend told you they wrote and placed a paper somewhere to help you \"translates\" the demands. Surely it's not too far away.</p>\n<p>You'll be able to collect items through certain activities scattered around that you must complete :</p>\n<ul><li>One will test your timing</li><li>Another one will remind you of your favorite game as a kid, but this time there are more than 4 colors</li><li>Have you ever repaired gears ? Because you will need to place some in the good orders according to their size</li><li>There's a shooting range, some say it's better than AimLab. You're not sure what AimLab is, you never had money as a kid to\u00a0play games</li><li>In this last one, you'll need to be fast enough and dodge everything</li></ul>\n<p>You can only carry 3 items at a time, go back to your friend to check if you've got the right items he asked you. If not, you'll need to go back ! But don't take long, if you start to lag behind you will lose points as the neon light isn't being alimented enough.</p>\n<p>Good luck, some people depend on you.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>AD to move horizontally, WS, when using the elevator.</li><li>E to interact with people or machines.</li><li>All activities are played with the mouse</li><li>Escape will make you quit the game</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>All assets have been made during the Jam;\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game by Datky and Warmiix using Game Maker Studio 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:54:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b38de4e37966cfbbcc83bd5822c885ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Datky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
