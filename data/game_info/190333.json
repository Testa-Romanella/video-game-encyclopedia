But, he needs the minds of hell's other denizens to do so. As he explores their minds one question seems to permeate, \"Why would anyone choose hell over heaven?\"</p>\n<p>The objective of this innovative and philosophical platformer is to reach a goal speed. Meaning small mistakes are fine and there is no restarting or death. After all, Turtle is already dead. Instead players find themselves entering a zen-like flow as they attempt to achieve maximum velocity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/4594481a557dffc409a82175b5091723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sharp7j"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
