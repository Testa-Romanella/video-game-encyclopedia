One night you got alcohol poisoning and you passed out. Because you were running your business unfairly, you were sent to Hell. Satan offered you to beat his 3 best demons in a game of Dice. If you win against them, he would send you back to Earth. You accepted the deal.</p>\n<p>The game includes 3 unique rivals you can defeat by rolling a dice... but there is a catch. You get 3 special dices:</p>\n<p>- High Roll Dice - gives you 20% chance to roll +1 point to your next roll<br/>- Fifty Fifty - you get 50% to either win or lose 3 points\u00a0<br/>- Second Chance - a bonus roll</p>\n<p>These dices can change the course of your battles, either for the better or for the worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your goal - defeat the rivals.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and may the RNG Gods be with you! ;)</p>\n\n\n<p>Developed by:</p>\n<p>Denislav Stoyanov - Core Development</p>\n<p>Ivan Staykov - Level Design and Coding -\u00a0https://twitter.com/AlfredOtosaka</p>\n<p>Rosica Vicheva - Art</p>\n<p>Samuil Getov - Music selection</p>\n<p>Used materials:</p>\n<p><strong>Free Assets from the Unity Asset Store</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Bleeping Demo\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Burnt Spirit\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Leaving Home\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Late Night Radio\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T07:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b3012fb8369c4fece16ccace59bbdaf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AbyzlsDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
