People said the house was still haunted by the ghosts of the wedding that disappeared there decades ago, but if the ghosts knew where the treasure was hidden, I just had to ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's more to the treasure than I could have ever expected, and now I've awakened a household of spirits who don't mind that they're dead, and an evil phantom determined to find the treasure before I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixing the situation won't just mean getting to the treasure first, but also figuring out what happened on the island all those years ago. But I have a feeling that in order to do that, I'll have to die too.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Diary of Murphy McCallan\n</p>\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Game Features:</strong><br/>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic adventure game puzzles, carefully crafted to ensure no dead-ends or deaths</li>\n<li>Over 100 items to pick up and use</li>\n<li>A full-length experience, with a gameplay time equal to Monkey Island and Broken Sword</li>\n<li>Over 70 gorgeous hand-drawn locations at full HD resolution, plus dozens more full-screen paintings, documents, and other details to investigate</li>\n<li>High quality animation from a professional animation studio</li>\n<li>More than 30 fully voiced characters to interact with</li>\n<li>Two hours of original music</li>\n<li>Easy to use two-button interface with double-click exits, optional hotspot highlighting, and a built-in hint system</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T10:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c06da48763c798bad1b468e65ebd4aee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Inklingwood Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Inklingwood Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
