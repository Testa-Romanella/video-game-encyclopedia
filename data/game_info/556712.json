The final player ranking is a combination of score and the time needed to finish the wave. <br/>Depending on the difficulty level you chose each destructed foe will give you a different amount of points (1 on easy, 3 on medium, 7 on hard\r\n and 10 on\u00a0insane, so the maximum score for each difficulty level is fixed.\u00a0f you can kill all the enemies in the wave the game ends and you get a 10xamount of foes bonus (so, for insane, that's 1000\u00a0points)<br/><br/>the controls are left and right arrows to move, space to shoot. Keypad + and - to change the master volume.<br/><br/>Some hints:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The foes spawn one after another with a variable interval (which might be 1/10th of a second, so don't get too cozy). </li></ul>\n<ul><li>They have one shot they will shoot if they pass over your ship. If they pass your ship they will respawn somewhere at the top with one shot (no matter if they shot it before or\u00a0not). </li><li>They will try to avoid your shots too\u00a0btw.<br/><br/>enjoy.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d75cc02b2b6ea8c11d4d53841f2f86f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sammy Fischer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
