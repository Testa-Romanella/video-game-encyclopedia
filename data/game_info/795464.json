Five types of enemies, deadly lasers, your own incompetence and only a grappling hook and physics to deal with it. Good luck :P<br/><br/>Get creative and improve your control, dodge between enemies with more precision than it takes to do surgery on a grape, grab hold of an enemy and use their own laser to kill everyone else or go with the classic and slam your foes into the ground or each other. That's a least like, 3 possibilities (maybe more, I'm bad at math).<br/><br/><br/>Simple description:<br/>You play as a ball with a grappling hook in a small arena. You get points by destroying other shapes, where the shape corresponds to what they do (the triangles shoot lasers). The more points you have, the more difficult the game becomes and when you die, you try again from the beginning. You destroy shapes by grappling them and flinging them at walls or other hard objects.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T05:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8db1210d15050eb1241e0760c083ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLundhoj"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JLundhoj"], "esrb_rating": null}
