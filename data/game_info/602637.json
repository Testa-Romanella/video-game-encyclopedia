Send them on quests or to take part in epic battles! You can even give out your monster code to let people fight against your common or rare monsters (quest monsters are far to rare to let out of your sight!)</p>\n<p>Still want more? Each monster comes with 2 frame animations, unique values\u00a0for their 2 stats based on their level, and a hidden potential meter!</p>\n<p>Make sure you feed and clean your monsters regularly, as if you don't they can die off within 4 days without your care. Favoured monsters can be brought back to life though with the resurrection\u00a0stone (if you can find one)!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game\u00a0Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to select option\r\n</li><li>X or V to select option</li><li>Ctrl+M to turn off sounds</li><li>Enter to option Menu (to toggle mouse support)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Very similar except in the virtual handset\u00a0the O button represents the Z key\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controllers:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>You can use any game controllers recognized by SDL with PICO-8\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Browser Edition:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The free-to-play browser version contains 9 monsters; 3 common, 3 rare, 3 quest related.
