Players can play as Neith, a recently deceased normal person, and must liberate the land from the evil Keeper of the Cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game, you can explore strange worlds, fight challenging enemies and get to know strange companions. As you progress, you'll be able to unlock more playable characters with different characteristics. The Game is relatively short, but its nonlinearity lends itself to multiple playthroughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gameplay is simple. You can walk, run, jump, attack and dodge. The controls are all explained in an optional short Tutorial accessible through the main menu. The game can be played both with Mouse and Keyboard and with a Gamepad. When playing with a gamepad, you must select which driver you are using in the main menu, as Unity has different button Mapping for Xbox One than for Xbox 360 Gamepads.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrailer Music:<br/>\n\"Industrial Revolution\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech)<br/>\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c7df65aefee3810208bbc80ba457b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 108, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Bane Of Asphodel Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Bane Of Asphodel Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
