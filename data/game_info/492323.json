We've got social media channels you can follow to receive updates, news, and even special gifts! Our Facebook page is listed below. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Seong-kuk Yun<br/><br/>\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013<br/>Official Facebook page<br/>https://www.facebook.com/LordofHeroes.Global/<br/><br/><br/>\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013\u3013<br/>Please note!
