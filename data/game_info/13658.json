When you switch away from a track, a computer racer takes over driving on that track for you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, the AI racers aren\u2019t what you\u2019d call competent. They are what you\u2019d call incompetent. In other words, to place well in every track you're racing on, you\u2019re going to have to hop track-to-track on a regular basis to account for the subversively cretinous computer cars.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis Artificial Idiocy\u2122 is uniquely powered by our Intelligent Stupidity\u2122engine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere\u2019s just some of the many other reasons you\u2019re going to love Drive!Drive!Drive!:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Online multiplayer!
