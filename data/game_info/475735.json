Play as Alex, a young adventurer who wakes up alone in the mansion after getting attack by Sara.</p>\n<p>Sara can cause a multitude of things to stop you from completing your goal of escape, such as throwing you back to the enormous foyer of the mansion, and chasing you away from your goals. Will you escape the manor? Or will you perish like the rest of Cobblestone Manor's inhabitants? The choice is yours!</p>\n<p>Anyways, this game was made in a month for the I Can't Write But Want To Tell a Story jam, and can run on an actual gameboy hardware. Make sure the cartridge type is MBC5+RAM+BATTERY. Anyways, that was probably the most I've wanted to slam my fists on the desk out of pure frustration due to the fact that Sara's AI was really hard to code. It made me really frustrated, but hey, it's done.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>WARNING: contains themes of Murder</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/853a4af32d8834948945a7b2ee258f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["REEE2752"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
