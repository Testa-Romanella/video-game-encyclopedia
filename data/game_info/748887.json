Thankfully you found a place that will take you. And good thing too because grandma hasn't been doing too well lately and the cost of treatment isn't cheap...</p>\n<p>At the factory it seems like a main hydraulic automation system is down. You're gonna have to control it manually until things are back in working order.\r\n</p>\n<p>The job is simple enough: control some valves to keep pressure in check and make sure the rest of the systems are in good status. But just keep in mind, this particular factory cares deeply about the level of productivity of all its workers. But you're a good, honest, hard-working man so you'll have nothing to worry about. Hell, once they see just how good you are you'll probably start rising through the ranks in no time.\r\n</p>\n<p>Just be sure to make good choices, grandma knows you will.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD</p>\n<p>Look: Mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>Interact: E or Left Mouse Button\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause / Back (in Menu): Escape\r\n</p>\n\n<p>A playthrough will take approximately 20-45 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbeeda419334a619600c6ba8b519a436.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mell0wD"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
