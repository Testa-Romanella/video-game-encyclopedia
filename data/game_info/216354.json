Anticipation and skill are key as the player's spaceship is often not fast enough to twitch out of trouble at the very last moment.<br/></li><li><strong>Enemies with a bit of personality:</strong> simple emotional states are implemented which affect how enemies behave. For example, each of the enemies chooses to attack the player at a different point in time since being spawned.<br/></li><li><strong>Epic Powerups:</strong> Mega Death Sun and Vicious Red Hole are among those making easy work of the incoming hordes.<br/></li><li><strong>Chance for a good drop mechanic:</strong> as the player progresses through the level and the difficulty increases, good powerups are harder to find and nasty traps start to appear.<br/></li><li><strong>Arcade-style, challenging action:</strong> Due to a degree of unpredictability in enemy behaviour and randomised gameplay elements, it is not possible to truly learn any levels by heart - therefore the player needs to stay focused all the way through every single time.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e44382fe8f07966cf457bec8256fb380.jpg", "website": "https://spacetoadsmayhem.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LimeVibe Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LimeVibe Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
