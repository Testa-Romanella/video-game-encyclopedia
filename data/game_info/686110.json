All graphics are 16x16 and done by myself. Also the music is based and inspired on a midi file (https://bitmidi.com/hungarian-dance-no-5-mid) and finally mixed and done by myself in Garage Band, It is Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 5.</p>\n<p>It is best played with a gamepad but can also be played with a keyboard.</p>\n<p>Gamepad:</p>\n<p>Left Stick to move around, A to jump. D-pad in the main menu. Select/Share to restart.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move around. Space to jump. R to restart.<br/></p><p>The executables are the best experience.
