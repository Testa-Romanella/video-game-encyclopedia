To get an avatar and access to the <em>real world</em>, you have to pass the test.<br/></p>\n<p>Although there is <strong>only one way</strong> to fail it, your scores change every time you take the test even though you picked the same choices.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. At the start of the game, it says that you can go to hyesmo.com to read the dev statement but I didn't have time to edit my webpage.
