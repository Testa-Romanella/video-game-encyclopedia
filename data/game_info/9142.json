Super atmospheric, and very well put together. I love the audio.&amp;quot; - Don&amp;#39;t forget a towel (9.25/10)<br/> <br/>&amp;quot;High replay value with its divergent narratives.&amp;quot; -- App Advice<br/> <br/>&amp;quot;Overall verdict: great, great, great.&amp;quot; -- Lloyd of Gamebooks<br/><br/><br/>-- Pocket Gamer (Silver Award)<br/>------------------------------------<br/>&amp;quot;The kind of deathly sci-fi that you\u2019ll enjoy if you liked Dead Space or the frightening moments of desperation in Gravity.&amp;quot;<br/>&amp;quot;Heavy Metal Thunder is a cruel and unforgiving gamebook. It bashes you against the debris of space over and over, and is happy to leave you at the mercy of all manner of terrors.&amp;quot;<br/>&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a pretty big departure from the usual tone we&amp;#39;ve come to expect from iOS gamebooks, and that&amp;#39;s no bad thing. It&amp;#39;s not quite hard sci-fi, but there&amp;#39;s a bleakness here that you rarely find in a Fighting Fantasy adaptation.&amp;quot;<br/>&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s refreshingly grim, and manages to keep you entertained throughout its hefty running time.&amp;quot;<br/>&amp;quot;Fans of the genre thirsting for something a little darker should definitely give it a look.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>-- Pocket Tactics<br/>--------------------<br/>&amp;quot;A big sweeping pulp sci-fi story of impossible odds and encroaching insanity.&amp;quot;<br/>&amp;quot;I had a lot of fun with Heavy Metal Thunder, and look forward to future installments.&amp;quot;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43fed595276bb0e00b2251dd97926283.jpeg", "website": "http://www.cubusgames.com/sol-invictus", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Cubus Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Cubus Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
