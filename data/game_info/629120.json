As an aspiring screen writer, you submitted your manuscript to a competition at Rat Corporations\u2122 in hopes that yours would stand out. Telling stories of childhood memories, you poured your heart into this script.</p>\n<p>For weeks you waited patiently by the mailbox in hopes that good mail will find your way. After a month of disappointment, the Postman( a little bird) informed you that she heard that Rat\u00a0Corporations\u2122 is using your script without your knowledge and shaping it into something really against your wishes.</p>\n<p>Its time to break in, take those memories back and leak to the world that they are as corrupt as they are!</p>\n\n<p>The game is still in early production so this build is only of one level with the primary focus being on implementing mechanics and the story for the game jam. Further down the line we will be adding more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Jordan Chang<br/></p>\n<p>Luke Cosentino<br/></p>\n<p>Darcie Cotton</p>\n<p>Matt Smith<br/></p>\n<p>Jake van Bockel<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>[WASD] for movement</p>\n<p>[Space] to meow, break from grapple</p>\n<p>[Shift] to sprint</p>\n<p>Walk into items and doors to collect and interact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>First Chase: Background Loop Melodic Techno #03 | Royalty Free Music - Pixabay</p>\n<p>Main Menu: Background Loop Melodic Techno #04 | Royalty Free Music - Pixabay\r\n</p>\n<p>All sound effects obtained through\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d4ded38364546240ee3b8106dfa0e0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Plutonian", "VelenGeth", "twych"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
