It features a highly customizable random level generator, a level editor, more than 70 levels, and an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell.<br/><br/>In Patterna, each level is a network of nodes (also known as a graph). In a way similar to HexCells or Minesweeper, each node is ultimately in one of two states (known as pattern and non-pattern). Initially, most nodes' states are unknown.
