My challenge was to do as much of the graphics as possible using only a fragment shader. In this game you are a droplet of water and you are trying to become bigger by merging with other droplets. You have to avoid red droplets as they are evil and will absorb you!</p><p>The bigger you are, the more speed you have. Your score is the number of droplets you've merged with.</p><p>It's not something I'd call finished and it's a 1 and a half day-ish job, but it was fun!</p><p>This is the downloadable multiplatform version. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfa84b7b13ded976ddb1550e6a33a86f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Metabog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
