{"id": 169876, "slug": "goodbye-kittyexe", "name": "Goodbye Kitty.exe", "name_original": "Goodbye Kitty.exe", "description": "<p>This is a game made by me \"Caleb Scott\" that I for some reason am not calling myself anonymous for this joke of a game. To fill you in on what is happening. You are Hello Kitty (I don't watch the actual show so I don't know her real name, this was inspired by a creepypasta I read called \"The True Story Behind Hello Kitty\"), and you are being chased by your evil self, Goodbye Kitty. In this game (even though you could never get this from the actual game) you are what Hello Kitty was originally meant to be. Cute, sweet, and just a cartoon. But according to the creepypasta a mother made a deal with the devil that she would make a show that would appeal to children while \"unknowingly making them worship satin\". The new Kitty is unbeatable. There are hundreds of duplicates of him. You make your way through some platformer levels until you finally meet him. You can play it to figure out the rest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1a9c29d3c7cccabbd2163b0b10bb62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calebula Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
