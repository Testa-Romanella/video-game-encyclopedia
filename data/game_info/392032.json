The player who collects all the watermelons first is the winner. The others are ranked by their speed and number of watermelons remaining.\n\nThe game is family friendly: Each player can set their own difficulty. Kids and less experienced players get an even playing field versus puzzle geniuses.\n\nThe game supports horizontal Joy-Con layout, so two players can play with one pair.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-04T05:46:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7baac14f58c31f2a6193ff5887113c2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Bigosaur"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
