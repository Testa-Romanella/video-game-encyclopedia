Armed with just your spellbook and staff, you must defeat the countless hordes of beasts standing between you and\u00a0the dungeon's master:\u00a0The Necromancer.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inspired by classics such as Contra and Metal Slug, you must run and gun your way through a classical high fantasy dungeon.
