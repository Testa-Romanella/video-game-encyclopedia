He now lives peacefully with his wife Bouncy in Pi city in the nation Roundes.</p>\n<p>One day, Baller and Bouncy had a small fight and they decided not to see each other for a few days. Baller decided to leave Pi city for a job somewhere else, planning to bring home a gift that would surprise her and as an apology. Little do they both know that something is about to change their whole life.</p>\n<p>The day after, the Trigon nation attacked. The night the country was invaded while Baller was at work. Baller rushed back home to find where Bouncy was and founded that the house was in ruin and Bouncy was nowhere to be found. Desperately searching for Bouncy everywhere within the now destroyed Pi city, he heard from some surviving Rounders (the people of Roundes) that some of his people were captured alive as war hostages, thus he rushed after the Tricers army (Tricers are the soilders of the Trigon nation), in hope of finding his wife and discovering the nature of the invasion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c94ba61a976ac65506487c8a9f26081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hieu0211"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
