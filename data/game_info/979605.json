Sakura is physically frail and spent years in the hospital when she was younger, which is why she\u2019s a year below her sister as a freshman. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, she is unfailingly polite and treats everyone to her gentle smiles\u2014so she\u2019s quickly building a fanbase among the student body. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Fujine Hatoba </strong><br/>Voice: Miya Serizono <br/><br/>The younger Hatoba twin and a second-year student, Fujine adores her sister Sakura so much that she sticks to her like glue whenever they go. Excelling at sports, she\u2019s also in the lacrosse club. <br/><br/>Easygoing and cheerful almost to the point of idiocy, but also naturally beautiful, she\u2019s uninterested in romance despite the number of students with crushes on her. She would much rather focus on sports and, of course, her big sister. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Wakako Suo </strong><br/>Voice: Aoi Kozuki <br/><br/>A third-year student and Miyu\u2019s childhood friend. Having recently arrived as a transfer student, this rich princess\u2019s pride is high; her will, unflinching. <br/><br/>She\u2019s a quick study but not so good at exercise. The younger girls hold her in the highest esteem. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Miyu Tokiwa </strong><br/>Voice: Mari Oda <br/><br/>Miyu, a first-year student, seems cute but can come off as cold and aloof. Her family sold her to the Nishikis\u2019 service after submitting to their power, so she attends St. Martius to learn the maidly arts. <br/><br/>She distances herself from those around her\u2014even Wakako\u2014but only because she\u2019s afraid that she\u2019ll drag them down with her if they learn of her circumstances. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Henrika Mori </strong><br/>Voice: Mikoto Kisaragi <br/><br/>Hailing from Scandinavia, Henrika is Rin\u2019s mother and the wife of Chairman Mori. Still, in her late twenties, she appears younger than she is, making it hard to believe that she\u2019s already a mom. She works as her husband\u2019s assistant and provides foreign language classes to the students part-time. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Rin Mori </strong><br/>Voice: Soyogi Tohno <br/><br/>The half-Japanese daughter of Chairman Mori and Henrika.
