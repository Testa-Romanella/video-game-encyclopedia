Taking \"Difficult gameplay\" to a whole new level - SUPER DISTRO is not for the faint-of-heart. You will die again and again. The weak need not apply - Only those who are determined to overcome impossible odds will find victory here and those are the rules of the land in SUPER DISTRO.<br/><br/>In the words of a certain sour-tasting character from a popular television show: \"We've have it all!\"<br/><br/>\"SUPER DISTRO\" is hopefully unlike anything you've ever played before (We promise that's a good thing!) - Taking familiar staples of excellent games of yesteryear and throwing bucketloads of creativity and innovation (And wall-punching difficulty!) on top; You'll be delighted with the result! Everything has been loving handcrafted by a single guy (With a little help from his friends!) to make sure SUPER DISTRO a stupidly enjoyable, Yet rage-inducing experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/279fee1118d4e376ff94e1373eea461a.jpg", "website": "http://www.kitatus.co.uk/superdistro", "rating": 1.37, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 811, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KITATUS STUDIOS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KITATUS STUDIOS"], "esrb_rating": null}
