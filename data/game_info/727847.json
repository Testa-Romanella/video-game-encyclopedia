Told through self-portraiture, this piece aims to identify what it means to reclaim oneself. How do you fly close to the sun without burning? How do you exist in spaces that once felt safe, but no longer are? How do you become comfortable within your own body again?\r\n</p>\n<p>Each choice you make leads you to a different scene, but the overall outcome is the same. By giving the player autonomy/free will to make their own choices, it forces you to realize that you can\u2019t always control when an episode occurs. You can make all the right choices, but it still happens. It isn\u2019t always up to us.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:51:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e3abb2538ad82dcd07d1d7d24bfe83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["byjoychen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
