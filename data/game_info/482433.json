Ancient stone tablets millenia old litter the outskirts. Whatever has been buried inside has been described as a cruel, vilified king, yet one that nobody dared to try and take off the throne. It is your job to venture deep inside and find out about just what happened so long ago.<br/><br/>This demo is short. VERY short. The game is mainly a prototype for different movement and interaction systems within VR. I might make it longer and add more puzzles later, but this is what was achieved within the given time frame.<br/><br/>Donation is definitely not required, but would likely motivate me in actually making this a more finished product.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15adb0f8ee6ea758f6719a36ca04be0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["k.okkim"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
