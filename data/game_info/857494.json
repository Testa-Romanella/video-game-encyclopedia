But if you do the objective is to get to the other side of the Cabin through the exit near the top Corner of the Room. Don't fall!</p>\n<p>During the Jam I experimented with Blender modelling, sculpting and animations and wanted to try out importing them in Unity. That worked and I am very happy with this initial tryout of the functions. They can be seen on the spider.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designing the Room was fun but I didn't get a chance to make the textures, or add a slew of miscellaneous objects yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the game mechanics are lackluster to say the least. I have some very good ideas to refine them to allow the creature to properly crawl pretty much anywhere it wants.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do plan on working on the game and adding proper functionality to it, as well as fixing the bumpiness. This will be in the upcoming weeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move, Space to Jump, R to reset position in case you flip and Escape to Quit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you did try it out, many thanks!</p>\n<p>If you actually managed to get to the end, well then, that deserves some congratulations as I know it would be quite difficult, at the moment.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:05:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20769a09a61616b5d01b2789c3e812eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GenericParadox"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
