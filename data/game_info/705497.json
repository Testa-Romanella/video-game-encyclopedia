Every year, your advisors will come to you with problems in your kingdom that you must solve using a variety of choices, ultimately attempting to make sure no single pillar rises to the maximum or falls to zero. If you can make it to your 50th year of rule, you are declared a successful leader whose reign will go down in history.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck, mighty Pharaoh!</p>\n<p>This is our final project for Pacific Lutheran University's <em>History in Video Games</em> course, taught by Dr. Michael Halvorson in Fall 2021. We were tasked with creating our own historical video game prototype using Twine, and our group's design in particular was heavily inspired by text-based decision-making games like Reigns. In the future, we would implement conditional events, more leaders to unlock and play as (each with a different bonus ability!), and design events with hidden consequences to the player for extra challenge.</p>\n<p>Enjoy our prototype!</p>\n<p>Created by Alexander Johnson, Seth Koivisto, and Kristin Moniz.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e1dbb9a6770610b224181077fbf099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RAF860"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
