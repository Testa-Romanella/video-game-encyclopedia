{"id": 933100, "slug": "la-porta", "name": "La Porta", "name_original": "La Porta", "description": "CONCEPT\r\n<p>La Porta is an application developed for Oculus that attempts to partially replicate the psychedelic experience, following the ingestion of \u201cmagic\u201d mushrooms. The user will also have the opportunity to learn more about the history, controversies and effects of psychedelics in a fun and new way, guided by a friend in what looks just like a normal room.</p>\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n<p>The application greatly takes advantage of the immersion provided by Oculus, not only to translate into virtual reality some of the effects provided by the ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms, but also to dispense bite-size information about these substances, which often suffer from stigma caused by the lack of knowledge about them.\r\nThe room in which the user is free to move is filled with references to psychedelic-related media, such as books, music CDs/LPs and movie posters. Our main intent is to stimulate the curiosity of the users, offering them a \u201cdoor\u201d to the world of this intriguing topic.</p>\r\n\r\nTUTORIAL\r\n<p>Before starting the actual experience, you have the option to complete a short tutorial which outlines the commands needed to engage with the application. <br/>To sum up:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>TAKE THE OBJECTS :\u00a0</strong>press the left side button of the controllers\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>MOVE : teleport;\u00a0</strong>point your next destination and move the analog stick</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>CHANGE THE VIEW\u00a0: snap turn;\u00a0</strong>move left or right the analog stick</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>CHANGE THE VIEW : turn back;\u00a0</strong>move back the analog stick\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\r\nOUR TEAM\r\n<p>Bresciani Alessandro,\u00a0 \u00a0Dell'Anna Lorenzo,\u00a0 \u00a0Filippetti Luca</p>\n<p>Messina Claudio Giuseppe,\u00a0 \u00a0Rovegno Carolina</p>\n\n<p>\"<strong><em>La Porta</em></strong>\" is a project created for the course \"Realt\u00e0 Virtuale\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0a.y. 2022/2023 -\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/<br/> https://www.cgbookcase.com/<br/> https://www.poliigon.com/ <br/>https://www.textures.com/<br/> https://www.turbosquid.com/it/ <br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/ <br/>https://www.mixamo.com/#/ <br/>https://open3dlab.com/ <br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12db3e74b9b33bb2e57e409946a641ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LaPortaVR"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
