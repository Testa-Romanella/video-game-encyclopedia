But in quite many games, winning just boils down to whoever can click the most. In Ruthless Expansion you have to act fast, but without any micro-management. <br/></p>\n<p>Ruthless Expansion is about building settlements. You can build them anywhere. The units will do the rest - like gathering and fighting - themselves. </p>\n<p>You can expand like crazy. But when should you start attacking or defending? </p>\n\n<p>The game features:</p>\n<p>- Two game modes (low and high money start)<br/></p>\n<p>- Up to four AI players to compete against</p>\n<p>- Three AI difficulty profiles</p>\n<p>- Small to huge map sizes</p>\n<p>- Three biomes, providing different gameplay</p>\n<p>- No manual :D You can find out the subtleties yourself!</p>\n<p>- Supported resolutions from 1024x768 up to 4k </p>\n\r\n\r\n\tEnjoy :)\r\n\n<p>Please share what you think.</p>\n<p>Revenue goes directly to more game development. If there are enough people who like this game, I will remake it with online multiplayer and a campaign. And I'll hire a visual artist to make real art.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7b098cab45be006fee2a3e4a9a4925f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oogbaard"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
