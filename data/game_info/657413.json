The goal of each level is to avoid the obstacles and enemies to reach the treasure. You have a limited number of arrows you can collect each level, and must choose wisely whether you want to use it to destroy the enemy or a destructable wall.<br/></p>\r\nStatus\r\n<p>Snurt's Quest is a game which was made in one week for Blackthornpro GAME JAM #3, but was not submitted in time. It's been sitting on my hard drive for all this time so we figured we might as well publish it. It was made in a week and is very buggy and unpolished in certain areas, so be careful.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in 7\u00a0days\u00a0by the\u00a0following\u00a0awesome\u00a0people:</p>\n<ul><li>Callum Clayton - 3D Artist</li><li>Rupert Cole - Audio Composer</li><li>Fraser Rees - Game Designer</li><li>Rahul Sharma - Programmer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05c3f201762d4e2822e46c6ed6aea314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rahul Sharma", "Fraser Rees"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
