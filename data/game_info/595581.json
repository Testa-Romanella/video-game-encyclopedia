May the most ruthless survive.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<ul><li>Move with WASD or the ARROW KEYS.</li><li>Hide with CONTROL. (Do this next to bushes for extra stealth)</li><li>Shoot with LEFT CLICK. (You need bullets and they make lots of noise, be careful)</li><li>Run with SHIFT. (You are wounded, running will slowly drain your health)</li><li>Use the buttons with RIGHT CLICK. Heal with RIGHT CLICK next to your name.</li></ul>\n<p>Don't let you or your friend succumb to wounds or hunger, or you will die. Stop anytime to HUNT for supplies.</p>\n<p>They'll usually try to check out the place where they heard the shot coming from.</p>\n<p>Avoiding fights is always better.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Made for the Ludum Dare 48! First Ludum Dare ever, and i'm hyped. I think this is my best game yet, it's the most entertaining to me, that's for sure.\u00a0 It's really hard, but i hope some of you can rise up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Game by Stopsignal</p>\n<p>Music by Juanba</p>\n<p>&lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e0c2b320112b1204ac564b61bc768b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stopsignal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
