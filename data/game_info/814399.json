The file size is so large because thats just what winebottler does. Since theres no native way to export an RPGmaker VX Ace game onto Mac, I had to improvise by using winebottler.</p>\n\n<p>Also, when you launch the mac build of the game, the screen might be lowered a bit. Just press option+return (alt+enter) to enter fullscreen. That seems to fix it.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the MacOS build might not work on M1 chips, I've only tested it on an Intel chip running Big Sur.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T11:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99be6f36f9bed10cb16f7200888020cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ratintosh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
