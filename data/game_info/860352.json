It's fairly short. And, crucially, it has cats in it. <br/></p>\n<p>I made this funky little experience for a school project a few years ago, and it is my most complete game that I've made to date. It's definitely rough around the edges, but I'm fairly proud of it! I hope to make an improved version someday down the line, but in the meantime, this is the game in its original form. <br/></p>\n<p>For more information about the game, including how to play, please see the text documents included with the game's files. And, good luck~!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T16:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c72/c727196ee84e8bb5d3166e08140ceb5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Semudara"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
