In this prototype, the cellular automaton takes on the form of grid tiles to simulate evolution determined by states. Each tile interacts with its neighboring tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. However, there are added twists. The system does not achieve true cellular equilibrium necessary for life, but rather works against you. <strong>Figure it out!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left-Mouse Click</strong>\u00a0to interact with tiles</li><li>Living tiles with too few neighbors die</li><li>Living tiles with too many neighbors die</li><li>Dead tiles with enough neighbors revive</li></ul>\n<p>The specifics aren't necessary.
