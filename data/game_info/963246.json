Meant to make you waste time (in a good way) and make you enter in a state of flow where you only want to destroy the skull of those freaks, just so you can be a little bit higher on the online leaderboard, and show off how much you don't like to go outside! Game may seem simple at first, but there's a lot of hidden mechanics and a lot to discover by yourself about the gameplay of this game! Perfect for those times where you have nothing to do!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Doomies is designed to be a very simple game to get into, but hard to master, you'll always find out new ways to unlock upgrades, and new ways to kill and get lots and lots of points! The levels also get a little bit modified every time you play on them, so the experience isn't the same every time you play!<br/><br/>[url]Features<br/><br/><ul><li>Unlockable guns<br/></li><li>Different playable characters<br/></li><li>Voice acting<br/></li><li>Online leaderboard<br/></li><li>A freaking ton of blood<br/></li><li>Loud and punchy gun sounds<br/></li><li>Satisfying and badass gameplay<br/></li><li>Metal music<br/></li><li>And a lot of fun goddammit!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-14T03:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fef3de6300506774ccfaa35694189ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brain-dead Rabbit"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Brain-dead Rabbit"], "esrb_rating": null}
