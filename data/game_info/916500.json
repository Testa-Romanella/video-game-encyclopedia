The game supports online combat.<br/>\r\n3. There are more than 20 units in the game. In the real-time strategy mode, the units that players can unlock are related to their upgrade routes, which makes the game more strategic and more interesting.<br/>\r\n4. Players do not have to consider the collection of resources. Resources will increase automatically over time, so that players can concentrate on the control of units.<br/>\r\n5. When the resources accumulate to a certain value or the population increases to a certain value, the collection speed of resources will slow down, which requires players to make a reasonable balance between the accumulation of resources and population and the collection speed of resources.<br/>\r\n6. The chess mode is divided into preparation phase and combat phase. In preparation phase, the player deploys the unit to the designated position. In combat phase, the player can not carry out any other operations on the unit except controlling the unit to release skills. The unit will automatically attack the enemy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T02:55:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f854c6b0684d99d316862f7de50337c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yang Sun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yang Sun"], "esrb_rating": null}
