It is a test of techniques to create a turn-based combat game using dice rolls, much like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder.\u00a0 Behind the scenes, the game uses a dice roll mechanic based on the \"character sheet\" of each character to determine the results\u00a0 and damage. Additionally, the project uses Navmeshes alongside a threat level system in order to create rudimentary tactical behaviour for the AI opponent, giving them the option to flee, parry, counter, or attack, based on how well they are performing relative to the player.</p>\n<p>This game later led to more player-vs-AI games, and helped me gain and demonstrate new skills in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6bd363797c68c7bca14b5767dfa020d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FuzzyLogician"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
