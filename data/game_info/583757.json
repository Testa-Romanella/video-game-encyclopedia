As of now, you can only play the first chapter of the Sasuke and Bakugou routes. The others will likely crash the game!</p>\n<p>This is a completely self indulgent game I've been learning to use Renpy on.\u00a0 Basically, you're on a new reality show (not unlike Bad Girl's Club or Celebrity Big Brother) with a collection of Anime characters. I don't plan on continuing this because I wanted to work on an original game, but I may come back and continue with this. Until then, here's what I have :)</p>\n<p>I don't own any of the characters, background art or any sounds/music used for this game. The art of the characters were done by me\u00a0and edit some of the images used as props, but once again I did not create them.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T00:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fd/5fd9d7256a69e8cefe39ea1bf1afcd6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["K80Chimaera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
