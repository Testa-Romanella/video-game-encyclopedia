The walking around part is very simple, and so is the battle system for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Battle System:</strong><br/> </p>\n<p>It's sort of like an avoiding obstacles game, but you are on 1 of 5 tracks. You must go back and forth between these tracks whilst firing your weapon at an opponent above. You have a secondary weapon which breaks incoming obstacles and does more damage to the opponent above, but it is on a cooldown timer. There are also intermittent powerups and a few varieties of obstacles. Once the opponent at the top runs out of health, you win. If you run out of lives, you try the battle again.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Walking Around:</strong></p>\n<p>A simple top down-ish map with buildings that can be entered. There are also objects and characters which cause dialogue to be shown when interacted with. encounters are not random, but it is impossible to tell at some points where an encounter will occur.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Story\":</strong></p>\n<p>I'm not exactly experienced when it comes to writing a story, so this one is bound to be seen as ameraturish, It serves only as a context to the battle system. but I enjoy some of the dialogue, so I hope you get something out of it too.</p>\n<p>The game is about 15-20 mins long (in my experience).</p>\n\n<p><em>Note:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the game saves on exit</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Any of the characters which do not look like they were drawn by a caffinated monkey were drawn by my partner, who wanted to contribute a little to the project.</p>\n<p>Other than that everything is my own, I used the monogame framework to make the game. \u00a0I used photoshop for the visual aspects, and I used tiled to do the maps.</p>\n<p> There is no music because I have empathy for your ears.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f3a366fd070cde3f13ae73002e2e1c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NoamZeise"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
