This is a perfectly routine mission in your line of work. You expect no difficulties. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The game is best played on desktop</strong>, using a a downloadable version. However, it <em>will</em> work in your browser - and even on your smartphone, if you're ready to accept some glitches.<br/></p>\n\r\n[ ABOUT ]\r\n<p>ICEBOUND MACHINES is a short sci-fi adventure game. It has a selection of quirky characters, and deals with themes of community, loss, healing, and living in your own head too much. Note that this includes some (discussed/implied) loss and self-harm.</p>\n<p>For a list of credits and assets used, please see credits.txt or the in-game credits screen.</p>\n\r\n[ BASIC CONTROLS ]\r\n<p>This information is also available in-game.</p>\n<p>The game is controlled mostly via mouse. LEFT-CLICK\u00a0to\u00a0walk\u00a0or\u00a0interact,\u00a0RIGHT-CLICK\u00a0to\u00a0examine\u00a0things. You can also press TAB on your keyboard to show interactable objects.<br/></p>\n\r\n[ KNOWN ISSUES ]\r\n<p>You may notice the cursor jumping around in cutscenes and in level transitions. This is part of a workaround for an engine bug. (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4162) Likewise, the mouse cursor might not always visibly react when over hotspots. In that case, just wave the mouse around a bit, you'll get there. Sorry!</p>\n\r\n[ CREDITS ]\r\n<p>This game uses, remixes or adapts a lot of CC-licensed graphics. The assets are listed below in no particular order, and can be found on OpenGameArt.org. If something isn't listed, it's probably by me.
