It means: no weapons, no bonuses, and you can\u2019t even attack. At start you only can move. You should find a weapon or it will be very hot. Good luck!</p>\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it :)\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. It was very hard and stressful some essential features are not completed. Only core gameplay. So I need to explain that\u00a0<strong><strong>weapons drops only when enemies collides with you</strong></strong>\u00a0and it has some chance to drop.\r\nP.P.S. Dialogs should exlpain it for you, but it didn\u2019t finished. Also like other weapons/enemies and etc\u2026\r\n<p><em>Thanks to arsher, Music was made by him</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42ce679bc06cf2ca131f28279c6cf209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SneakyFoxDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
