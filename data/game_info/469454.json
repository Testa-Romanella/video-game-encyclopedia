The name was made in honor of Raspy Goo's lack of creativity, when he named the main character sprite simply- Guy. We then went on to name all of the sprites in a similar manner- Guy2, GuyJump, etc... When it came time to choose the name, we looked at the sprites, and the name came easily.</p>Creators<p>The Adventures of Guy was made by Second Last Studios, specifically Fireye, Meme8383, and Raspy Goo. Fireye and Meme8383 coded the game while Raspy Goo made the art.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e380abe8a0b2fd5086d0e115be9ba78c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meme8383"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
