The reason for this being an alternative\u00a0is that it works in the opposite way of a normal FPS. Instead of trying to shoot players with bullets to kill the other shapes in the world, the player is meant to keep them alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player throws colourful blocks at them to increase their health, but by doing this, the player's health decreases. To increase it again, the player picks up cute and meaningful\u00a0items around the island.</p>\n<p>Date: September 2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/684cb7ff69e7a316fa0ddf371c90c739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Payal Chana"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
