The project is 18 weeks long and is scheduled to end on July 7th 2021. CurseBound is a hack and slash adventure in spooky dark ruins! You play as an adventurer who stumbled across these ruins and is unable to leave until they break the curse!</p>\n<p>Click Here to view the team CurseBound page!<br/></p>\n<p>In this project I am a part of a lean team of interdisciplinary\u00a0specialists. We each had a diverse set of responsibilities, and these are some of mine:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0My main role is the systems designer. I work with the programmers to make sure all systems we create are compatible with each other. This also involves balancing the game.</li><li>I am also a backup programmer. Our game has many systems that need to be created. The four most intensive and demanding tasks were given to our two programmers to work on throughout the project. Until they finish their tasks,\u00a0the rest fall mostly on me to execute. I created the save system, the randomized room decoration system, the interactable object systems, and more.</li><li>I am also a bug hunter. There are many things that can go wrong in any given part of a videogame. Finding and fixing these issues has been primarily my responsibility.</li><li>I am also a level designer. I taught two other members of my team how to use the randomized room decoration system I created, and then we each created several variations of decorations to fill each type of room. Using this system, I created many interesting battlefields for the player to wade through.</li></ul>\n<p>The downloadable game below is our alpha release. As the project continues I will add our iterations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68e/68e16382840591827e82d016a7aa1fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MinotaurBattleMaster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
