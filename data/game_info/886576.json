{"id": 886576, "slug": "simple-sprinter", "name": "Simple Sprinter", "name_original": "Simple Sprinter", "description": "<p>Simple Sprinter is my first actual game that I'm making (I'm using unity instead of scratch). It's a platformer game that contains plenty of enemies that have their fair share of strange properties that get\u00a0used in multiple ways. To progress, you have to reach the finish line at the end of each level. There are 3 levels in each world and so far there are 2 worlds but I play on adding a whole lot more in the future. My end goal is to get this game put up on steam (and maybe even the playstation store)\u00a0for free for anyone to play. Sadly, it costs $100 to upload a game to steam, which is money that I don't have, so any money earned from donations will go straight to that fund. Please leave any feedback in the comments.\u00a0Thank you and I hope you enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/1387f3447143bf11d7bd4fb22a6bcfae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItisConn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
