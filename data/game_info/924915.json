Many energies and spirits from other dimensions are always lurking. However, the first intruder in the forest does not come for its immeasurable power, this stranger would have found the forest by coincidence, it is the spirit of rot Naberius who wants to bring his glorious decay to every corner of the universe. <br/><br/>This spirit travels with his army preaching disease and corruption wherever he can reach. It is the task of the spirit of the forest to defend Rizes from Naberius' influence, before he ends up delighting in spreading his loving pestilence in the purest, most beautiful and clean place he has ever known. <br/><br/>The spirit is not alone and has the support of many of the creatures in the forest, which will help defend this ancestral energy that is in grave danger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T18:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/9059a0e35e0a9f920ea9d7a50f6c01d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Media Collab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
