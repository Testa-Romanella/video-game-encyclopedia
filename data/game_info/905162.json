For these artworks, it is important to see the work in the context of its painterly evolution,\u00a0 scale, and impact on the viewer. I am also developing an interactive studio where viewers can interact and see new work in progress. A handy addition for clients who commission artwork to view its development.</p>\n<p>This project is constantly evolving. I hope you enjoy the work so far.</p>\n<p>Chris Farrell</p>\n<p>Instagram: @farrellartist<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T10:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c68511178304db4de6153a0e2b1eae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["farrellartist"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
