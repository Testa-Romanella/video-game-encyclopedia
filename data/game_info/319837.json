That's right, even in the future things still need repairing. In a very large, very desolate desolate canyon, you must drive around to various locations and fix the drills there. Be careful though, drills are very loud and like to attract some of the planet's residents. Don't stay too long, else be overwhelmed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interesting soundscape</strong> immerses you in the experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Satisfying driving</strong> mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Proof of concept</strong>, so more content can be developed!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD\u00a0 - movement / driving</p>\n<p>E - interact</p>\n<p>R - reload</p>\n<p>LMB - shoot</p>\n<p>L Shift - run</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>References</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Vehicle Sound effects sourced ||\u00a0 outdoor_recordings, 2016. <em>lift truck</em>.
