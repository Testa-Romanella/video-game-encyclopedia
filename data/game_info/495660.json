The task you've been given is to find various things that have been hidden inside buildings, behind trees, and inside containers. See if you can find em all!<br/><br/>This virtual reality game is actually a prototype I made for a larger game I've started working on. I wanted to see how complex a world I could make in VR without the framerate dying. Turns out, pretty darn complex! Not only that, I wanted to create something that allowed someone to really explore an interactive miniature world. I spent so much time on it that I wanted to give people a chance to try it out themselves. It's a fairly short game, maybe a half hour long, so I decided to offer it for just a small amount.<br/><br/>If you had a good time visiting this world and know someone with VR who might also enjoy going exploring, please let them know about this! I really want as many people to enjoy it as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T02:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e577ec0463629aef2ebc5b18a2d262.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glass Kettle Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glass Kettle Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
