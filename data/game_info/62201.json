You get transported to his secret lair and won't be able to get out until you show mastery!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first-person game \"Kirchhoff's Revenge\" teaches the basic concepts of electrical circuits; players need to solve puzzles by assembling macroscopic circuit elements such as batteries, light bulbs, wires, volt meters, and ampere meters. These circuit elements snap together into functional, three-dimensional structures. Moving \"charges\" are indicated, so as opposed to real circuit elements, currents are visible. Puzzles increase in difficulty and complexity, while side rooms and pre-assembled circuits offer opportunities to learn new concepts. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame play is strictly based on solving puzzles, there are no dexterity or timed challenges. Once players succeed, they actually get a Schwarzw\u00e4lderkirschtorte, which they may dispose off as they see fit. The cake is not a lie.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has been used in physics courses at the high school and introductory college level, and it is now made available as Early Access to the wider community.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fb20393ec362a44184886bafa7965dd.jpg", "website": "https://msu.edu/user/kortemey/kirchhoff.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 113, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gerd Kortemeyer et al."], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michigan State University"], "esrb_rating": null}
