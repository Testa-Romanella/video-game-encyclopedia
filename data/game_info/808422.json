(Except for iOS) It allows users to create custom maps (GAMEMODES), and there is going to possibly be a map creator in the future.\r\n </p>\n<p>You can customize BA and make it yours, with custom characters, sounds, and much more.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you feel that BA doesn\u2019t contain the feature you would like, it is open source and you can contribute any feature you would like, or, if you prefer to keep it private, you can do that too :)\r\n </p>\n<p>BA is written with performance in mind, any realism features are only enabled if the user wants them.\r\n </p>\n<p>And: you can create fancy experiences for your downloaders.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:32:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e71f98f634206fd222f9d5b227d75a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Kaigonzalez"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
