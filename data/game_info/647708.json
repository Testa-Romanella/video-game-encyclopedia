{"id": 647708, "slug": "colibricks", "name": "Colibricks", "name_original": "Colibricks", "description": "iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad version of the popular Macintosh brick breaking game. Destroy the bricks by bouncing up one or more balls. Contrary to other similar games, these balls actually behave like real balls, bouncing off corners correctly and even colliding with each other. Colibricks also features rotated bricks, so instead of boring horizontal grids you'll get circles, spirals, and so on.<br/><br/>Many kinds of special bricks will grow or shrink the paddle, give you extra lives, points or equipment like the magnet or laser, and even change the size of the balls so you'll sometimes end up with a screen full of balls of different sizes (and corresponding weights). Some bricks will actually try to shoot your paddle, so stay away from those arrows!<br/><br/>Colibricks features 50 different levels, many of them requiring different strategies so that your score depends on skill and cleverness rather than luck. Gameplay is extremely smooth. The paddle can be controlled by touch or tilt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T03:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/1855c335adc800c35958b6a0dbad4991_VRzdwnF.jpg", "website": "http://www.colibricks.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michel Colman"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Michel Colman"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
