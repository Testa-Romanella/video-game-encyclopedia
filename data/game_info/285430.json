You were never born for greatness. And yet, for some reason fate has woven you into the company of The Chosen One. Will you help The Chosen One fulfill his destiny? Or will you keep quietly to yourself in town? The choices (and their lasting consequences) are yours to make!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:28:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e6309aa493f43aa3cf442bf02cbeb6cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rekystudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
