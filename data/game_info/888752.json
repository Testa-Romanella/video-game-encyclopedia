It was the strangest action adventure I ever played, and almost definitely religious propaganda of some sort, but\u00a0inexplicably, I'm recreating it in Unity.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's my cover story. In game, the story seems to be about the horrible conditions that might occur if \"furries\" come into reality; beings who are humanoid animals, genetically.\u00a0 Interestingly the main character is said to make a game herself, but I wonder if she's just a Mary Sue. I replaced some of the dialog to make it more relevant today.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is unusual in that it's a platformer with bullet curtain elements. It looks like an I Wanna be the Guy fangame, now that I think of it. But I'd still call it an action-adventure, sure. Sorry if it isn't too accessible, but maybe you can find\u00a0\"hidden test\" useful.</p>\n<p>So far I just managed to recreate the demo mode, which activates when you set a flag in the save block. This was also strange because it implies internal distribution and experimentation.</p>\n<p>If you dare to play it yourself, it's here now. There are lots of secrets to find. Good luck. I will complete the rest of the game faster depending on how many donations I receive, but I don't expect much. How much does $ really matter?</p>\n\n<p>Default controls: keyboard</p>\n<p>WASD = D-pad</p>\n<p>Space = X (Jump/Confirm)</p>\n<p>/ = Square (Weapon/Cancel)</p>\n<p>. = Circle (Melee)</p>\n<p>, = Triangle (Item)</p>\n<p>Q = L1</p>\n<p>E = R1</p>\n<p>1 = L2</p>\n<p>3 = R2</p>\n<p>Esc = Start (Pause menu)</p>\n<p>~ = Select (Inventory)</p>\n<p>If you don't like it, remap it in the settings menu. There is a Unity bug in which she thinks the arrow keys are all Print Screen; if that happens, press Num Lock and try rebinding again.</p>\n\n<p>youtube showcase, for music and gameplay previews:</p>\n<p>https://youtube.com/channel/UCb6H9d-lJat859Tocan31lQ\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0gamedev server\u00a0</p>\n<p>\r\n https://discord.gg/GBEPhjW6S8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0panhandling</p>\n<p>https://ko-fi.com/aktaion<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab42392f7542ef61f2f0226bc801ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["aktaionh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
