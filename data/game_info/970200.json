Witness complex physical interactions and emergent behavior.<br/><br/>PARTICULATE simulates millions of tiny particles using the massive parallel processing power of VR-capable graphics cards. Built using a new and fully-custom engine for high performance, PARTICULATE is a physics sandbox but also a fully-fledged creative tool.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> View featured scenes when you just want to relax and watch cool stuff happen.<br/></li><li> Build and save your own scenes when you're feeling creative.<br/></li><li> Interact with particles using ten tool types:  several particle emitters, the Attractor/Repeller, Orbiter, Collision Sphere, Distortion Field, Colorizer, Dragger, and Stirrer.<br/></li><li> Tools can be placed into scenes statically, or you can record (and loop) their motion using a simple press-move-release mechanic.<br/></li><li> Turn on Audio Reactivity and play your own music (using any app) to add a new dimension to any scene.<br/></li><li> Build (and save) particle \"sculptures\" - static scenes with no placed emitters.<br/></li><li> Use \"Freestyle Mode\" to jump in quickly and interact with automatically-regenerating particles (works well as a demo for new VR users!)<br/></li><li> Take an optional guided tutorial to learn how to use the app.</li></ul><br/><strong>Note that PARTICULATE currently supports only Oculus VR headsets</strong> (using the native Oculus SDK). This is due to the app having been built on a custom engine, which makes porting to SteamVR non-trivial (though that should happen eventually).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T03:58:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a7/3a76aedf85e2a669e20ebc46efbeb605.jpg", "website": "https://miketuritzin.com/particulate/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Turitzin"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Mike Turitzin"], "esrb_rating": null}
