What about a Russian dog astronaut cursing in the afterlife? Laika kinda match the profile and she also happens to be the protagonist of this puzzle adventure game.</p>\n<p>After being sent into space she will find herself exploring some small asteroids, meeting weird and ambiguous characters and solving puzzles in order to figure out what the hell is happening. The big question is: is she dead? Probably yes, but that\u2019s not a big spoiler, so maybe the big question is not really that one.</p>\n<p>I started working on this game during the first lockdown,\u00a0 in March 2020, writing\u00a0the code and the story and drawing the graphics.</p>\n<p>I know that the PC version is not perfect (some day maybe I will release also the mobile one, that was the main one in theory), so I decided to release the game for free even if I have to admit it required quite some work. So well, if you will like it and feel up to you can send a small donation. Otherwise not, it's fine anyway. But if you liked it and you want to write a comment, that's something that would be very appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing I hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n<p>P.S. if you want this is my Twitter, not that I use it much...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T04:55:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b8/6b887b7528e8fdaba1ae96b843ed9de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Quail"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
