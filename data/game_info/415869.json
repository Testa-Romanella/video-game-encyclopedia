However, this is for the best - this is not the best engine for platformers. If you have an old hardware, you will experience problems with collisions. There is still a couple of bugs that I, unfortunately, can\u2019t fix, but nothing critical - the demo is passable to the end. Recently found, and decided to upload. Why not? I like the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The game is a metroidvania, where you run, jump and shoot. There are a couple of bosses and puzzles. You are a sandrunner, in the post-apocalyptic future, who is supposed to deliver a letter (ideally, but the plot will never reach this point).</p>\n<p>Attention! Rude words are present!
