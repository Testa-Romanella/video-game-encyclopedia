I opted for GUI based on the time frame,\u00a0I figured that going full top-down style would be too time-consuming and I would spend hours just looking for the right assets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the assets used in this project were made by me, apart from the Horse which was made by one of my friends.\u00a0Said friend also lent some advice on fixing some of the bugs that were present in the original version, so shout out to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I used a font called Gameplay, I don't know who made it, but thanks to them as well.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all the features of this game should be working, if you have any questions or find any bugs please let me know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. Amalee Helped a bit maybe.</p>\n<p>This version is designed for Windows 10 64-bit and was made using Unity Version 2021.2.8f1 and Visual Studio 2019.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T16:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01b75cc8d14a0cc246d98120b69a1aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Z0mbie001"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
