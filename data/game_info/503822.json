An endless shooter with bullet hell and reverse tower defense influences.</p>\n<p>Auraboros is an audio game best experienced with headphones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Auraboros does not have a tutorial. Its mechanics are designed to be discoverable after a couple plays. If you're confused or want to learn more, then reveal the spoiler below for a detailed explanation:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSpoiler Warning\r\n<p>The game is set within a circular arena. Its boundaries are softly defined by white noise. Move outside them and you'll cease to accrue points. The noise is strongest when facing the wrong way.</p>\n<p>You begin in the center of the arena. Directly ahead is the first wormhole. When facing wormholes an audio cue turns from a constant tone to a beep to indicate they are target locked and in range. Fire at it repeatedly to close it. Wait too long and the wormhole will open large enough to send rival black holes your way.</p>\n<p>Black holes have destructive powers that will end your game with any collision. They constantly chase you but can be destroyed with a single shot. When they're destroyed, active wormholes will eagerly send reinforcements.</p>\n<p>An alert is played whenever new wormholes open within the arena. It's positioned in their general direction. You can leverage their directional cues to scan the area and locate their exact positions. Over time the difficulty gradually increases as more wormholes become active at once.</p>\n<p>Your score is a function of time and destruction. Every second it increments a point. Destroying a black hole rewards five points. Closing an active wormhole adds 250 points. If you manage to close a wormhole before it's active, then you'll be rewarded another 250 bonus points.</p>\n<p>While the game can be played by staying stationary in the center and turning to shoot your opponents, you may discover that a strategy of running and gunning may be more appropriate. With the movement controls you move and react faster than incoming black holes, allowing you to manipulate their gravity to maintain an upper edge.</p>\n<p>To be successful with Auraboros you must stay moving, stay shooting, and prioritize closing newly opened wormholes. Good luck!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Auraboros supports a variety of input devices with controls that are comparable to standard first-person shooters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nKeyboard controls\r\n\r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Action\r\n                Key 1\r\n                Key 2\r\n                Key 3\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Move Forward\r\n                W\r\n                Up Arrow\r\n                Numpad 8\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Move Backward\r\n                S\r\n                Down Arrow\r\n                Numpad 5\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Strafe Left\r\n                A\r\n                Z\r\n                Numpad 4\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Strafe Right\r\n                D\r\n                X\r\n                Numpad 6\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Turn Left\r\n                Q\r\n                Left Arrow\r\n                Numpad 7\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Turn Right\r\n                E\r\n                Right Arrow\r\n                Numpad 9\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Eject Particle\r\n                Space\r\n                Control\r\n                Numpad 0\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                UI Confirm\r\n                Enter\r\n                Space\r\n                Numpad Enter\r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nMouse Controls\r\n\r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Action\r\n                Button\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Turning\r\n                Mouse X-Axis\r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Eject Particle\r\n                Mouse 1 (Primary)\r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nGamepad Controls\r\n\r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Action\r\n                Button 1\r\n                Button 2\r\n                Button 3\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                Move Forward\r\n                Any Stick\r\n                D-Pad Up\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Move Backward\r\n                Any Stick\r\n                D-Pad Down\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Strafe Left\r\n                Left Stick\r\n                \r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Strafe Right\r\n                Left Stick\r\n                \r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Turn Left\r\n                Right Stick\r\n                D-Pad Left\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Turn Right\r\n                Right Stick\r\n                D-Pad Right\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                Eject Particle\r\n                Left Trigger\r\n                Right Trigger\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                UI Confirm\r\n                A\r\n                Start\r\n                Select", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8254ca7b0b9455be2684d9816071a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["shiftBacktick"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
