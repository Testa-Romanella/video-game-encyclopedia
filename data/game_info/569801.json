Which means that <br/>you are innacurate when you move, you shall not aim down sights<br/>and you only walk and dont run. I Did that on purpose cause i didn't wanna change<br/>my playstyle because im a valorant player myself. For Many reasons the game will not have blood and gore not now and not on the final release. It is not a horror game it is just supposed to be fun.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The game obviously is gonna have a lot of bugs due to the fact that Im a Solo developer with 0 budget and Mayhem it's not even a thing yet, and i Dont know if it will be, however this and the final release will be for free and will always be for free with Donations accepted ofcourse. This is a short demo and the full release will include a small survival campaign based on the lore which you can read below  and the original time survival mode. The longer you survive ,the better player you are above the others. This is just a preview and in any case doesn't represent the final product.<br/>Many of the things you see here can and will be probably changed.<br/><br/>The game was Made with unreal engine and content from the store.<br/><br/>What to expect:<br/>A Short campaign.<br/>Time survival mode.<br/>Beta version.<br/>Full Release probably more than 7 Months<br/><br/>*Bunny hopping gives you a bit of boost also has no sound<br/>*Antizombie vest disintegrates ALL zombies on its flying path<br/><br/><br/>Anti-Zombie vest.<br/><br/>Part of your equipment is your antizombie vest it has a spring loaded mechanism<br/>that shoots a capsule integrated spike strip that disintegrate ALL Zombies on Contact<br/>Unfortunatelly this cannot be applied to bullets due to gunpowder explosion.<br/>Press F to activate your vest. Keep in mind that it has a 30 second cooldown and <br/>should be used wisely and in case of Emergency.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lore<br/></p>\n<p>The Year is 2090 and the whole world is in chaos from an illness that turns people and dead bodies to ZOMBIES<br/>\u00a0all Nations are under military law and require all young men to join the army in order to fight this crisis.<br/>\u00a0Civilians have baricaded their homes and the army has created safe zones, and walls. So the Big cities are well and the army does everything \u00a0it can to keep them safe, however people are instructed to stay home at night. It is difficult to sleep sometimes from \u00a0the weapon firing, looks like every couple of Days people are attacked by a horde.<br/>\u00a0Scientists have come to the conclusion that this happened from an illness created by humans in a lab, which that alone<br/>\u00a0puts us all in danger, we don't know who has done this and probably never will.<br/> <br/>You are a nato soldier flying on a civilian assistance mission, midway the drone carrying you crashed due to battery failure.<br/>\u00a0It flew for months with the reserve battery and none had noticed, however your parachute managed to save you but the only thing you have on you<br/>\u00a0is your gun and your anti-zombie Vest, you have landed in a forest but looks like it hasn't been explored cause there is no way of getting in,<br/>\u00a0therefore no way of getting out, its in high altitude so there is always snow and cold there, you look around and you see some WW2 relics<br/>\u00a0they have texts and symbols from that era but it is all written in German so you don't know how to read it.</p>\n<p>You encounter some dead bodies from that era, the cold has preserved them in a relativelly good shape, they still have their uniforms on.<br/>\u00a0Looks like they are all German Officers, what is this place ? how did they all Die ? You wonder. Some things indicate that someone else had \u00a0been there before you and these are a couple of tracks been all over the place that obviously do not belong to the '40s.</p>\n<p>But since the forest can't be accessed by foot you assume that the trucks got delived there by a drone, 2 of the trucks have crashed and 1 looks<br/>like it was evacuated, but what happened ?. This forest 95% chance that it has a secret camouflaged gate you bet. Something in your head tells you<br/>that this forest and the illnes are linked so very briefly you save the co-ordinates in your watch.</p>\n<p>What was that ? oh no!. Looks like the dead are upset by your presence and have turned to zombies, it is not something uncommon for you but.. you are<br/>\u00a0all alone and you have nothing except a handfull of bullets and the rest of your equipment, you need to find your radio and call for an evacuation<br/>\u00a0until then you are assumed to be Missing or Dead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Credits<br/>Zombies: Mixamo<br/>music: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8e6a0d74f1241d02693f19c83a60c2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mario \"Dolleran\""], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
