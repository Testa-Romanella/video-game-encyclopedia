Have the ability to <strong>S</strong><strong>wap </strong>the order of your cards and change fate?!?! But wait... your opponent can do the same??</p>\n\n<p>After Word:</p>\n<p>There isn't really anything exciting or explosive here - just a small, simple and chill game were you play rock paper scissors against the AI in card form (with lofi music!).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Admittedly, this would be a much better concept for a multiplayer game where the players are able to communicate with each other to be able to use the power of<em> lies and deceit</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will I add more to the game in the future?
