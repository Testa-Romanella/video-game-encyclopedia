You can get more health by shooting enemies, but here's the tricky part, in order to shoot enemies you need bullets. You get bullets by finding small light pieces, in order to find the light pieces you have to move, and when you move you lose even more health.</p>\n<p>Move too much and you risk losing all your health. Move to little and you risk not having any bullets to shoot with, which means that you can't get any health back.</p>\n<p>You have to balance the amount you move with the number of light pieces you get out of it.</p>\n<p>And to make things even more fun, the lower your health the bigger multiplier, which means you get a higher score. You keep your health at a maximum, or do you risk have low health in order to get more points?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>You aim with the mouse and shoots by left clicking.<br/>You move with the WASD keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra info:</strong><br/>Please play the game in 16:9 radios.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f048f2af01cac7c6f11c407eb4d316c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Levi Moore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
