Please don't dislike as I said, this is a VERY old version that is just a test. You can kick around crates, jump off the map, or do a tiny little parkour. To exit hold windows key and press tab, then hit the little X. Gun doesn't work if you're wondering. If You have any ideas feel free to let me know! Beta 0.2 out. Very little gameplay, you can get on the roof of the tall buildings. </p>\n<p>Specs: Windows 7 to Latest version, 1gb ram, any kind of graphics, basically the worst computer ever can run this.</p>\n<p>ONLY WINDOWS CAN RUN THIS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42343a3d390b513506bc955458a3be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Build Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
