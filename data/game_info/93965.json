These have revealed details of an intergalactic threat from a race that call themselves the Cygma Elite. An EDF strike team was immediately mobilised and sent to explore the planet to find out more about the alien threat. The team discovered that the Cygma Elite have built a series of weapons factories that are producing nuclear pods. These deadly pods have been stored in a huge 32 level facility known as the TRANCE SECTOR.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tReports from our team indicate that the Cygma Elite are planning to use the hundreds of pods stored within the TRANCE SECTOR to create an Armageddon Bomb - a devastating device that poses a threat not only to Earth, but our entire Solar System!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYour mission: Enter the TRANCE SECTOR and disable the nuclear pods on each of the 32 levels, causing a cascade reaction that will destroy the facility and the Cygma Elite homeworld - before they destroy US!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis special version of TRANCE SECTOR is a collaborative project between \r\n\tThe New Dimension, RGCD, Psytronik and Kiken Corporation.
