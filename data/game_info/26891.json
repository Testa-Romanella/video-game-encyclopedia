Every \n      error will be mercilessly penalized and the chance to create a new world \n      record will vanish away in the London fog.\n    </p><p>\n      10 games in one: 100 meters sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 \n      meters run, 110 meters hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, \n      and finally the exhausting 1500 meters run.\n    </p><p>\n      In each discipline you control your athlete simply with the stylus, but \n      you won\u2019t succeed without proper timing, speed, and managing your \n      stamina. Results achieved in individual disciplines are stored in a \n      table and compared with the best world scores. The total score in the \n      decathlon is calculated using a real-world formula, thus it is possible \n      to accurately compare your score not only to the world record but also \n      to the other athletes participating in the competition, including up to \n      three friends with whom you take turns during the game.\n    </p><p>\n      Enjoy a stylish design which naturally complements the great playability \n      of original sports games.

When \n      jumping, you have to attain the necessary speed and time your take-off \n      correctly, and when throwing you won\u2019t succeed without totally \n      concentrating on your technique.\n    </p><p>\n      Only one athlete will get the gold medal for his country.\n    </p><p>\n      Features\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 10 disciplines, a training mode, and a competition for the gold medal<br/>\u2022 \n      A visual assistant for easier training in the disciplines<br/>\u2022 Accurate \n      control using the stylus<br/>\u2022 A selection of 32 national representations<br/>\u2022 \n      Game for 1 to 4 players<br/>\u2022 A world records table<br/>\u2022 A stylish \n      design in the style of classic sporting games\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98b/98bbce1ae9278cbf963a2b0bef40bf48.jpg", "website": "http://decathlon2012.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Cinemax"], "esrb_rating": null}
