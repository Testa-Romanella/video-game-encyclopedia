And more. Because, in this multiple-character role-playing game, you don't read about the adventure \u2014 you live it!<br/><br/>You create a special force of eight star-troopers by selecting characters with different levels of strength, speed, courage, intelligence, psychic power and other skills.<br/><br/>Your first mission: Locate the infamous Blackbeard and destroy his band of intergalactic pirates \u2014 a monumental task given the thousands of planets that make up this game universe. With guidance from Armed Forces Headquarters, you'll search planets and explore dungeon-like hideouts for clues to Blackbeard's home base. Along the way, you'll battle his minions in hand-to-hand and ship-to-ship combat.<br/><br/>With each successful foray, your crew will gain fighting experience, rise in rank and carry more powerful weapons such as ion guns, bacterial-infestation grenades and thunderbolt rifles.<br/><br/>Upon completion of your first task (should you survive it at all!), you'll battle more than smugglers \u2014 you'll take on an entire alien, insectoid race! Your orders: Uncover enemy invasion plans and use them to destroy the insect's main battleships.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T07:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/0355f76ddefae9a6598be1c4c9cb47bb.jpeg", "website": "http://www.starcommandgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Strategic Simulations", "Doug Wood", "Star Command", "Warballoon Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SNEG", "Star Command", "Warballoon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
