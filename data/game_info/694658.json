In the garage: point and click on parts of the taxi to upgrade them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T04:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8b/b8b87d16a694a94a020861a4e57aec98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oliverlam2"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
