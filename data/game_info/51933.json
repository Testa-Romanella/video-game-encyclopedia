{"id": 51933, "slug": "dungeon-duos", "name": "Dungeon Duos", "name_original": "Dungeon Duos", "description": "<strong>Dungeon Duos</strong> is inspired by a puzzle runner mini-game of the same name. I took the idea and  evolved it from 1 puzzle to over 300. You and one partner work together to finish the puzzles and race to the end. Jump over lava, solve puzzles, destroy obstacles, and sabotage your opponents. <br/><br/>While playing unlock hundreds of customization options from hats and hair styles, to wings and torches.Features<strong>Hand Crafted Levels</strong> - There are over 300 puzzles, and while they are randomly chosen when play, they are <strong>not</strong> randomly made. I worked on every last one to make sure it would look beautiful, perform great, and offer loads of entertainment. <br/><br/><strong>Offline 2-4 Players </strong>- Take the game offline to the full extent. Play with your friends on the couch with up to 4 controllers. (2 Players can use the Keyboard if needed. Though, not the most comfortable experience.)<br/><br/><strong>Online 1-2 Split-Screen</strong> - Play with up to 3 friends, 1 can even be on the same computer as you with online split-screen. While on split-screen, player 2 will still get full customizing options.<br/><br/><strong>Constant Updates</strong> - I plan on updating the game for awhile. Adding Puzzles, Game Modes, Music, Ect. (And of course, tweaking the online experience and removing any bugs.)<br/><br/><strong>Quick Matching</strong> - Don't have a lot of time? The average game length is 3 minutes. Too Short? Bump it up from 10 puzzles to 25, or 50, or even 100.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bfc809dd9ace23cbdb3a009febae6e7.jpg", "website": "http://www.earthcakestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["EarthCake Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EarthCake Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
