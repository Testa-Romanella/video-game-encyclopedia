I am a one man developer and that means I have to do everything in this company in order to make a fun game. Being an indie developer has a huge downside and that\u2019s recognition, financial stability and the lack of a game developing team. I continue to make games but it\u2019s becoming a real struggle to make this into a living. I do this because I love to make games and to see players reacting to the games that I make. I would be so appreciative of you if you were to buy the game. It lets me know that you want to see an indie developer succeed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T06:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd799a9d302a2ae80024d81ac5f1f4e7.jpg", "website": "https://www.yobobgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yobob"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Y.B."], "esrb_rating": null}
