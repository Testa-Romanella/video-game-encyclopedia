If you, however, touch a bird that is not on the next in the order, you will lose all the birds you're carrying. You'll have to choose between getting the birds faster with a higher risk, or be slow and possibly losing the level because of the time counter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c351462e92effdd2ef85d4250f13f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chinobistar", "BradEich"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
