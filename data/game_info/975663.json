Sweeper", "description": "<h3>Game Description</h3><br/><strong>\"Avoid the mines, find all the treasures, and clear the stage!\"</strong><br/><br/>The primary goal of traditional minesweeper is to locate all the mines on the stage.<br/>This involves distinguishing tiles with mines from those without, and game completion is achieved upon identifying all mine locations.<br/><br/>However, this game's objective is not to find mines.<br/>It's about avoiding mines to discover treasures, and the game is cleared when all treasures are found.<br/><br/>Even if you can discern which tiles are not empty, you cannot know whether they are treasure tiles or mine tiles.<br/><br/>Therefore, you can:<br/><br/>Use items to identify the nature of a tile, or<br/>Deduce from the surrounding numbers of mines and treasures, or<br/>Guess based on the current number of remaining mines and traps, or<br/>Just take a wild guess,<br/>to determine whether a tile is a treasure or a mine.<h3>A large-scale tomb raiding game mode with multiple stages forming one dungeon</h3><br/>In each stage, finding all treasures lets you acquire one piece of equipment.<br/>With each piece of equipment aiding in clearing stages, complete all stages to find the final treasure and clear the dungeon!<h3>A small-scale tomb raiding game mode focusing on clearing a single stage</h3><br/>This game mode involves solving a single stage using deduction alone.<h3>Controller Support</h3>No device other than a mouse is needed to play the game! In fact, using a controller other than a mouse for minesweeper feels awkward.<br/>(Gamepads are not supported.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T07:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1dbabb3d1ab829add7b9dbae185242b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KMG"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KMG"], "esrb_rating": null}
