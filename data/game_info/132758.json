At each step, the tile behind you disappears. The player to get stuck without moves first, loses.</p>\n<p>There is also a tutorial in the game with the tile and power up types.</p>\n<p>There is also a very simple AI adversary in the game, if you don't have someone else to play with you.</p>\n<p>You can move the camera with AWSD or by touching the screen sides.</p><p>Ludum dare page:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/leave-me-alone</p>\n<p>Ps.: We could't test the Mac and Linux versions!
