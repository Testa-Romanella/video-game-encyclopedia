But the Bird people are not very fond of you at the start and you will have to gain reputation to get access to more districts in the city. Therefore, helping citizens of Haven by completing quests will be an important part of the game.

The main city Haven with its surrounding lands, the mountains in the east of the cave, the desert in the west and the old woods in the south. The Fish people could not settle on their own land. They lived by a river between two nations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At that time, the legend of the five elemental dungeons led a small group of adventurers to find the Main Core, in which all elements are united. With this power, Haven was raised into the clouds and the crater it left, filled with water. In the newly created sea beneath the city, the Fish people found their own region and equality between the nations was finally established. A time of peace and friendship began.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But after centuries of harmony, the Bird people in Haven began to look down on the nations below. Their false sense of superiority, furthered by advancements in research and sciences, spread hatred and inequality, resulting in the oppression and enslavement of the other races. After decades of tyranny, a resistance formed and has attacked the Birds in Haven multiple times.<br/><br/>One of these rebels is a young woman called Fynn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:54:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64931ff07c52e25f8e7a4882c54980b.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/blackcave_ent", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 534, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Cave Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Black Cave Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
