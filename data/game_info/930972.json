{"id": 930972, "slug": "panorama-prologue", "name": "Pan'orama: Prologue", "name_original": "Pan'orama: Prologue", "description": "<strong>Pan\u2019orama is a tile-placing puzzle game of creating beautiful, mellow landscapes, that calms your mind and lets your imagination run free.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Pan\u2019orama, your goal is to score as many points as possible by connecting pieces of land with each other to create a larger environment. You gather points by placing the colorful tiles to create ever-evolving biomes, placing structures and completing quests, which require you to think ahead and plan accordingly. <br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><h3>Sculpt your own world</h3>Freedom to create is what drives Pan\u2019orama\u2019s gameplay. Shape your own little world out of fields, forests, meadows and structures. Place tiles of the same kind next to each other to transform the terrain into breathtaking vistas!<br/><h3>Complete quests and earn rewards</h3>Quests of different shapes and sizes will often pop up, requiring you to place specific tiles in specific places. Placing them in the perfect spot and fulfilling their conditions will net you extra points, as all of your previously placed tiles count towards the quest goals.  You\u2019ll have to think tactically to get the most out of them!<br/><h3>Discover and build structures</h3>Well placed tiles will get you points, and after reaching a certain threshold, you\u2019ll be able to pick one of 3 boosters with structures. These will grant you extra tiles and a structure with a special power (to get even more points!). There are 48 structures in total and once you build them all, you get to place an epic Monument!<br/><h3>Free your imagination</h3>Being creative and letting your imagination take over is what\u2019s at the core of the game. Sculpt epic mountain ranges, fill lakes and meadows with water, create picturesque towns surrounded by plains and forests. In Pan\u2019orama, nothing stops you from using your imagination to its fullest!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-14T20:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f728231b72954cad198ffb8156e833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 44, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chicken Launcher"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
