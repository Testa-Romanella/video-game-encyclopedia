{"id": 825364, "slug": "senpaio", "name": "Senpa.io", "name_original": "Senpa.io", "description": "This is a cross platform multiplayer online action game.<br/>You start the game as a tiny bacteria (cell) in a petri dish. You must try to survive by avoiding attacks by bigger players. At the same time, you eat food and become a bigger and bigger cell, until you are large enough to eat other players.<br/><br/>The game is very immersive and has very active gameplay with a lot of action. All your enemies are real people, so you must find a good strategy to become the biggest cell on the gamefield! Anyone can become big in one moment, or lose all their progress in the next - so be careful :) Game mechanics are similar to other .io games which you probably already know - but this is not agar or diep!<br/><br/>This game was made by the same developers of Agar.io and is constantly updating with new and unique features!<br/><br/>Warning! This game is very addictive and takes alot of effort from you to survive with so much action.<br/>So if you die in the beginning, be patient, and improve your skills :)<h3>How to Play Senpa.io</h3>Senpa.io is simple to play, you simple use your mouse cursor to navigate around the screen, and you use space to split your cell, and W to eject mass. You also have a hotkey menu and you can create many custom controls!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T04:07:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c100ff3cc4f3896d3628564b402a22e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VexxusArts"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Miniclip.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
