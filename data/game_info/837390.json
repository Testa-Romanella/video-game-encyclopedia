Otherwise you can  find all comics at matchmakercomic.com! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>This volume contains a special guest comic by my friend Raine (@juicysnoops online!) and it's really great!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Another note, is that as of this volume you can also get it by subscribing to me on Patreon. You could technically get them all by subscribing for one month, but if you don't want to pay monthly I kindly ask that you buy here instead, as these comics are free and the support I get is a huge help!<br/></p>\n<p>I've included a cbz with altered colours/textures that will read much    better on ereaders. I know there's a limited audience for that, but    since that audience would include me I threw it in just in case!       </p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for your support!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/32885e747368ca8a24978d4f5788a736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cam marshall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
