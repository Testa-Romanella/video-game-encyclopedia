Wield a razor-sharp sword alongside a mighty gun, and make mincemeat of your foes before blasting away his buddies. Effortlessly dodge through return fire and lop off heads one by one. Or just simply cleave through a crowd in one single dash and swipe.</p>\n<p>Gameplay rewards thinking fast and acting faster, with enhanced movement systems (Dodges! Rocket jumping!) and your overall effectiveness based entirely on how many enemies you can plow through in a row with minimal damage to yourself. Kill fast and hard, and you&#39;ll be rewarded with a slew of special moves and a bunch of damage...hang from a distance and timidly plink at them bit by bit until they die, and you&#39;ll be ill-suited for the challenges ahead</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T14:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a173fc389646742aefb877a2c5829de9.jpg", "website": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/demonsteele", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
