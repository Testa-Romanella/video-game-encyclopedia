Conway. However, our evolving cells are now quantum bits and the rules defining the evolution of each cell are decided by a real quantum computer.</p>\n<p>The player decides which initial cells to activate initially in the Quantum Tree of Life and will then have to predict how Life will spread, flourish or disappear in the Tree.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:29:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9eb5d3f77111c4f58a81699a1b7698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bosoko", "Sonya_mi", "va-wizard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
