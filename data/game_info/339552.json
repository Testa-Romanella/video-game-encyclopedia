{"id": 339552, "slug": "overload-hazard", "name": "Overload Hazard", "name_original": "Overload Hazard", "description": "<p>Overload Hazard is an Action Platformer heavily inspired by Megaman X.<br/>You can dash, you can wall jump and you can charge your shot, but the main mechanic of this game is the \"Overload\". By dealing damage to enemies to build up your Overload and when it's eventually full, you can activate it to acquire some powerups such as increased dash speed, increased bullet speed and knockback nullification.<br/><br/>This game is still a big work in progress, and currently it's only a demo of what I consider a very small part of the game. But please, enjoy! and give feedback on any aspect that you can!<br/><br/>You can play with mouse and keyboard or you can play with a gamepad, and it is strongly recommended to use a gamepad, since the experience is much smoother and more like a classic Megaman X game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c68407856780ecd1c9cdf0cd38000f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daikenki"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
