There are currently 5 levels, which are all the same size, but with a different amount of obstacles. Overall, the game should not take you too long to finish, but it is still challenging.\u00a0<br/><br/>I made this game for Ludum Dare,\u00a0 it is a game jam where you have 72 hours to make a full game. I did not have enough time to add in everything I\u00a0wanted, but most of the important features are there. This is my first full game so do not expect it to be perfect, I know that there are probably many glitches left in the game and I didn't have enough time to fix them all.<br/><br/>I am going to be uploading a video to my youtube channel about how the game was created, and my process of completing the game jam here:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzM-LkhfSlKwSY6WY0LJLMA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:12:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d3e59e2500e3bec02c4ff68173e38b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanielBerec"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
