Everything was made completely by me in the given time\u00a0except for audio which I obtained from the Wowie Asset Pack.</p>\n<p>Thank\u00a0You to Brackeys for hosting this amazing Jam.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Your Goal in the game is to move both the white and black players to their colored portals. The problem is, there are boxes blocking the way to the portals, and White and Black are not strong enough to move them. So to be become<strong> stronger </strong>the two players must fuse <strong>together </strong>and make a new player, Grey. Grey is strong enough to move boxes around so that once un fused, Black and White can make it to their portals.</p>\n<p>Complete 5 simple puzzles to win the entire game.</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n<p>AWD keys = Black Player Movement.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys = White Player Movement.</p>\n<p>E key = Fuse players to become Grey.</p>\n<p>F key = Un fuse players to become White and Black.</p>\n<p>AWD keys = Grey Player Movement.</p>\n<p>R key = Restart level.</p>\r\nTake Note:\r\n<p>Boxes or Players may suddenly stop moving. To keep moving, move in the other direction and then move in the direction you want to go.</p>\n<p>Game can be played with 2 people if you so wish. (1 player controls White and the other controls Black, decide who controls Grey, when fused)</p>\n<p>Olny 5 levels although I would have made more if I had more time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f572fb148ab0ad59127bea6ffdf7c59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["MigDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
