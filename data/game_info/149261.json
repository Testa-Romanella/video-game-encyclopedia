Blood. And Running. Can you balance the slowdown of attacking fellow racers with the boost their blood gives you?!? CAN YOU?! <br/><br/>Chase your fellow racers: As you run, your blood energy will decrease, forcing you to FEED ON YOUR FELLOW RUNNERS. Run up to them and press Space -- after feeding, sprint on, young vampire, sprint on. <br/><br/>Only one (long) question remains: Can YOU balance your blood levels, speed boosts, hunger, and feeding slowdowns well enough to win? Well, can you? <br/><br/><br/>Arrows to run, Space to attack (close range).</p><p>**</p><p>8/25 - Updated to work in Firefox. Hrm.
