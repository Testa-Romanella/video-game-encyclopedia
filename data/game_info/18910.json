Along the journey you come across different encounters with different outcomes depending on your decision. You can either try a passive approach if you're feeling peaceful, you can try to contact or trade with whatever oddity you've crossed paths with or you can go full offensive and fire a missile to try and steal their power! <br/><br/>\u200bOESE is about decisions and consequences.Features<ul><li>Over 100 different encounters with different outcomes. <br/></li><li>7 races and 4 factions that will love you and aid you on your way. <br/></li><li>7 races and 4 factions that will hate you and send bounty hunters out to kill you. <br/></li><li>20 in game achievements<br/></li><li>Delicious pixel art and original soundtrack.<br/></li><li>Customizable ship so you can look nice. <br/></li><li>The omnipresent impending doom of the indestructible Nox Cubes.<br/></li><li>A friendly companion to keep you company.</li></ul><br/>The game is very relaxing and turn-based, allowing you to take your time and enjoy the journey of space (or panic if your power is running low.)
