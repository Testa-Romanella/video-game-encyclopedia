As we're often told, drinking water is important to keep our bodies healthy. This short prototype was developed in response to the fact that at least 70% of the UK's population are de-hydrated.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The game is played with the mouse, you can set a goal for the amount of water you drink and once you complete it a fish is added to your tank (note: this only happens once in the prototype! If you want to see it spawn again you have to close and reopen the game completely)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can also feed your fish by clicking the button at the bottom of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All art and assets are made by me @ Ashleigh Kennedy\u00a0</p>\n<p>Background Music is from here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/Captain_Glouglous_Incredible_Week_...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think of this prototype!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fd82cf9f825d56927858ca127b5da43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alturkabuterimon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
