{"id": 825820, "slug": "paintbrush-vs-pencil", "name": "Paintbrush Vs Pencil", "name_original": "Paintbrush Vs Pencil", "description": "<p>A platformer game with a puzzle aspect where the player must figure out how to traverse each room without touching the second player or the incorrect colour! A simple game made for the Colours 2022 game jam! This is more of a demo game than a full game. There's 4 levels though one is a tutorial one. As this was made within 3 days there might be a few bugs but I hope people enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Paintbrush: WASD to move</p>\n<p>Pencil: Does the opposite of whatever paintbrush does!</p>\n<p>Colour avoidance: At the top of the screen for each level a colour will be shown. If either player character touches the colour then both die and the level resets!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T08:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91f66f872f583f4a4528c89da24e6258.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chloe24603"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
