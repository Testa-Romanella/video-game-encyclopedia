I didn't get my pause screen and the music doesn't loop perfectly, but for a first project, I'm pretty proud.</p><p>Please do leave me feedback, it really would help me improve! This is the most fun I've had in a while and I'd love to get better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94e/94ec7daf619fba81ddb1a9e83abbb3f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheAirHideous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
