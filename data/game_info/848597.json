This is a very short, perhaps 20 minutes or less game to link Ephmerium: Unreality to the next chapter I am working on; \"Ephemerium: Doors of Yesterday\".\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note: Successfully win the challenge in this short game for a secret ending.</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is a FAN game, and thus is a free project. Any donations you provide will be put towards the sequel \"<strong>Ephemerium: Doors of Yesterday</strong>\"\u00a0and my continued quest to master the Unreal Engine.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Notes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Extract the files and open the file name \"Ephemerium - Interlude\" to begin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To help those who are interested in clearing the challenge, Ironmouse starts with 200% health and infinite mana\u00a0as opposed to her normal 100% and 150% respectively. To balance out the mana, you can now be interrupted while healing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unlike the final boss of Unreality, this boss is <strong>almost\u00a0</strong><strong>immune to melee damage and cannot be staggered from melee attacks.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Introduction movie skips if you've already been defeated once. You can watch the intro by resetting progress in the title screen.<br/></p>\n<p>Characters and Achaemenid ruins components modeled by\u00a0Phynra.\r\n</p>\n<p>Background and box art by\u00a0Maitsuarts.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Boss character designed by\u00a0Astaroth_h.\r\n</p><p>Music by Will\u00a0o Wisp productions</p>\n<p>Control changes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- You no longer need to hold space to enter a combat stance to attack; press F or left click to attack and R to heal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Mousey is no longer invincible during healing and can be interrupted</p>\n<p>- There is a restart option in the pause menu so you don't have to play through the entire expansion just to get another chance at clearing the challenge.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Known bug:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes after the initial boss fight, you might spawn out of bounds in Private Quarters. Restarting the game (close then reopen)\u00a0should fix this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes Mousey may stop attacking. Press attack, wait for a moment and that should fix it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please report any bugs or issues you find so that I may fix them. This is the most complex AI I've ever attempted to make, so I do expect quite a few reports.\u00a0</strong></p><p>Version 1.01:</p><p>Fixed an issue where level music continued to play into cutscenes (I hope!)\u00a0</p><p>Version 1.02:\u00a0</p><p>Definitely fixed the issue now. If you still encounter the issue with level music and ambient sound not cutting out during cutscenes, please let me know.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e8345e66ae01daaea19e76364b1e4e2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moose"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
