But for a group of young students from a local school, it was the perfect place for an exciting adventure.  They planned to spend the night in the forest, and to make the experience even more exciting, they decided to summon a demon using an ancient ritual found in the school's library.  At first, it all seemed fun and exciting. They lit candles, traced symbols on the ground, and recited the words of the ritual. But when they finished, something changed in the atmosphere of the forest.  The wind stopped blowing, the trees grew darker, and the forest animals stopped making noise. The students began to feel a strange and frightening presence around them.  Suddenly, something moved in the dark and they heard a roar that made their hearts race. They tried to flee, but realized that they were surrounded by a dense fog that prevented them from seeing their way back.  As they tried to find a safe path, the students realized that the demon they had summoned was behind them, following in their footsteps. They heard their demonic screams and laughter echoing through the forest as they tried to find a way to protect themselves.  The demon hunted them all night, torturing them with horrifying visions and creating illusions to confuse their minds. A pastor was sent to the place to find out what happened to the teenagers and eliminate the evil entity.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65bcd7d8fd2d3dc8b623598d52abf9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["King Mirage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
