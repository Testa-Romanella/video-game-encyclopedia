Players act as merchants and thieves who steal each other's goods in a chaotic marketplace.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Choose which thieving vendor to play, and try to be the one with the most coins at the end of the game!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>You have to collect resources that appear periodically in the center of the market, carry them to your shop and sell them to the customers.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>But beware! All the while, the other players can directly steal the stuff you stored in your shop, so keep their paws off your goods!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Have fun, play fair (or don't), and may the best of you thieves win!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T02:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c8ad04b0d6b0f38e326a316ff204d64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thief Shop Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rubika Supinfogame"], "esrb_rating": null}
