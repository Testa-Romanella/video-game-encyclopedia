It's a world where things make sense and add up, but still with a splash of risk and challenge. Most problems have an underlying cause \u2014 literally. Underneath the visible is a hidden pattern that can be fit together, illuminated, and brought forth into the visible with a burst of color.</p>\n<p>The characters in Beauty in the Grid are artists, psychics, and logicians of a particular kind. They find hidden patterns in the world and bring them to life. Sometimes the only goal is to simply add beauty to the world and sometimes it's to create the missing piece to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>This download is a spreadsheet meant to be played by sharing between several players with editing abilities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:00:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f9728df655f8dbe9f7fc6353c3d3673d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whimsy Machine"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
