Also defeated enemies gives you 100 \"Soulthings\" which is a super original term for your currency (will change name later).\u00a0<strong>Update 3/2/2021\u00a0</strong>Added basic health bar over enemies' head (will add damage number when taking damage soon).\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 4/2/2021\u00a0</strong>Added health and stamina bar to player, as well as disappearing health bar for enemies. Added additional effect to enemy shooting ranged attack as an indication for the player.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 9/2/2021\u00a0</strong>Added a new enemy type, tweaked some animations and effects and materials.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 22/2/2021\u00a0</strong>It's a bit confusing to update 2 different itch links but hopefully soon we'll combine them into one so it'll all make sense.\r\n<strong>Update 23/2/21\u00a0</strong>Added some additional assets in the tutorial area. The overgrown foliage stands in front of the player and it needs to be cut before the player can progress.\r\nThere were multiple improvements to the stamina system as well\u00a0(mostly bugfixes) and now the player can actually move while blocking with a reduced speed which gives the player more flexibility in battle.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 25/2/21\u00a0</strong>We have introduced a system that hides objects that would obscure the player to make it easier to navigate around.\r\nAdditionally a new area have been added to the end of the level which will be the gate that leads to the lift that takes the player into the mountain. This area features a dart trap that is meant to teach the player how to use roll and block (oh yeah, roll actually gives you some invincibility\u00a0 frames so that helps).\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 4/3/21\u00a0</strong>\u00a0So quite a lot has changed since the last update. The system that hides objects in the player's view has been reworked so now it hides a separate top portion of the meshes depending on specific areas the players are.\r\nMore assets such as destroyable crates, barrels(with some spicy particle effects), tree and bush variants has been added.\r\nThe lift area has been populated with some fairly detailed assets and the lift itself.\r\nAs this area is meant to serve as a tutorial area, we have popup messages along the road to indicate what skill the player should use at certain points. UI-wise it is still an early version of course.\r\nOverall we think we are getting close to finishing up this area so we can move onto other areas and the boss fight segment.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 7/3/21\u00a0</strong>Finally added a pause menu (Escape key)\u00a0which is only used to access a debug teleport menu for now, there is also an exit button which might not work in webGL but it should be fine when it is played as an exe.\r\nWe have started working on the transition part between scenes. This includes setting certain objects such as the player to DoNotDestroyOnLoad which preserves stats such as HP,\u00a0 stamina, souls and later on upgrades.\r\nIt is possible to travel to the next scene now but it only really contains a bumpy lift ride and a flat plane with some funky stairs(ofc this will be another built out environment).\r\n<strong>Update 9/3/21\u00a0</strong>So the last implementation of scene loading and retaining valuables turned out to be a hot mess after all... So we have put our heads together and found a better and simpler way of doing it using PlayerPref which is built into unity. So right now if you die in a certain scene, you *should* restart in the scene you died with with half of\u00a0 your souls and max HP while your current HP and souls carry over completely to the second scene after you activate the lever. After some testing it seems like this feature works on WebGL as well (we think it's using some sort of cookie in your browser) to store the \"save file\". So you can literally close the window, reopen it and you continue with how many souls you left off with.\r\nThe second area has been updated with some new assets and a more expressive lift crash (to explain why you cant go back)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 11/3/21\u00a0</strong>We have finally figured out how to detect keyboard and controller input during runtime so the tutorial popups actually change according to input. Feel free to try to play\u00a0with controllers if it is possible.\u00a0\r\nThe Descent area has been extended with a \"hidden\" tunnel leading to what it is going to be our hub house\u00a0with the NPC for upgrades.\r\n<strong>Update 24/3/21\u00a0</strong>The \"new\" safe house has been added and furnished compared to the last update. The glowing capsule upstairs is a placeholder for the Vendor/Upgrade NPC for later on.\r\nMost of the time (the last 8 days) were taken up by the boss who is mostly functional, however the arena is still just a placeholder of course. You can get to it by using the teleport cubes in the second area (placeholder until we implement rest/save spots).\u00a0Some additional animations such as\u00a0 stagger (when you cut her legs off...oh yeah you can do that!), and the intro animation still need to be added. It will also have multiple phases when it alternates between hanging from the ceiling (spitting ranged attacks) while smaller spiders are summoned. So basically the boss works, you can kill it but it's pretty hard as the player's stats are the starter stats as we do not have an upgrade system. We are still trying to figure out the best way to handle healing but a healing item will be a part of this of course (no wonder it's hard to beat the boss without it lol)\r\n<strong>Update 25/3/21\u00a0</strong>Minor update relating to the boss, it has the phases in-between the land phases now (30 secs of doing nothing for now) , this is when the spiderlings (Smaller Spiders)\u00a0\u00a0would be invading the player and in the second one (bellow 33%) is when the boss would also do a spit attack from above along with the spiderlings.\r\nAlso the arena has been updated to an alpha level. Obviously it needs a lot of detail but this might be the size we are going for.\u00a0\r\n<strong>Update 27/3/21</strong>\u00a0The lever object at the lift has been upgraded to a more fancy version so it stands out a bit more.\r\nThe lighting has been change a little in the descent area before and inside the safehouse (it should make more of a difference in terms of performance rather than looks)\r\nThe boss has gained a new ability in her ceiling phases (at 66% and 33%). It has a spit attack that leaves a patch on the floor that does tick damage. The additional smaller spiders still needs to be added. Also the boss will now stagger(get stunned for a couple of seconds) when one of its' legs gets chopped off (if you target a specific legs it is not too hard to do atm) which gives a quite big window to deal some serious damage.\r\nIn terms of feedback for the player, we are planning to implement the red vignette effect when the player takes damage and there should be some ui flashing on the stamina bar as well for when the player is trying to use an ability that costs more stamina than what's available.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1/4/21\u00a0</strong>The boss is pretty much finished on a practical level, we have created the small spiderlings that will be also used in another area, they have a ranged attack that slows the player down for a couple of seconds. They spawn in the phases of the boss when its on the ceiling. The boss also does a ranged area of effect attack in the second ceiling phase. To trigger the bossfight the player needs to walk up to the object in the middle of the arena (a cube for now, it will be changed) and press interact (Button E on keyboard or A/X on controller but there is a prompt for the keyboard one atm) to begin the encounter. You can use the teleport cube on the lift to get to the boss area after death.\r\nThe player can heal now as well but the UI is very basic atm. The player has 5 charges of 50HP heal (your max hp is 100) so it should help out quite alot if you want to actually kill the boss.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 12/4/21\u00a0<br/></strong>Because of size limitations with itch , the tutorial section is no longer available under this link. You can access the tutorial area to practice under the following link:\u00a0<br/>https://viktorsitkei.itch.io/thedescent</p>\n<p>Under this link, the tutorial is not present, the player starts from the end of the tutorial.</p>\n<p>The Boss area along with the encounter and various other areas has been upgraded with some extra details (see YouTube link for a playthrough with the previous version).\r\nWe have started a new area which is a traveller's town inside the mountain which will house most of the player progression before the boss. this area will have an additional mini-boss.\r\nThe player now have armour, it does not do anything but it's prettier.\r\nThe Safe house's Vendor NPC now has a model (does not have interaction yet)\r\nRest points has been introduced that saves your last location and restores HP to full but also respawns all enemies. (There is one at the lift, one at the safe house and one after the boss)\r\n</p>\n<p>Various bugs and annoying glitches has been fixed such as:\r\n-The player can not force itself through corners like it used to be able to therefore skipping segments of the level should not be possible.\r\n-The HP and Stamina Bar resizes with the window size so no matter how small the window someone is playing the game in it should be visible.\r\n-When first starting the game it should not display the \"You Died\" screen, needing you to press Space to restart.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Update 14/4/21\u00a0</strong> Added detailed houses and built out most of the town. There is a temple which will have an elevator in it that serves as a shortcut down to the mines right next to the boss's chamber(Makes running back to the boss much easier if you die, of course for now you can use the teleport cubes).<br/>-Fixed but when player starts to hover above the crashed lift at the start.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 28/4/21\u00a0</strong> The temple with the elevator has been added and once it's unlocked from the mine side it can be used as a shortcut to the boss. This unlock is also saved so the shortcut is saved between play sessions just like your souls currency and last checkpoint.\u00a0Some enemies appearances\u00a0 and animations have changed to telegraph actions better, however there is still improvements to be made in this field. The UI of the enemies have been updated to show the recent damage the player has dealt to them \"soulslike\" style and the player's UI had a smaller update, however this is still not final.\u00a0<br/>An adaptive camera FOW has been added to the boss fight which basically zooms out so you can see more. this system can be used later to tailor the FOW to certain scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Update 30/4/21\u00a0</strong> Finally added a dialogue system that is quite flexible in a way that the amount of dialogues and the text can be just edited from the inspector. This can be tested with the NPC in the safe house after the initial section after the lift.\u00a0<br/>Using this dialogue system a \"Gate is locked from this side\" message has been added to one side of the gates. Some of the interact prompts has been fixed as well as they were rotated the wrong way.<br/>The \"souls\" currency counter has a new icon that is quite final. nothing special but it does the job. The UI has been mirrored so the status UI is on the top and the dialogue along with the boss HP is on the bottom. Some additional effects has been added for when the spiderlings hatch from the eggs down in the mines.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Update 7/5/21 </strong>The player's sword and shield has been updated (new model/texture), The shield's effect has changed so now it plays the effect when an attack is blocked. This way it is easier to see in advance and understand when you actually block an attack. Also blocking does not block in 360 degrees anymore, so that's fixed finally...<br/>A custom (fog)gate has been added to the boss's chamber with come cryptic warning above. All unlocked gates are now saved as player prefs so the progress is saved if you die.<br/>FINALLY the upgrade system has been implemented and it is accessible from the safe from the woman in the fancy robe upstairs in the\u00a0house where you end up after the lift crash. Navigating the upgrade screen also works with a controller so that's why one of the buttons are highlighted red even if you click on the other buttons with a mouse(this will be fixed later).<br/>The mine has been furnished a little more but it still needs some additional details.<br/><br/><strong>Update 9/5/21 </strong>Fixed various bugs and glitches and added some more details and functions:<br/><strong>-</strong>When the player dies they can no longer attack/roll etc until they press Space/X but rather there is a dip to black with the \"You died\" screen and it restarts from the last save spot with half the currency\u00a0(this may change so the player looses everything and has to go back to the point of death to retrieve the souls.<br/>-The player also cant attack/roll etc when talking to the upgrade NPC.<br/>-A new main menu screen has been added that is accessible by pressing escape or the \"option\" button on a controller. (Escape is quite annoying since on itch it takes you out of full-screen and then you have to press it again...may look into a workaround for this or otherwise we're open for suggestions for an alternative button on the keyboard)<br/>-Fixed a bug when the damage popup above the enemies head showed numbers like 24.9999...it should be all whole numbers now.<br/>-Added texture to the troop enemy (one with the hand cannons).<br/>-Added a damage vignette to indicate when the player takes damage. The intensity of the overlay increases depending on the amount of damage the player took.<br/>-Added a flashing texture to the stamina bar that blinks up when the player tries to perform an action that costs more stamina than what's available.<br/>-Also the tutorial section is once again available after some file size tinkering in the same itch link and it can be accessed from the main menu (escape) under \"Start tutorial\". The game starts with the main game regardless but this way the tutorial is available if someone wants to learn the controls beforehand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:47:56", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["viktorSitkei"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
