{"id": 9840, "slug": "we-happy-few", "name": "We Happy Few", "name_original": "We Happy Few", "description": "<p>We Happy Few is the tale of a plucky bunch of moderately terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful denial in the city of Wellington Wells. In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You\u2019ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don\u2019t take kindly to people who won\u2019t abide by their not-so-normal rules.<br />\nDiscover the retrofuturistic city\u2019s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren\u2019t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.<br />\nSave 15% when you pre-purchase We Happy Few, and get instant access to the game&#39;s alpha. This allows you to experience the introduction to Arthur&#39;s narrative, explore a portion of the procedurally generated world, collect and craft items, and choose how you\u2019ll interact with members of the Joy-obsessed society through stealth, combat, or conformity across a handful of the game\u2019s unique events.<br />\nPlus, get the exclusive in-game Jolly Brolly weapon at launch. There\u2019s a definite chance of pain when using this weaponized umbrella, complete with advanced blocking capabilities and trippy psychedelic interior.<br />\nRetrofuturistic 1960s England<br />\nSet in retrofuturistic 1960s England, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells, including its roads, its people, and its omnipresent television personality: Uncle Jack! But, it\u2019s actually a world on the brink of collapse. Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy.<br />\nThree Interwoven Narratives<br />\nPlay as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way.<br />\nA Dystopia of Your Very Own<br />\nIn We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you\u2019ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique.  Wellington Wells is never quite like you remember it.<br />\nTake Your Joy\u2026or Don\u2019t. The Choice is Yours<br />\nCustomize your We Happy Few experience:<br />\n\u2022   Choose from a range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike,<br />\n\u2022   Play through the story, or make your own story by customizing the sandbox,<br />\n\u2022   Masochistic? Try permadeath!,<br />\n\u2022   Collect recipes, scavenge items, and craft dozens of weapons, tools, and devices,<br />\n\u2022   Creep, crush, or conform your way through puzzles and encounters, and<br />\n\u2022   Fight with the crazy weapons you can craft, or fight with your bare hands and don\u2019t kill anyone!</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2018-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-13T22:53:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/537/537974990a025a3edcbe91e408e85fbc.jpg", "website": "http://compulsiongames.com/en/10/we-happy-few", "rating": 3.16, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 137, "owned": 1516, "beaten": 103, "toplay": 145, "dropped": 239, "playing": 35}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 309, "ratings_count": 350, "suggestions_count": 566, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 354, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Compulsion Games", "Gearbox Publishing"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Gearbox Publishing", "Compulsion Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
