{"id": 131398, "slug": "artful-bomber", "name": "Artful Bomber", "name_original": "Artful Bomber", "description": "<p>Artful Bomber is a retro-styled action game based around planning and punching. You take control of Milly, a demolitions expert hired by the International Police to arrest the owner of a dangerous robot factory. You are severely outnumbered, but with your wits, careful planning, and an extensive arsenal of explosive weapons, you can blow up dem robots!</p><p>I designed this game to be different from the standard action platformer - Artful Bomber is much more focused on planning and resource management. You can't just jump in and quickly take out all the robots. Your resources are limited and your punch animation is cumbersome. There are traditional gun-type weapons available, but you pay by the bullet, and bullets are expensive. Developing strategies with the trap weapons and methodically taking out the enemies will be your key to success. </p><p>KEY FEATURES:</p><p>Randomly-generated levels for endless replay value!</p><p>Lots of weapons to experiment with!</p><p>Save feature for maximum save scumming! (press R to restart the game)</p><p>Cute animal-type character!</p><p>Sweet jetpack styles for freedom of movement!</p><p>Missiles and rocket launchers and all that stuff!</p><p>Thank you very much for checking out the game! I really appreciate it.</p><p>-Dr. Kwack</p><p>(Iron Chancellor of Windmill Hill)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac38130c5d239c83b47460115a4fbbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WindmillHill"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
