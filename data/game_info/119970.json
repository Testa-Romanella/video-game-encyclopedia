Within that small farmhouse, a wacky, messy family and their housecat live their days in peaceful bliss.</p><p>The mouse that lives with them wishes it could say the same.</p>Trying to eat and live in a strange new place is already hard enough, but having to live with a natural enemy like the housecat is enough to stress out any mouse. To avoid causing a rift in the status quo of the residents of the house, the player assumes the role of this very stressed mouse and tries to prevent the sleeping housecat from waking up.
