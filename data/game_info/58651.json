TABG is a spin-off of its predecessor Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. According to developers, &quot;TABG - is 1st April joke we do every year&quot;.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is no different from other representatives of the genre: the players land on a piece of land that is surrounded by a certain cataclysm. The area of \u200b\u200bthe safe territory is continuously decreasing, and players must always move along and collect weapons, supplies and kill other players. The main task is to remain the last survivor. Thanks to the parody format, players have a much more extensive selection of weapons, for example, dual-wielding frying pans, and the animation of the characters&#39; movement is intentionally exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The first 100 hours after the release the game was available for free, but soon developers set $ 5 price tag. For developers, this is still a side project. All their focus goes to the main projects such as entirely Accurate Battle Simulator and Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T23:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c88/c88463dcf1b3fc79c54a59c30076344a.jpg", "website": "http://landfall.se", "rating": 2.81, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 210, "owned": 3318, "beaten": 47, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 320, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 423, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 424, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Landfall"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Landfall"], "esrb_rating": null}
