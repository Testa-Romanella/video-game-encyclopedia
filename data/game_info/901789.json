I want to minimize the paper, the books, the cards, whatever else.</p>\n<p>I also wanted something portable.</p>\n<p>These two sheets (printed front to back) offer a way to game with a small footprint. Use a phone dice roller, and it fits on plane tray, hotel desk, on the cover of a magazine at the doctor's office, in bed with a small lamp. <br/></p>\n<p>These sheets comprise of numerous tables to generate a game narrative, and to see it grow!</p>\n<p>There are monsters by terrain included! They are very simply statted, as a means of generating on the fly. HD could be d4, d6, or d8 if you are feeling punishing.</p>\n<p>There are encounters, oracles, settle creators, dungeon morphs. Loot tables, a list of bosses, dressing tables. It's all there!</p>\n<p>Also included is a 3-Stat character sheet, for running Cairn, Bastards. or other simplified version of old school games.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made possible as a free item by the support of the Perplexing Ruins Patreon!
