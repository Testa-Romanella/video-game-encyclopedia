My team and I hope you have as much fun playing it as we did making it. Our adventurous little Node is going to take you on a journey to a world of colors and delightful moments. This is a game made to help people reach their childish sides by playing with colors and painting all over the walls. It made for stress relief and comfort in the most relaxing ways. This game was based on a dream.\u00a0 Something during my worst moments. It was a playful little node full of colors playing and painting their beautiful little world. That\u2019s why this game is made to be dreamlike. We want players to feel like they\u2019re adventuring in a dream of their own design.</p>\n<p> <br/></p>\n<p>This was made for a project at Cal State Monterey Bay For Game Design 1.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE COLOUR.
