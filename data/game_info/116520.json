People say that 50 Cent is good but I do not think that he is as good as Eminem. </p><p>Eminem is very rude but also he is very funny, for example, in a music video he dressed up as robin from batman and robin and he looked very silly. I think Eminem is the best rapper ever <br/><br/>I wondered what if Eminem the good rapper was to rap with other rappers which are good and what they would sound like. This is what my game is. It is basically if Eminem was rapping with rappers like Macklemore and the Beastie Boys. <br/><br/>How to play: <br/>- press D, F, J, or K depeding on what the green circle is hovering over. <br/>- When the circle is red you can't rap yet. <br/>- Try to rap good. \r\n</p><p>(This was made for Ludum Dare 28 for the theme \"You Only Get One\") </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20dfce4e8d156154db4677e16b22c55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Afal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
