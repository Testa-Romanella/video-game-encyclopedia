The mythological pink beast hath risen from underneath  the quiet town of Blocksford-Upon-Dragon! You must build a stone  BARRICADE to protect the castle keep from a fiery fate, but beware the  Dragon\u2019s FIREBALLS! Use the fabled GREAT HAMMER to repair the castle  walls.\r\n</p>\n<p>The castle may be doomed, but you can buy your people some time to evacuate!\r\n</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n</p>\n<p>  ARROW KEYS - move   SPACE - pick up &amp; drop blocks / pick up &amp; SLAM hammer                   ARROW KEYS - move\r\n</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:\r\n</p>\n<p>  The dragon spits fireballs downfield in increasingly quick intervals. \r\n</p>\n<p>  Pick up piles of blocks from the rubble piles on either side of the screen using SPACE,  and place them in your field to    fortify your defenses.
