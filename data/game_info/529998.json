Here at Oddities &amp; Commodities you can sell a wide variety of different artifacts! These wacky unique artifacts vary in size and price.

While you send out henchmen on their adventures, it's your duty to barter and sell with the many customers that stop by your store. Be careful however, if you run out of money it's GAME OVER.
