The Hathorne House was originally constructed by Judge John Hathorne, inquisitor of the infamous Salem witch trials and the final home to 102-year-old Frances Tuttle, his last direct descendant. When Tuttle passed away, the estate became city property and while the mayor was seeking a manager to oversee the estate the home burst into flames. The ongoing investigation has turned up little evidence but concerned citizens have accused Mei Parry of arson and are pressuring the police to arrest the secretive teenager. As Nancy races to uncover the truth behind the arson, she discovers connections to the house\u2019s past with the Salem trials and finds herself drawn into a struggle with supernatural events that she simply can\u2019t explain. Nancy\u2019s convictions are put to the test. Are the ghosts real? Has Salem\u2019s dark history come to life, or is there someone else to blame? Time is short, and Nancy must find the answers before the clock strikes midnight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T23:21:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fe8/fe87583a828ff695f09d7fd3652b5a2c.jpg", "website": "https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/33-nancy-drew-midnight-in-salem/", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 16, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HeR Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["HeR Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
