You've got 60 seconds before the night is over and there are still plenty of presents to deliver! Drop them under the Christmas trees and make your way out through the chimney when you're done.</p>\n<p>First Person Santa was made in 7 days as a submission to 7dfps 2020 and PROCJAM 2020. It's a non-violent game about shooting presents at Christmas\u00a0trees.\u00a0The houses are generated procedurally; we've counted over 10,000 possible combinations of room layouts. It's our first game in C, written using SDL.\u00a0It uses a custom engine, and consequently doesn't support any audio nor text yet. We're working on it!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, please enjoy making pine trees grow by shooting presents at them and teleporting between houses through what appears to be an interdimensional wormhole connecting one fireplace to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse or arrow keys to look around.</li><li>WASD to walk.</li><li>Left mouse button or spacebar to shoot.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Release Notes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>There's no explicit timer yet, but you can observe the color of the sky to get a sense of when the night is over.</li><li>Currently there's no proper ending. You can play and visit houses for as long as you like.</li><li>Our deferred renderer doesn't support anti-aliasing.
