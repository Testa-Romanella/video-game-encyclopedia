But everytime you die, a new character will respawn that will do all the same actions you did in the previous round, this will keep building up and building up until eventually you have your own army!</p><p><strong>How is it related to the theme?</strong></p><p>This is related to the theme as you have to die (sacrifice yourself) in order to progress the game forward, sometimes the only option is to die in order to move forward... However you have to be careful, as you can only die a maximum amount of times.</p><p><strong>How to Play?</strong></p><p>All you have to do is use WASD to move, and point and click to shoot and everytime you die, a selection menu will open up, choose the Unit of your choice (if you have enough points to buy it), then continue playing and watch as the army expands! :O</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975f0452a15fe3f5aed4c1b0ab034f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["avenk2"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
