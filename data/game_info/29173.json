It takes place in the fictional Empire inspired by the XIX-century England. The plot picks up where Dishonored 2 left it. The game follows the adventures of the previous games&#39; villains: Billie Lurk, the captain of a sailing ship, and Daud, the assassin and the leader of The Whalers gang. They search for Outsider, an extradimensional creature from the world known as the Void who can give people supernatural abilities, and are going to kill him. Their story is intertwined with the larger events in the Empire, such as the reinstallment of the Empress, the faction rivalry and the Void influence on the world. The plot is non-linear and features multiple endings.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Billie Lurk from the first person view. Like its predecessors, Death of the Outsider emphasizes stealth and surprise attacks. Billie wields a dagger and eventually receives superhuman powers, such as teleportation and disguise. The expansion allows the unusually free use of these abilities. The player doesn&#39;t have to unlock them, they become available early at the game, and the energy they require regenerates automatically over time. Besides the main plot, the player can also accept side quests.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2017-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T02:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/742/74276457ebb9466e11d75a2be7722265.jpg", "website": "https://www.dishonored.com/", "rating": 4.05, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 370, "owned": 2463, "beaten": 525, "toplay": 220, "dropped": 58, "playing": 38}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 174, "ratings_count": 592, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 596, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "Arkane Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
