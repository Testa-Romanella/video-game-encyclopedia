You can play the game either with a keyboard or an xbox 360 controller. Other controllers may work, but you might have to\u00a0use\u00a0x360ce\u00a0to configure them as an xbox 360 controller.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u00a0am experiencing low framerates, what do I do?</strong>\u00a0First,\u00a0 go to the ingame video settings (\"Settings\" =&gt; \"Video\") and lower everything, especially the \"Details\" option. You can also lower the resolution (try to keep the same aspect ratio to eliminate black bars). If you're playing on a laptop, try switching the game to your computer's dedicated GPU. If the low framerates are sporadic, alt-tabbing when it happens\u00a0might solve the problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I play on Mac or Linux?</strong>\u00a0No. It only works on Windows for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f797c3acca8f4c3d909a7d597ed03448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Gervraud"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
