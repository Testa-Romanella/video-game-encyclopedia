In most runner games, the user directly controls the player character, but in order to stress the defenseless wolf aspect, the user controls the obstacles instead. There is a playable version of the game above, as well as a downloadable below for MacOS and Windows. Please feel free to leave constructive criticism in the comment section below.</p>\r\n*I can not test out whether or not the windows download works*", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8411bee8c26aed7eefbfa463210e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheBrain271"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
