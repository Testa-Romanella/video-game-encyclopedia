The theme of the Jam was \"Bright Future\" and supporting people in times of quarantine. The game itself at first sets the player in a city with, locked down in their houses, people. By collecting \"Bright Future\" or just Brights, you can proceed through the game, actually coming to the bright new future, after the quarantine - the windows in people's houses are dark, that means nobody is home. By collecting \"Dark Future\" you will be stuck on the level, without moving forward/on. By that I wanted to show the player that there will be a bright future, even if it doesn't seem so in the first place. We just need to try harder.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/14010d75a6484680bc11fe708e0b9282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
