We decided to make them in this time frame to help us keep the scale small and to allow us to get more practice when it comes to actually finishing our products.\u00a0The game is rough, but we are just starting so that's to be expected and there are plenty more on the way.\u00a0\u00a0All the assets were ones we found free online, other than that all the scripts were made by us.\u00a0 Feel more than free to comment or criticize the game, we need it to learn and get better. If you decided to play, thanks for your time.</p>\n<p>To play the game, aim the space man with the pointer then click the mouse to launch him. If you hit a missile head you have a few seconds to land on another missile otherwise you will die. Hitting the boss or launching off the screen will result in a game over as well. Survive until the boss health hits zero and you win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T04:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df25bd702295a2aa370a1dbf00584701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nomadic Monkey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
