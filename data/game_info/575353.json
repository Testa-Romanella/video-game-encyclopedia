Now a few years later we relaunch it with some improvements.\u00a0</p><p>Black Hole 3D \u201d, a game made with S.e.u.c.k. classic, but with a twist, because you can use 3D glasses (red / blue) to play and enjoy the experience more.</p><p>It is a small tribute to one of Disney's science fiction films, \"The Black Hole\" from 1979.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ARGUMENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Year 2130. After a year and a half of space exploration, the \"Palomino\" ship heads to Earth, but on its way it detects another ship, the \"Cygnus\" next to a black hole, in an area that it should not be able to. be by the laws of physics. Before continuing, we will have to explore this strange phenomenon and see what happens. For this, one of the most advanced exploration robots will be in charge of entering the ship to find out what is happening. You are that robot: \"V.I.C.- CENT\". (Note: The original name is \u201cV.I.N.CENT\u201d, but for a Commodorian, calling it VIC is better).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>PHASES</strong>\n</p><p><strong>Phase 1 - \"Assault\":</strong></p>\n<p>You will have to travel through outer space from the \"Palomino\" to the \"Cygnus\", avoiding the dangers of it to reach your goal. Meteorites, space traps, support ships, defense robots, etc. They will be in charge of preventing you from entering it. If you succeed, you will be closer to your goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 - \u201cCygnus\u201d (Special phase for 3D glasses):</strong></p>\n<p>Strange and enigmatic, but packed with defenses to ward off invaders. Will you be able to go through it to see what lies beyond?</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 - \u201cBlack Hole\u201d (Special phase for 3D glasses):</strong></p>\n<p>Everything has become chaotic, you have to get out of the Cygnus, but the only way out is the path you are traveling, it goes straight to the black hole. You have to escape their attraction and get to safety!</p>\n<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>\n<p>Lives: 4 / Extra Life: 10,000 points.</p><p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Development and programming: Commodore Spain<br/>Image Tittle Screen: Commodore Spain (idea by @errazking)<br/>Music title screen: Coming soon<br/>Load music: Coming soon<br/>Genre: Shooter<br/>Engine: Seuck</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL GAME POST</strong></p><p>Commodore Spain:\u00a0https://www.commodorespain.es/black-hole-3d-nuestro-primer-juego/</p><p><strong>NOTE!!<br/></strong>\u00a0We attach the two versions of the game:</p><p>- Original (compo) without improvements.<br/>- New version with improvements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T05:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c10b1fddd34bb67fe8f4f68a14f50086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Commodore Spain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
