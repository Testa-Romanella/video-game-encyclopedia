Don't worry! It's included in the prototype as a readme for reference.</p>\n<p>A few quick things before starting:</p>\n<p>1: This is a prototype. Function over polish is the name of the game.</p>\n<p>2: As this is a prototype, it is very unfinished. So if possible, I hope you'll be able to provide feedback on the most basic of things;\u00a0 be they obvious or otherwise.</p>\n<p>3: This is a short gameplay prototype for the base game</p>\n<p>3: There are many features that don't have a proper UI and as such, are finicky to work with. These are listed here.</p>\n<p>NOTE:<br/>Currently, there is no way to change settings in game. But there is an config ini in the appdata folder. It's created after loading the game for the first time.<br/>If for whatever reason, something is not loading correctly, delete the config ini and/or save file and reload. Otherwise, report it as a bug.</p>\n<p>The UI:<br/>The user interface is easily the roughest part of this prototype. As such, there is still some debug information listed there.<br/>Currently, health, points, level goal, world, level, seed, and the gun wheel are present in text form.<br/>The level goal tells you what you need to do to continue to the next level.</p>\n<p>Gun wheel:<br/>This lists the guns currently in your possession. As of right now, you can only have one of each color weapon for a total of three guns in your wheel. This approach may or may not be changed later on.</p>\n<p>Color Coordinated Criticals:<br/>These are relatively self explanatory, but still pretty rough in execution. Here's the basics of how they're implemented.<br/>Red guns (shotgun, spur) are effective against red enemies.<br/>Greed guns (rifle, pistol) are effective against green enemies.<br/>Blue weapons (bat, homing shotgun) are neutral to all enemies.<br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: I realize those who are color blind will have difficulty with this. I am open to suggestions for later phases of development to attempt to solve this issue. The current plan is to use distinct sounds in addition to color.</p>\n<p>Criticals are signaled by a high pitched ding sound (it varies slightly to avoid repetition).<br/>Neutral hits are signaled similarly, but will be a consistent lower pitched.<br/>Less-than-effective hits are signaled by a rough smack sound.</p>\n<p>Safe Rooms:<br/>After so many rooms, you will spawn in a \"safe rooms\" here, you can buy augmentations or save.<br/>There are currently two sections of these rooms. A \"story hall\" and a \"vendor hall\" the story hall is self explanatory, but the vendor hall is used for saving and augmentations.<br/>To use either, approach them, and a makeshift menu will appear.</p>\n<p>Augmentations:<br/>These are currently very rough in implementation as well.<br/>Approach the vendor, and three selections will appear: body, legs, and arms.<br/>Body augmentations will often be mostly stat related, such as health or bullets.\u00a0<br/>Leg augmentations will be movement related.<br/>Arm augmentations are more unique in their effects, such as increased knockback, as well as knocking the player back as well.</p>\n<p>You will need to kill 10 points (red orbs) to buy a single augmentation and only one of each augmentation can be equipped.</p>\n<p>QuickSaving:<br/>A very basic saving system is implemented at the \"bar\" where you approach, and a \"[save?]\" prompt will appear. When clicked, a save file will appear in the appdata folder and the game will close.<br/>Upon reloading, you will spawn back in the safe room with all previous stats, augmentations, and weapons.</p>\n<p>Bugs &amp; Suggestions:<br/>For information on reporting bugs and any suggestions you may have, check the pinned discussion topic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T04:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46e4f9215fd4bbb3bb47abb1d2948208.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cpaz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
