It's completely beatable, but even I have to admit it's not Kirby's Epic Yarn, that's for sure (nor is nearly as good). I will update the game and tone down the difficulty a bit after the ratings, but meanwhile, I'll leave a complete playthrough in youtube for people who want to see the ending or want to understand how to play it a little better! Also, A and D are for changing speeds. You'll just want to speed up (D) if you want to speedrun or speed down (A) if you want to make the game a little easier.<br/></em>\n<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</em></strong><em> Sadly, I uploaded a game that completely broke the game because I'm an idiot. Long story short, the game over state didn't reset after dying once, requiring you to reboot the game or else you wouldn't be able to progress. I've been informed that we could upload patches for game breaking bugs, so please, download the FIXED version. I have to let the original upload intact though. Thanks!</em></p>\n<p><strong>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>444: 4 Colors, 4 Ninjas, 4 Sale </strong>is a game about ninjas, quick reflexes, capitalism and and weird af ending because I couldn't actually finish the last level.
