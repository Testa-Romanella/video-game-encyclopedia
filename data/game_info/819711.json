Was he a man that was turned into a chimpanzee or merely a chimpanzee with the memories of a man?\u00a0Time to find out. We wanted to make a JRPG style of game as far as encounters + story beats. There elements of RNG in the fighting as well as the encounters.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is our second game jam as a team. We have a few different members this time, and we had a more varied skillset. We were able to experiment with making more sound effects this time as well as working harder on our original art assets. We had a broader idea from the first day, but it eventually got shortened down to this. It was a ton of fun to work on as a team.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Michael Muniz\r\n</li><li>John Queen\r\n</li><li>Britney Allen\r\n</li><li>Alex Cunningham\r\n</li><li>John Wheeler\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Some SFX provided by zapsplat.com including ambient noises, leaves rustling, gun shots, bird calls, and insect noises.\u00a0 \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90d/90dfbf499bb12b85fc1bbca52b56e2f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chzydeath"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
