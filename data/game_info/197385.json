I wanted to try my hand at making a game in PICO-8, and since I didn't have a laptop, I\u00a0picked up a PocketChip to make it on. Although it's not much of a game, I'm pretty happy I\u00a0got something working despite not using PICO-8 or lua before.</p>\n<p>Might develop the idea out a bit further at some point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/034bb641d49e1ae919689a2c59c34273.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["denmanrooke"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
