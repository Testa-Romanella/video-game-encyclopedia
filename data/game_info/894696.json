How should we straighten out our mentality<br/>       Human nature makes people desperate, but it also has warmth.<br/>       If the house is gone, can we make a decisive decision. As long as the family is safe, why not be home all over the world!<br/>       Maybe we don't understand each other's situation, but we can try to communicate. Light and darkness are optional.<br/>        Life is short, why not live in the present!<br/>        What's the meaning of existence when human beings compete for land and meet their desires without restraint!!!<br/>        As a producer, there are times of frustration.
