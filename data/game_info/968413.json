The defense team must hide and protect a money bag (bounty). The offense teams must capture the hidden money bag and return it to their respective bases, or eliminate all players to win the round.<br/>\r\n- Competitive play: With three teams competing, the stakes are even higher. Each team must keep an eye on the actions of the other two teams as they battle to capture or protect a planted money bag. Teamwork becomes more important, including balancing offense and defense, and making quick decisions to support or engage.<br/>\r\n- Over the course of nine rounds (each round is three minutes long), each team must quickly determine which team is a threat and which team is an opportunity in an ever-changing situation to tip the game in their favor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T05:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c5b6979d765933eebfb068f63ded8d.jpg", "website": "https://www.bountycityvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SG ENTERTECH"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SG ENTERTECH"], "esrb_rating": null}
