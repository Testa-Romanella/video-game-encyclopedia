When you complete a track in the time displayed you move on to the next map.\u00a0The game will take you on a journey through our solar system letting you use 3 different cars. The timer is always going (unless you go to the pause menu) so be quick, the timer will reset when you pass the finish line so that you can try again. Instructions are available in game.</p>\n<p>There is also a Free-Play mode where all the cars are available, here you can drive around however you want in New York (just to try out the cars).</p>\n\n<p>Install:</p>\n<p>Download the zip-file, then save all folders and the\u00a0executable file titled \"Engine Revver The Final-Game.exe\"\u00a0 to your desktop. Then run the exe. file,\u00a0then click new game once in the game. Instructions are in game. After completing the game you can try the Free-Play mode where you drive around in New-York (you can start with this although there are no instructions here so I would recommend to start with the actual game). When you go to the pause menu and either exit the game or go back to menu the game will save so that you can click the 'Load' button and start off\u00a0 at the scene\u00a0which you left the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b58432f2c103531d78e34e5758c88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["FM game studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
