Atoms split on impact and bounce around the stage. The goal is to not get hit and split enough atoms to get to the next stage. At the end of every stage a boss appears and must be defeated to win the level. To stay alive the player can collect health and upgrades for his gun. The game uses the Unity engine and a retro/cartoon artstyle. All assets (except the upgrade sprites for health/ammo and the laser shaders) are selfmade.</p><p>This game was developed in the course <strong>Game Design and Development 1</strong> at Graz University of Technology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a23e6b355819c66e951cd706d3fb8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wombatzl", "MaX_van_HeLL", "tgruber", "kmalek", "fthaler"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
