Fortunately the sport of PWND has rocketed to the rescue, entertaining luddites of tomorrow with spectacular displays of corpse defiling domination.<br/><br/>In PWND, the kill is just the beginning. In order to score, you must pwn by performing a close range victory dance on your downed opponents. But be careful! You\u2019re completely vulnerable during your victory dance, so make sure your team\u2019s got your back or you'll find yourself on the wrong end of a pwn stack. <br/><br/>Situational awareness and team communication are critical for pulling major PWNage. Teamwork becomes ever more important as the stakes get higher and higher over the course of a match. Experiment with different combinations of characters to find the perfect combination of skills and abilities for your crew.<br/><br/>Included in your PWND purchase:<br/><ul><li>3 multiplayer maps designed for death-defying vertical combat.<br/></li><li>4 characters with unique play styles and diverse strengths and weaknesses <br/></li><li>New character and map coming in September!<br/></li><li>20 Single Player Challenge Mode Levels to hone and tone your PWN skillz. <br/></li><li>Pay to Win?

Each character has their own set of skills for you to master on the road to victory.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>The action doesn't stop when your opponent is crawling and wheezing their last pitiful breath. What fun is that? Big scores come from the PWN, a display of weaponized disrespect atop prone opponents. Rub it in, but be careful: strategy and teamwork are required lest you lose the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swagger baby, it\u2019s all about smooth buttery style in this throwdown town. Collect PWN stamps, skins, and gear to keep it fresh.
