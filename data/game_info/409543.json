The game is a short immersive walk though an expansive section of land with moss, glacial rivers, foggy grasslands, waterfalls and scenic vistas. Use the game&#39;s camera to observe and interact with the world around you while listening to an immersive curated soundtrack. Your attentiveness and eagerness to explore will be rewarded with access to hidden areas, areas that will be easily missed by a rushed player.<br />\nI&#39;ve been able to utilise some great new technology in Unreal Engine 4 and some high-fidelity photoscanned models from Quixel to try and push the visuals in this game as much as I could. I hope you are able to dive into this game without much context and just enjoy being immersed in the world. Thanks for playing and for your support !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T14:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7f120cb62c7bdc27c5b4fc78bef3731.jpg", "website": "https://cavesrd.itch.io", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 316, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["caves rd", "Matt Newell"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["caves rd"], "esrb_rating": null}
