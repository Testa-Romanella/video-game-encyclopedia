My specialisation was game graphics.</p>\n<p>I made this project for Pebbles Project to use in their ECD centres to teach children the different farm animal noises. I am hoping to expand it further to include many different themes in the future.</p>\n<p>With this project I wanted to make something\u00a0 that would be easy to understand, visually fun, and quite colorful. I wanted all the graphic elements to fit together and look believable in a farm setting.</p>\n<p>All 3D assets and their textures are my own. I modeled and rigged them in Blender and painted the textures in either Photoshop or Procreate. All UI elements were drawn in Procreate by me.<br/></p>\n<p>The animal sounds, feeding sounds, and ambient noise are from a pack I purchased on the Unity Asset Store and the intro music is a royalty free\u00a0song I downloaded from Pixabay. All other sound, including footsteps, were recoded by me.</p>\n<p>For the script I took the code Brakeys wrote in his Quiz game tutorial and modified it with the elements I needed for this game in particular.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/935c10e2504594ccb3d66315fd9a41c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Megan Nel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
