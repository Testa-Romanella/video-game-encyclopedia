Help me get through school and find your way out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou start at the one corner of the map and traverse the maze through to the end on the other corner.  The number of moves you make are counted and there's also a running stopwatch.  Try to get the lowest number of moves and times! See if you can average a minimal moves-per-second-and still make it out!  Compare with your friends and see who made it out the quickest and with the lowest number of moves!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T12:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d34/d342ce2c7fd3362ff16af3a9e600f445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andres Gonzalez"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amino Acid Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
