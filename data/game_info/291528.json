Placed 2nd in a college game event. The challenge was to make a game with the theme 'Gravity'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Thwart'n Newton you play as Einstein as you try to navigate the 2D platformer and stop Newton from opening a black hole. Find the key, open the door and face Newton inside his tree fortress. lol Do not let the awesome description fool you, this game is very simple. Watch out as the gravity will change and you will need to traverse the level UPSIDE DOWN!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>left-right arrows: to move</p>\n<p>Spacebar tap: to jump + (hold) jump higher</p>\n<p>Thanks for any support. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f57e637063faad62b91873870a45475c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SickoGamer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
