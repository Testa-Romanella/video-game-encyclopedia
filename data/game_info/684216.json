This is completely legit. All of the files (currently)\u00a0are for GBA(Game Boy Advance), and you will need a GBA emulator to run them. Personally, I'd use John GBA Lite if you were to do this on mobile devices. For PC, Windows and Mac, I'd say use No$GBA or Visual Boy Advance.</p>\n<p>This is a non-profit project, just did this cause I felt like being a madlad. Also, roms are like super underrated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:48:18", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Pianist"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
