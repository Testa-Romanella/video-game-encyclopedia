{"id": 926087, "slug": "spoopy-garden", "name": "Spoopy Garden", "name_original": "Spoopy Garden", "description": "<p>This is an entry for <strong>My First Game Jam: Winter 2023</strong>.</p>\n<p>We were given two weeks to make a game that surrounds the theme of \"Growth\".</p>\n<p>In Spoopy Garden, you will plant ghostly seeds, and upon harvesting them, a ghost will sprout forth and reside in your garden. You play as a witch (of sorts) and will assist these ghosts in breaking the curse that is keeping their souls from reincarnating normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Important things to note:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The first thing you should do is plant a seed. This can be done by pressing<strong> F</strong> while standing over<strong> fertile soil</strong>.</li><li>Soil degrades over time. However, maintaining soil can yield rewards! <strong>Coarse soil</strong>, and <strong>overgrown soil</strong> cannot have seeds planted in them.<br/>\n</li><li>Hold Tab to select a tool. The <strong>sickle</strong> is used to cut overgrowth. The <strong>rake</strong> is used to till<strong> coarse soil</strong>.</li><li>If you're out of ghosts, there is a way to get more... Perhaps someone can help.</li><li>Different ghosts have different stats. As a general rule, Light-type ghosts can generally take more hits, whereas Dark-type ghosts will hit harder.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game is complete up to the first of three planned bosses.</p>\n<p>It's designed to be completed in one sitting.</p>\n<p>There are some bugs, and there are probably\u00a0more that we not aware of. So please feel free to lend your thoughts and criticisms.</p>\n<p>Alchemy was a planned feature, but I am just learning programming, so I could not get to it in time.</p>\n<p>In spite of this being put together very quickly, we hope you enjoy the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spoopy Garden Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Character art by genericDragon and Lampy</p>\n<p>Ghost art by genericDragon\r\n</p>\n<p>Environment based off \u201cSideScroll Worlds SET1\u201d by Szadi art\r\n</p>\n<p>https://szadiart.itch.io/sidescroll-worlds-set1\r\n</p>\n<p>UI based off \u201cPixel RPG UI Pack\u201d by Immunity\r\n</p>\n<p>https://immunitys.itch.io/pixel-ui-pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Venture treasure chest from \u201cMana Seed - Treasure Chests\u201d by Seliel the Shaper\r\n</p>\n<p>https://seliel-the-shaper.itch.io/treasure-chests\r\n</p>\n<p>Shaded pixel art achieved with use of Laigter by azagaya.\r\n</p>\n<p>https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter\r\n</p>\n<p>Parallax background by TheWiseHedgehog\r\n</p>\n<p>https://thewisehedgehog.itch.io/tmb\r\n</p>\n<p>Background generated by \u201cPixel Space Background Generator\u201d by Deep-Fold\r\n</p>\n<p>https://deep-fold.itch.io/space-background-generator\r\n</p>\n<p>Designed and programmed by Lampy\r\n</p>\n<p>Music composed by Lampy</p>\n<p>Game made with Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ty, genericDragon,\u00a0Sinetic\u00a0and the My First Game Jam Discord community</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/737a00998d82f153fc647a0b97537ab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Lampy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
