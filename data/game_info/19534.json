Now her fellow students have turned on each other as the school descends into chaos. Cordy must battle feral classmates and dangerous creatures as she ascends to the cruel Administrators\u2019 offices atop the Edgewood Home for Lost Children. <br/><br/>Our Darker Purpose is a top-down, rogue-like action RPG that combines the ingenuity of genre-defining classics with the expansiveness and accessibility of modern day action adventure games. The gameplay is steeped in a variety of influences ranging from A Link to the Past to The Binding of Isaac to Diablo. We love games with great mechanics and awesome, bizarre storylines, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re creating with Our Darker Purpose. <br/><br/>Each playthrough features a unique set of procedurally generated levels. Death is permanent, but your accomplishments earn you resources to buy lesson and upgrades in the afterlife... and your education lasts forever. Every game teaches you more about the Edgewood Home for Lost Children, the disappearance of the adults, and the darker purpose of the Administrators.Key Features<br/><strong>Fast-Paced, Combat-Oriented Gameplay</strong>: Face unique boss encounters and challenging enemy mechanics! The Edgewood Home is a merciless environment. Dodge between fireballs and flying desks while your former classmates try to pummel you into the walls, and that\u2019s just the lower levels\u2026 <br/><br/><strong>Character Variety and Customization</strong>: Assemble selections of randomized perks and upgrades to reflect your play-style \u2013 tanky bruiser, glass cannon, fleet-footed assassin, or anything else. Assemble your skills into devastating combinations\u2026 or pick style perks with no benefit at all, at your peril. <br/><br/><strong>Oh Yeah, and It Takes Place in a Sinister Orphanage</strong>: Prepare for a an unflinching look at what happens when an already terrifying boarding school/orphanage goes all Lord of the Flies, and try not to get eaten by any of the possessed furniture. Only the psychologically strongest gamers will be able to withstand the insightful taunts of the Administrators themselves\u2026Gameplay<br/><strong>Allocate precious skills </strong><br/><br/>Uncovering Edgewood\u2019s dark secrets will yield valuable experience for Cordy. Each time she levels up, you\u2019ll be able to select from one of two new abilities that she can acquire, depending on your play style and the situation at hand. You will never be as strong as you need to be, so prepare for some nail-biting choices\u2026 <br/><br/><strong>Choose your own ghastly fate </strong><br/><br/>The house is different every game, and every level is uniquely generated. But fear not, there\u2019s more than one way to ascend through a dystopic Victorian manor!

Of course, each floor offers unique credit tokens to buy new upgrades, so choose wisely\u2026 <br/><br/><strong>Acquire eternal powers </strong><br/><br/>Adorable, creepy, stylized Edgewood Home students don\u2019t give up when they fail --- they go to class. Each time you lead Cordy to a fiery (or chalky, or spikey, or venomy, or monstery) demise, you get some time to strategize with your kindly scarecrow guidance counselor. He is happy to offer his one-of-a-kind insight in many academic disciplines\u2026", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2014-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:13:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea844e2e678a34d3494283427f2ecb9.jpg", "website": "http://www.ourdarkerpurpose.com", "rating": 3.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 208, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 64, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avidly Wild Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Avidly Wild Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
