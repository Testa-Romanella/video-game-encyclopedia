It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We  arbitrarily identify one square as the \"ant\". The ant can travel in any  of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The \"ant\" moves  according to the rules below:  </p>\n<ul><li>At a white square, turn 90\u00b0 clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit\r\n</li><li>At a black square, turn 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Langton's ant can also be described as a cellular automaton,  where the grid is colored black or white and the \"ant\" square has one  of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of  black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant.</p>\n<p><strong>Source code<br/></strong></p><p><strong>https://github.com/aikoncwd/langton-ant</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8cd5cfbbf5c7cecb026fcec95acf14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["aikoncwd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
