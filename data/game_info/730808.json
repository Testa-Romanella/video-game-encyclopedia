It turns out that they had wandered into Penny's Lab right as she was finishing her latest invention, The Melodic Microphone Mk V. BF and GF then fall out of the vents through a little doorway in the same room Penny was in. BF then notices the mic Penny was holding and decided to challenge her to a rap battle.
