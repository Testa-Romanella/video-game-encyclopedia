Theme: \"Modernizing a classic\".</p>\n<p>https://play.unity.com/p/tricky-ball-1<br/></p>\n<p>We chose to modernize a classic toy by Tomi called Tricky Ball. In this game you had to move a ball across the board by pressing big yellow buttons, each one activating an obstacle. We thought reviving this fond memory was a fun way to experiment with the Unity physics engine and test different animation scripts. And also, who doesn\u2019t like to press a big yellow button ?</p>\n<p>Diversifier : language independent. Just press the buttons!</p>\n<p>Team : Sabrina P, OBG21, ChristianAndersson</p>\n<p>Tools : Unity 2020.3.8f1, Blender 2.92</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T05:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/928/92828949e45284c8f81e3d2025c959c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SabrinaP"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
