{"id": 406456, "slug": "factory-tufduck", "name": "Factory (tufduck)", "name_original": "Factory (tufduck)", "description": "<p>This is my first completed game, a remake of the old Nintento Game &amp; Watch game Mario Bros.\u00a0It's made in the Godot 3.1 Engine.</p>\n\n<p>Bob and Amanda are factory workers. Their job is to feed boxes filled with hazardous chemicals onto fast-moving conveyor belts, and to catch the boxes on the other end of the belts.\u00a0All of this needs to be done under supervision from the mean\u00a0factory manager. Any mistake in the production line, and he won't hesitate for a second to run out yelling on poor Bob and Amanda.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>You, as the player, control both Bob and Amanda simultaneously. Your objective is to deliver as many boxes as you can, thus getting the highest score possible. The game gets progressively more challenging, as the conveyor belts run faster and faster\u00a0and the boxes come out more frequently. Every time you fail to catch a box it will crash to the floor\u00a0and the factory manager's anger meter fills up. When his anger meter reaches the top, it's game over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D -\u00a0Bob</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - Amanda</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>David Renda for the music (https://www.fesliyanstudios.com)</p>\n<p>Kenney for the graphics assets (https://kenney.nl)</p>\n<p>Vicki Wenderlich for the original wall background texture (https://www.gameartguppy.com/)</p>\n\n<p>Happy playing!
