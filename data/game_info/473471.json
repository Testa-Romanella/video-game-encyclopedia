The Crafting system is taking the cards into the slots and hitting the crafting button. What is happening behind the scene is that the crafted card goes back into the deck along with the other two cards. You\u00a0<strong>start</strong> with 5 water,fire,air,earth mana cards. Everything else is your creation. <strong>Sorry for the inconvenience I will update it in the notes or make it more obvious after the game jam is over.\u00a0</strong></p><p>Concept: Casting spells take so long sometimes to fire off. Ever wonder why it takes so long? Lets do it through cards and see how long it takes for you to come up with powerful spells.<br/>Idea: I personally liked card games but they were so much about min-maxing that it hurt my brain trying to jump into games like Hearthstone or Magic of the Gathering. How cool would it be if everyone started with the same amount of cards, same types of card, and can only do so many moves before their opponent can make their move.<br/>Why magic though? Why not? Casting in some games takes a second to fire off and other games takes like 20 seconds. The higher you level up in those games the faster and more powerful your spells become. What is actually happening in the mind of the caster? What are they feeling? How much thinking do they need to do to get the concept and put it to use? Well that's why I made this game.</p>\n<p>Note: That there is no audio due to bad management of time on my part during the game jam. However, if the game does have audio when you download it, That means I came back to this little game and decided it was best for music.\u00a0<br/><br/>Everything that is in the game was made by me with the help of the Unity Game Engine.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T06:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/89279732d28bd1c0cd09308f65fbdce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Helpinghand97"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
