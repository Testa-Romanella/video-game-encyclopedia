When the world has a proper form for the language you're using (in this case Latin), the ?? ending will be replaced with the proper ending. Words can also be dragged on top of each other to form sentences, though right now there's no UX for if a sentence is 'correct' or not.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The Latin used in this is a subset of the full Latin grammar ruleset, with verbs, nouns, adjectives, prepositions, and participles covered. There's lots of fun levers on this project (enabling and disabling various word categories/qualities in puzzles etc) that I'd like to mess with. The grammar and vocab data. while not editable in the application, is all designer-defined.<br/></p>\n\n<p>There is also definitely grammar mistakes that need fixing, often on the backend right now -- early test!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da414f2543e1796275f64fb82cbc0a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Schoelz"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
