It is an effort at resurrecting the dead shopping mall of my youth in response to a sense of dwindling commons. Through virtual necromancy my collaborators and I attempt to resuscitate a space that once provided human connection. Within this ruin of the future, we build fugitive worlds together, and tell stories inside stories to keep warm.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This project includes:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>\u201cDownstream a Shining Wire\u201d a 3d environment recreating a semblance of the former Cottonwood Mall. The space includes an original musical score by Ultrademon.\r\n  </li><li>The soundtrack to \u201cDownstream a Shining Wire\u201d as 10 separate tracks (MP3).\r\n  </li><li>\u201cCottonwood Mall Scrapbook\u201d a 3d environment comprised of images and blueprints of the mall scraped from the internet and government archives. (This environment includes many hi-res image textures and may run slowly on some machines)\r\n  </li><li>The videos \u201cthe Black Rabbit of Inle\u201d parts 1 and 2, and \u201cthe Shining Wire,\u201d digital videos recorded in virtual reality. In the videos we act out scenes from Richard Adams\u2019 Watership Down\u2014wherein a warren of rabbits must seek a new home together after their original home is destroyed by property developers. They recount rabbit myths to inspire each other to keep going.\u00a0\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>This work was produced by Tabitha Nikolai, Ultrademon, Allynn Carpenter, Zanna Kerrigan, Cassandra Gladwin, and sam.<br/></p>\n<p>A version of the mall is currently publicly accessible on the VRChat platform. It can be accessed by creating an account and searching for the world (Downstream a Shining Wire) in the worlds menu. It is made public in this form so that anyone who can access VRC can likewise use the revised mall for their own commons, and their own stories.</p>\n<p><em>This work was made possible in part by support from the Open Signal New Media Fellowship, and the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art's Creative Exchange Lab.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/512/512f3982af9d357ec7da7352f2bc58f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tabitha Nikolai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
