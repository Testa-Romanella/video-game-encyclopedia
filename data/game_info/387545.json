After collecting all the crystals, you have to go back to the exit and place the crystals in the Crystal Shield again. However, after collecting the last sixth crystal, the character will be a bit scared, and the dungeons will get darker, which will frighten you even more. To avoid fear, you must have a Magic Lantern with you that will illuminate the area. You need to watch your fear level, because with 100% fear you die and lose the game. Collecting all six crystals will be hampered by map mobs. The game also contains spells, a magic fountain and many different items. The game is not easy. It took me 45 minutes to win this game. If you want to download this game, good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a008a0177f34db7f63f37582d648bf07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kelly303"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
