The bird must lure other birds into the glass walls weak points in order to break the glass, this forces the owner to get a bigger aviary's until the owner give up containing you and\u00a0sets the birds\u00a0free. The theme chosen is \"Thin Borders\" and that is the bases of the breakout. The thin border is the glass wall and the darkness beyond is a metaphor for the feeling of entrapment. The irony of the border being thin in when to the bird it is large.</p>\n<p>The whole game was made in three hours but the art assets were drawn just before the three hour development since it was allowed. I did not have time to add music or sound which is a regret.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8badab33479779d4e1a3da50b64a268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["proTaleDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
