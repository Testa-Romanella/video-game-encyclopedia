In the game, you need to help the flying birds keep moving forward. During the process of moving forward, be careful not to touch the pillars of different heights, otherwise you will have to start over again. The player presses the spacebar to fly again, ensuring that the bird is in the appropriate position, able to maintain flight while crossing obstacles. The longer the flight time and distance, the higher the score obtained.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/11980a56981baa1dc0ba30b4e9c82952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wang huimin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["wang huimin"], "esrb_rating": null}
