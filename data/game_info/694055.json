{"id": 694055, "slug": "spirit-rpg", "name": "Spirit RPG", "name_original": "Spirit RPG", "description": "<p>Spirit RPG is a prototype for a game we worked on around 2015. Play as Aspen and Hazel as they befriend spirits, in an attempt to\u00a0save their home world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaining Allies</strong></p>\n<p>In order to befriend a spirit, you have to reach an accord with them\u00a0\u2013 while making sure no one falls in battle!\u00a0Enjoy this caring take on a\u00a0traditional turn-based JRPG system, where Mana is transferred through your actions rather than depleted, and\u00a0no one is trying to defeat each other! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Using Spirits</strong></p>\n<p>Each spirit you befriend can be 'equipped' to one of your characters, granting them different in-battle abilities. They will also enable actions outside of battles, such as growing vines or healing creatures. Learn about each individual spirit, and work together to overcome all obstacles on your path!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The game can be played with standard RPG Maker controls (Arrow keys to move, Z/Enter to confirm, X/Esc to cancel and open the Menu). There are no timed elements,\u00a0 so play at your own pace!</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE </strong>- The prototype involves one playable area. As this was a demo build, there are references to surveys \u2013 please ignore these. There may be bugs or missing features (including one spirit which cannot be befriended in this version).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/261f18670436ee952af4509f3f7ec44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tea-Powered Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
