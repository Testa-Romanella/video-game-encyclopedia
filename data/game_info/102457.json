I use remote connect with Putty to debug/launch the game on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dba98bc96f2109d22754474e92025e02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daivuk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
