The theme was<strong> Stronger Together. <br/><br/></strong>In this shooter you'll control two ships on different sides of the screen. One with the <strong>arrow keys</strong> and the other with <strong>WASD</strong>.

The purple shots can hit both. The waves are randomly generated with increasing dificulty. <br/>......................................................................<br/>HOW LONG CAN YOU SURVIVE?<br/>......................................................................<br/>---------- Controls: <br/>-------------Blue Ship: <strong>W A S D</strong><br/>-------------Red Ship: <strong>Arrow Keys<br/><br/></strong>If you wish to, you may download the game here as well<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/410/4105f4373dad0c34fcf9d898b85032e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CapBruno"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
