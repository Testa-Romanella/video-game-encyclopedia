The game is based on the television series Superman: The Animated Series. Superman was released in North America on May 31, 1999 and in Europe on July 23, 1999. It is the first 3D Superman game.</p>\n<p>Development of the game was largely hampered by constraints from DC Comics and Warner Bros., resulting in it being unfinished and of a poor quality. BlueSky Software attempted to re-do the game for the PlayStation, but due to Titus&#39; expiration of the Warner Bros. license by the time it was completed, this version ultimately got cancelled.</p>\n<p>In the game, Superman must rescue his friends from Lex Luthor, who has trapped them in a virtual version of Metropolis. The game is infamous for the very negative reception it received from critics and is widely considered to be one of the worst games of all time, being heavily criticized for its poor controls and graphics, technical bugs, repetitive gameplay, and difficulty. </p>\n<p>From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_64</p>\n<p>There was a playstation version in the works, but it was cancelled before it was released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-04T22:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/726/726768c2b5681a6a3315e2903fc5cc9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.75, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Titus Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Titus Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
