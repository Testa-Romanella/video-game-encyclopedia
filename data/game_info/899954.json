But I will try my best to make it a bit more play-able before the\u00a0Jam review, so my effort doesn't go to waste. The main battle mechanic was never implemented, so the game is basically just wander around, get into battles, click the enemy with the mouse until it\u00a0dies.\u00a0 So just enjoy the atmosphere for now.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>Once again it's almost hear, Christmas crunch time. There is no rest, there is no escape.\u00a0You've been worked to the bones for the past 36 years and you can't spend another minute putting together another crappy\u00a0Disco Skeleton mini-fig for some human brat who doesn't even deserve it. You hear rumors about those who've attempted to escape the Factory.\u00a0It isn't pretty, but neither is being a slave to the Beast in Red. That does it, no more! It's time to get out of this Holiday Hellscape and get your revenge.\u00a0As Frosty as my witness. This will be the LAST CHRISTMAS!</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Default controls</p>\n<p>Move with WASD</p>\n<p>Interact with Space Key (You chat with certain elves, and enter battles with enemy's by going up to them and pressing the interact key.</p>\n<p>When a battle starts there is No gameplay. Just use your mouse to click on the enemy picture and it will deal damage until it dies. Fun... I know...</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Main Tileset:\u00a0https://franuka.itch.io/rpg-snow-tileset</strong></p>\n<p>*a few crappy edits and tiles added by me</p>\n<p><strong>Battler Images:\u00a0https://franuka.itch.io/rpg-christmas-battler-pack</strong></p>\n<p>*note:\u00a0Battler Images were poorly edited and Animated by me</p>\n<p><strong>The Battle Backgrounds:</strong> were actually created by me.</p>\n<p>The one exception being the snow background has elements taking from\u00a0https://dusan-pavkovic-warlord.itch.io/snowybackground\u00a0and the tileset I used.</p>\n<p>Some song tracks from:\u00a0https://void1gaming.itch.io/christmas-music-pack</p>\n<p>And here\u00a0https://timbeek.itch.io/dystopian</p>\n<p>And here\u00a0https://eric-the-funny-baron.itch.io/barons-music-pack</p>\n<p>All other sounds and music\u00a0found through:\u00a0https://freesound.org/<br/></p>\n<p>or\u00a0https://sidearm-studios.itch.io/ultimate-sound-fx-bundle\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T17:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59b013db2f0ad49b513e8adbe8a01a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BobIsHere"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
