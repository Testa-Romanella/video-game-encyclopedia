The goal of the game is to defend your village and stay alive. Your defender army is growing at the village by time, so your main task is to cause chaos, to slow down your approaching enemy, and to reduce its force as much as you can. You are alone (as a guerilla fighter) to accomplish your task, but you can shoot, place down turrets and TNTs, and drop smoke and flash grenades.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T18:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8893a4bef6d44d4eff661e2ea4e0023f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poppy_Seed"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
