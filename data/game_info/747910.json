Your sister Chloe has tasked you with cleaning your room, and you must try to pick up all the things before each round's time runs out. Pet slimes, drink boba, and hop around to see how many gold stars and stickers you can earn!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm Didi Kim and this is my second Unreal Engine 4 prototype, developed over 25 days for the GAM-303 Design of Virtual Game Environments class at SNHU. I\u00a0was tasked with taking an existing game design document and interpreting it in my own way. I chose this particular scenario to challenge myself in designing for the target audience of children. I hope you enjoy it, and please let me know what you think! <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:07:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a2164011d6bad7e50811aa13625db1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Didi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
