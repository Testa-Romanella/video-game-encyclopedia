When the King's time is drawing to an end his two heirs will compete in a festival throughout the kingdom in order to prove who is best suited for the throne. While everyone in the Kingdom is aware of the festival's purpose, anyone is free to partake in the events on the low chance that a better candidate is found and for this purpose there is a large selection of events for everyone to try out. At the end of the festival there is an event for everyone to watch before the results are announced. While obviously the winner of the festival will be named the next ruler of the kingdom, there are prizes for those who finish with high scores, these are as simple as a tax exemption as well as land and supplies, these prizes have been used as a way to encourage the general population to partake in the festival and try as hard as they can. The events in the festival have been designed to test the different qualities that the current King has decided are essential for the next ruler.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T07:26:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd3d39cb24ace71ee2e5f3401214b6aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan_Marshall"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
