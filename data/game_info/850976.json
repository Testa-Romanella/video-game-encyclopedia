Talking about those rooms to an interested listener could bring  some of your precious memories back. Or maybe you will lose even more... <br/></p>\n<p>So basically this is the same game as \"those rooms of mine\" but with a pixel filter. Originally this filter was planed as an option in the settings of \"those rooms of mine\" but I had to change some effects and textures so I decided to post it as a new game.<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"those pixel rooms of mine\"</em> is a classic indie horror game with some  puzzles and two different endings. A playthrough is about 45 - 60  minutes and the game does not provide any save mechanics or checkpoints.  Maybe to not destroy the immersion or maybe because I was simply to  lazy to implement those ;). It is somewhat a sequel to \"maybe I can wake  up by force\" however you don't have to play that first. <br/></p>\n<p>Have fun and please tell me what you think. If you find any bugs or issues I will fix them as fast as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T10:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6e5eba0e9621128e8ccfcc55437a00c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["woodychucky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
