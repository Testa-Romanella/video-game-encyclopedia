Roads take him till the end, and these roads become thinner as the game progresses. The player has to remain balanced in the road and reach the endpoint collecting as many coins as possible. Those coins will be located randomly on these roads and they will be of two types giving them different scores when they collect them. There is also a big gem present at the ending point of the game so when the player picks the gem the game finishes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nCharacter\r\n<p>The only character of the game is our player (a ball).
