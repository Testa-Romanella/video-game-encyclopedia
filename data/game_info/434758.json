You are cyber-future  pizza delivery person equipped with a shield that can block and parry  shots from the towers along your route. Their energy fields pass right  through humans so standing in front of the bullets will do nothing.</p>\r\nTOWERS\r\n<ul><li><strong>Basic Cannon:</strong> Fires projectiles at a set interval. Every third shot will be a pink projectile. Parrying it will return to sender and destroy the tower.</li><li><strong>Sniper Cannon:</strong> Never fires pink projectiles. Make sure to pay attention and block! Looks similar to basic towers but blue.</li><li><strong>Laser Wall:</strong> Placed along the rail, make sure to find the connected button to disable it. If not your pizza will take damage when it passes through.</li></ul>\r\nPICKUPS\r\n\n<ul><li><strong>Heal Pizza:</strong>\r\nRestore 1 slice of your pizza.</li><li><strong>Shield Pizza:</strong> Protect the pizza from damage for a short while</li><li><strong>Pizza Boost:</strong> Increases the pizza speed for a short while</li><li><strong>Pizza Slow:</strong> Slows the pizza for a short while</li><li><strong>Player Boost:</strong> Increases the players speed for a short while</li></ul>\r\nCONTROLS\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong> - WASD</li><li><strong>Block</strong> - Hold Right Mouse Click: Blocks projectiles.</li><li><strong>Parry</strong> - Hold Left Click: Parry only works on pink projectiles.
