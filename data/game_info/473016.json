People are invited to explore the relationships between their movements and the procedures which transform the shape and sound of the environment. It\u2019s a space for contemplation of the emergent complexities within structures composed of simple, repetitive transformations.</p>\n<p>The surface is generated with a kaleidoscopic fractal algorithm. This is a procedure that repeatedly draws polyhedrons while transforming the space by folding, scaling, translating and rotating. These structures are then tessellated to make an infinite lattice.</p>\n<p>Angeline was created in Unity with a custom raymarching rendering algorithm. As opposed to the light thought of as entering our eyes from space, this technique projects rays into space and takes steps along themselves until they intersect with the kaleidoscopic surface.<br/><br/>Note: If you experience a black screen, take your headset off and put it back on.</p>\n<p>Tested on Vive and Oculus Rift<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a225c3f2797b2c299e84a1b66889b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["connor bell"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
