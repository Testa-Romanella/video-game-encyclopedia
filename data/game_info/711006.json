It's based on a simple thing which is that a fantasy island world got infested by slimes and ghosts which you as a wizard have to get rid of. The game has 8 difficulties that you cycle through throughout the game. The difficulty increases every time that your score crosses a milestone. On the second difficulty a new enemy will appear which will be the ghost. But watch you not to collide with any of the enemies because that would result in an immediate death. Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7529280a3b20acf81a54357d817b2509.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hosty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
