You modify the terrain, design mountains and valleys, equip your facility with real estate and set up a sophisticated traffic system. The various traffic lanes can then be populated with rail and road vehicles, which can be regulated with a sophisticated signalling system. Air and sea traffic is also represented. However, the focus is set on the railway world with steam, diesel and electric locomotives, as well as passenger and freight cars, all available in a wide selection. In addition to the high quality reproduction of the rolling stock, which aims to be faithful to the original, EEP offers a great depth of play with endless possibilities for building and operating a great network with complex scenarios.<h3>EEP EISENBAHN.EXE PROFESSIONAL 17 - NEW</h3><ul><li>Two complete train sets of the Alstom Coradia iLint, the first passenger train in the world to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell for environmentally friendly zero-emission transport.
