You play as a boy, who is afraid to fall asleep, for fear of the dark and of the nightmares that await him. His mother tells him, \"just count sheep, and by the time you get to 10 you will be asleep.\"</p>\n<p>The game involves finding all 10 sheep in the dark dream world, armed only with your flashlight.</p>\n<p>The boy is controlled with W,A,S,D (or arrows), and the mouse.</p>\n<p>Every time the game is started, you will play in a proceduraly generated map, with randomly placed sheep. This makes every play through unique.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for Mini Jam 105. It was both my first time ever using Unity and my first time participating in a jam. I only had about 6 hours of total free time to work on the game, so it was very rushed. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fbfd854b0edb1683fddaebdd7318a2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["idlecore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
