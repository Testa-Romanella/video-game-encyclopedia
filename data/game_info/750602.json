(You are basically telling everyone in the room \"hey, look at me right now!\" )`. I know this is kinda wrong, i am not really good explaining stuff, much less when i am still trying to understand it (but in my mind it makes sense how it works lol)</p>\n<p>I found information in google about it but i wasn't able to understand it. \"Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are exactly what the name implies: method-calls on remote clients in the same room.\", now that i have my own understanding of it, this makes sense.</p>\n<p>This is essential for networking, i might be able to make more online games with this thanks to Photon PUN2.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tileset creation with Clip Studio Paint</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>I havent made much, but now i know how to make tilesets with Clip Studio Paint (which i thought that it wasn't possible)</p>\n<p>This implies being able to create layer instances of another file, so when you modify the source file, all the instances will reflect these changes, which saves up work and time.</p>\n<p>Tilesets are done on a grid that CSP offers, so its much easier to import into Unity.</p>\n\r\nWhy?\r\n<ul><li>I wanted to learn this.</li><li>Multiplayer games are fun.</li><li>Request by a community for another project.</li></ul>\r\nShitty art\r\n<p>I made all of this in Clip Studio Paint. Nothing serious, weird and random elements i added just so the project doesn't look plain white with squares moving around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Tile: grass corner\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n Tile: grass center\r\n<p>Character 1</p>\n<p>Character 2<br/></p>\n<p>Character 3<br/></p>\n<p>Character 4<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f9a17d8a2257971499212f768144031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gann4Life"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
