It can be adjusted, but the UI may break if you change the screen size by too much.<br/>A PC that can run Unreal - Ideally you will want a smooth 60 fps while running or you'll encounter erratic behavior in game (particularly with the input buffer not working properly). Reducing the screen size seems to improve performance, but again same warning as above.<br/>~600 MB of space - Not entirely sure how the file size got so big, but I blame Unreal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:00:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4a0ef269db36a57b45641c3a676d99c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eld0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
