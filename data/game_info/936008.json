As such, the basis of the system being discussed here - the so-called disciplinary council itself - will not translate seamlessly to players from countries of which the school systems do not employ the same pedagogical strategy for dealing with \"problem students\". However, said players will still find the underlying core of the game to resonate with their own school experience, or that of others they met.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that this game be played twice, one for each ending.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f00/f00c115aebee2b8b4b91fd5100c12b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EdgarFlex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
