You are tasked with tending to this garden in order to fend off the representations of various harmful emotions that plague it. During play, you generate a resource\u00a0off\u00a0the land which you can then use in order to plant various flowers in the garden, providing defenses or weapons against the blight that plagues it.\u00a0 Your ultimate goal is to entirely heal the Eden you inhabit before it is consumed by the blight. <br/><br/>I made this game as a college assignment during the pandemic, and\u00a0wanted to make it a reminder to myself to practice self-care and tend to my own feelings. To do so, I wanted the gameplay to feature an analogy of the mind as a garden, and have a generally self-reflective and deliberately mindful experience where you are able to tend to that garden after being put in the shoes of various people who aren\u2019t in the best state of mind.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to post this project online as it is very personal to me, but I figured that I'd do so anyway in case someone might feel a genuine connection to my work.</p>\n<p>As with Monochrome, I've enabled donations for this project, but I don't see it as a product and rather would only encourage people to donate if they wish to support me directly.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Extra credits:</p>\n<p>Audio/Music:<br/>Ambient Noises: Noise Machines -\u00a0 Dr. Ir.
