This game is unique compared to other games I produced in the past. I designed this game specifically without having to rely on additional resources or people! I build a complete game from scratch and take it all the way to being published on Itch.Io to share with people who can play this game as well!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started Super of the Bomber gradually through a simple prototype of using simple primitive shapes like cubes and spheres. Once I was comfortable with the concepts, I continued to expand by adding 3D models to replace the prototype assets. I expanded further by adding sound, music and UI until Bomb of the Super was complete. I took one step at a time and broke everything down into small tasks so my skill level will not feel overwhelmed.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: W (Move\u00a0Up), A (Move Left), S (Move\u00a0Down), D (Move Right), Esc (Pause), Click the Pause Symbol on the top right corner (Pause), Space (Drop Bomb)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/514/51440c5f3a98cccd3d63922cfd50ad65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
