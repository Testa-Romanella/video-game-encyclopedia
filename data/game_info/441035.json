When \"The Saurian Horde\" invaded Earth, our world has no interstellar travel of our own. The only way humanity could survive was by colonizing their vast and cavernous motherships, colonizing the worlds where they land, and spreading out amongst the stars like an infestation of bed bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>While the grown-up refugees of Earth struggle through their ragtag, \"bandages and blasters\" existence and cling to the last little pieces of human civilization, a number of brave kids have taken it upon themselves to sneak aboard alien vessels and steal technology, to carry news between worlds and star systems, to fight back against the aliens, and to lead humanity into the future. Nobody told these kids to run away and become our heroes. In Jump Rangers, kids really are the future... and that future is now.</p>\n<p>The Corebook is here, where you can also purchase all the expansions in bulk at a dicounted price:\u00a0https://jumprangers.itch.io/corebook</p>\n<p>What you're looking at here is:</p><p>INTEL FILE 3: CRITTERS OF THE GALAXY</p>\n<p>Loaded with animals from all corners of known space and beyond, animal-related characters and locations, and even a mission centered around evacuating the animals of Planet Armageddon, this is a book in every way about the animals of Jump Rangers!\r\n</p>\n<p>Questions?
