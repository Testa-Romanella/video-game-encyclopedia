{"id": 904797, "slug": "senet-itch", "name": "Senet (itch)", "name_original": "Senet (itch)", "description": "<p>Senet is an\u00a0ancient Egyptian board game. Each player moves their pieces depending on the number they get on the dice. Enemy pieces can be swapped and you can block the other player's movement by forming rows with your pieces. Some squares have special markings - when you fall on them, you can be protected, may have to move back, or need to get a certain number on the dice to leave the board. The player who removes all their pieces from the board first is the winner.</p>\n<p>Please notice that the rules of this game have never been written down. There is no consensus\u00a0about how the game was actually played, so you may see other Senet games out there with rules slightly different from mine.</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0<strong>free</strong> to download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T07:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d5634302a562c44ef659784707b8d17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Herculano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
