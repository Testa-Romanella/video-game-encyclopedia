It is a digital experience that lead me to learn a lot about making games and\u00a0 handling the current engine I'm using (Gdevelop).</p>\n<p>It is a short game, consisting of 12 stages, meant to be completed in a single sitting. It might take 1 hour (It has no save system), if you take a few minutes to figure out how to beat the bosses\u00a0(It has no save system).</p>\n<p>From now on, I'll make this page my official donation page, for anyone interested in helping me keep making games, for I had a few problems with past donation pages. But don't worry, any payment here is optional.</p>\r\nHere are some important things you should know about the game, before playing:\r\n\n<ul><li>What inspired the making of this game?</li></ul>\n<p>Castlevania! The NES and SNES ones, in a sense that it's a game about a single being facing creatures, saving the world against all odds.</p>\n<ul><li>Dood, it has fewer animations/effects/musics/anything than I thought!</li></ul>\n<p>I've included the downloadable version because the browser package had to be smaller (in file numbers) than the exe.</p>\n<ul><li>Where are the items?!</li></ul>\n<p>In most platformers the hero has a ton of items to help, in the original Castlevania games, the hero can only hold his whip and, maybe, a knife...<br/>Items and healing items are ways to avoid losing\u00a0 the game, and since this one has endless continues (and to make the file lighter), it has no healing items O:</p>\n<ul><li>This game is ugly/poorly made!</li></ul>\n<p>The effort to make this game was about 2 and a half weeks. I made it like a personal jam to understand my own game making process, so it isn't polished as a 1-5 year long project.</p>\n<ul><li>This game is bad!</li></ul>\n\n\r\nGameDev Facts!\r\n<p>Since I have many indie game devs motivating me to keep making games, here are some interesting development facts:</p>\n<ul><li>90% of the game happens in a single scene/stage, cut in smaller stages. This huge \"piece\" is a test I've made in order to understand how Gdevelop would handle big maps, for future projects.</li><li>The final boss theme was inspired by Castlevania's final boss bgm as well.</li><li>This game exists because I have this theory... That some creations need to exist before they make sense... I believe its a Nintendo influence, like Mario (a plumber saving a princess from a dragon), so randomness is created and then given a story to tie it together. It might end in a very lively setting.</li></ul>\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n<p>Technoaxe - for every music in the game.</p>\n<p>Kenney - for some of the sounds.</p>\n<p>@normanbatesjr - for her doggy :</p>\n\n\r\nWhy should I donate and help you?\r\n<p>I could go on and on about my personal problems, but I do this a lot on Twitter... Or I could explain how hard is the economy in my country (Brazil), but here's an image with a fact to illustrate it:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/1683e568b2b00fbdf8b37fad0e69b48e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adriano Silva"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
