With only a gun (which has terrible accuracy), you enter a desert in hopes of finding a mythical treasure. However, you end up in a cursed, seemingly-endless land filled with unpredictable monsters. Can you break the curse and escape?<br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and SPACE to shoot.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made in less than 24 hours. I hope you enjoy it! :) <br/></p>\n<p>Since this is a jam submission, expect bad art and some bugs :)<br/></p>\n<p>Music by HoliznaCC0 - \"Red Skies\", \"Sunny Afternoon\", \"Dance Till You Die\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T22:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff9ca20c7a24ea9c0344ecf009e4e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ShadowLT"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
