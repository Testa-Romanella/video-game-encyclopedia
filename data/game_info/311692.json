The player's point is to make each line's digit sum equal to appropriate column's sum using addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (\u00d7), division (\u00f7), squaring (^), square root extraction operation (\u221a), concatenation (\u2228) and clipping (\u2227) only. Concatenation assigns the number after to the right of the number (13\u22286 = 136). The clipping removes the indicated number of digits from the number to the right (358\u22271 = 35). <br/><br/>- 6 levels of complexity (up to 7x7) <br/>- a fascinating intellectual process to train your brains! <br/>- 18 levels tutorial <br/>- unlimited levels to play <br/>- minimal price <br/>- pleasant music <br/>- UHD (4K) resolution support (3840x2160 pixels)<br/><br/>As soon as possible:<br/>- trading cards <br/><br/>Develop mathematical thinking playing SQR 4!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c23498b18a861b45b040f429067e15.jpg", "website": "http://slygames.ru/sqr\ud83d\udd32-4", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sly"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SlyGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
