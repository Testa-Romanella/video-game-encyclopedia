They get stronger per level. So you will need to find better tools to beat them. There are spells and wands you can buy. In addition, you can improve your stats by sacrificing some gems that you have earned. There are multiple levels which are unlocked via your max level reached. Feel free to try it out if you are into defender and wand-skill based games.<h3>LEVELS</h3><br/>There are 3 types of levels in the game.<br/>Normal : Enemies are kind of dumb, and easier to kill. Lowest earning rate.<br/>Hard : The middle point between normal and extreme mode.<br/>Extreme : Enemies get stronger and start to go after you wisely. Highest earning rate.<h3>LIMITS</h3><br/>After 100 levels, spawn mode turns to chaotic mode. So they more aggressive increasingly. See how far you can go, and crash the game (literally).
