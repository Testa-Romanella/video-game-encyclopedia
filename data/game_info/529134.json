I made the tutorial section (without the lives) so if anyone got some free time to test it and give me some feedback i would really appreciate it. Is it hard? Boring? Repetitive? Bad controls? etc</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended to play with Gamepad</strong></p>\n\n<p>For people that have a bad internet connection and the game is lagging there is a download option with the EXE. Right now it only works with windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:12:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c77c40acf7e48875ddacabb9e1b3948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HollyEye"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
