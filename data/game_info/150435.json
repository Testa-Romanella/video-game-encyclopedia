There are 15 areas and 23 bosses scattered about, and they can be tackled in almost any order. Similarly to Dark Souls, the areas are interconnected, and you will have to explore in order to find a new path. I've only had one person beat the final boss, and would absolutely love to hear feedback from anyone who decides to spend some time with my pet passion.</p><p>Basic Controls (You do not have to read this in order to begin playing)</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys: Movement</li><li>Z or J:\u00a0Light Attack</li><li>X or K: Heavy Attack</li><li>C or L: Cast Spell</li><li>V or Semicolon:\u00a0Use item (Farthest right column in the inventory)</li><li>Space:\u00a0Interact and inventory (Use arrow keys to navigate)</li><li>F5:\u00a0Restart game</li><li>F4:\u00a0Delete save</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b5811820b8819ebb018f97c5e577f19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Laber"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
