The object is to physically attack and majorly dis your enemies until they are totally mortified beyond belief. You'll never come out on top without making the right friends, so be careful who you're nice to. Because in the end, only the shrewdest will survive with their social status intact!</strong><br/><br/>Delve into social gameplay like no other, playing with tenuous alliances and bitter rivalries on the harshest battlefield know to humans - the schoolyard playground. Who can you REALLY trust?<br/><br/><br/>On your way to becoming the universe's most popular girl you'll experience:<br/><ul><li>Dynamic social gameplay - each round is never the same! Deception, trust, tears - all part of the playground.<br/></li><li>Meet new friends along the way; you're gonna need some friends to beat the other losers!!<br/></li><li>You can't get to the top without making a few enemies!<br/></li><li>Compare your stats with your friends (and enemies) on the rankings board. Will you be #1 on the Most Popular board or #1 on the Losers Board?<br/></li><li>Mix your gameplay up with customisable game modes. Just don't pick a \"cower only\" game unless you're all scaredy-cats.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Choose between 100+ accessories for your day on the playground. Your wardrobe starts off with the basics, so you've got choices like a bandana, headphones or a bone through your hair. As you earn more clout on the playground, you also learn a thing or two about fashion. You'll get access to things like cool new glasses (even if your vision is 2021), dollar bling, butterfly wings, fancy ties and even your own bodyguard! Did I mention that you'll also get earn full outfits from being popular, like prom dresses, mermaid outfits, 70s discotheque outfits just to name a few. Your wardrobe will be HUGE in no time, which is a good thing because who wants to wear the same thing twice in a row??<br/><br/><strong>Wait a minute, I'm getting deja-vu... doesn't this game look familiar?</strong><br/>If you used the Internet in the early 2000s, you probably heard about SiSSYFiGHT 2000, I mean who hasn't. Anyway, it's back and better than ever. We didn't think it was possible to improve upon SiSSYFiGHT but here we are.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T03:41:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/50505ab871f86f325f7481a38b41bebb.jpg", "website": "https://sissyfightclassdismissed.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Invergence Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Invergence Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
