The game uses binaural audio so playing with headphones is strongly recommended.<h3>Entities</h3>There are currently 3 Entities in this game, but the ones that stand out are <strong>The Howler</strong> which will chase you if you get too close, and <strong>The Smiler</strong> killing you if you shine light in his area.<h3>Community Driven</h3>If you want to contribute to the game you can do so by joining the \"active\" Discord Server or by contributing to the source code on GitHub.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T03:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990d882d9189477a4fa9b639f8210292.jpg", "website": "https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo/Budget-Backrooms", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidJoacaRo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lory Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
