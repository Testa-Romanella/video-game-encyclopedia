Just place your drone on the ground or floor and its time for takeoff. Accurate controls relative to your drone's orientation provide an realistic simulation to a real drone. However since this drone isn't real, we thought a cute animal pilot might add to the fun. Choose from up to ten Hover Pets to pilot your drone. This drone is fun to fly!
