You can consider this to be an alpha build. Following is a list of changes I expect to make before the next build:</p>\n<ul><li>Add ability to choose the number of points to win</li><li>Add an animated background</li><li>Additional puzzle types that require different solutions</li><li>Gamepad support</li><li>Various performance fixes and optimizations, if deemed necessary</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally, here is the current list of known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>The laser bends really strangely upon reflecting off of a mirror. I know why this is, I just don't have a solution yet</li></ul>\n<p>If you encounter any other bugs, let me know in the comments below. Most importantly, I have not tested the linux or mac builds, so let me know if you encounter any issues with those.\u00a0Currently, the game uses p2p connections for multiplayer, meaning hosts will likely have to port forward. I will investigate other solutions in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:26:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b08d3aae50376965b441e2640c1f0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tandunn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
