You can also \n      frequent the dog shop to rent dogs or buy new dog houses or meals for \n      your dogs. Your dogs can compete in races on a myriad of courses to \n      achieve titles and prize money, and you can breed your dogs to create \n      even better dogs. Raise your dogs and have them compete in competitions \n      with players far and wide over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. \n      Can you become the best handler around and raise a dog that can triumph \n      over all the competition?\n    </p><p>\n      Add-on Content November 15, 2010\n    </p>\n      \n        \n          Crystal house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Pink sky house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Japanese-style doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Star house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Paw doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Square-patterned doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Collage doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Pink honey house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Happy house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Brown checkered doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Quiet house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Adventurer doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Noble doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Kanji doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Flame printed doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Puzzle house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Biscuit house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Floral doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Classic doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Red checkered doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Brick doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Blue checkered doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Leopard-print doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Tiger-print doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Alligator print doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Gold house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Denim house\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Garage-style doghouse\n        \n        \n          100 Points\n        \n      \n    <p>\n      In-game content available for purchase using stored account funds.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
