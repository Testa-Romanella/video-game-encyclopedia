Press jump while you're in the air to jump again.<br/></p>\n<p>Whenever you start a level it will display the controls for that level, press jump to start.\u00a0If the timer runs out before you get to the end of the level you will die, so try and be fast.\u00a0Try and get used to the the changing controls and finish the game. Hitting red blocks or running out of time will kill you, orange blocks bounce you, get to the yellow block to win.</p>\n<p>Finishing with a high enough score lets\u00a0you unlock the three extremely difficult bonus levels; try and finish with only gold times and try to not die very much, then you will get a high enough score.</p>\n<p>Have fun this is my first game!</p>\n<p>Created for the 2020 GMTK Game jam.</p>\n<p>Music by Eric Matyas.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b4/8b40d0c1306c741607b6548cfc80f540.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrSkullInc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
