And I mean it, you <em>can't stop.</em> Even when you're away from a roulette wheel, a handful of dice, or a deck of cards, things around you seem to be inexorably tied to the unforgiving force of chance.</p>\n<p>When your luck finds you in a debtors' prison, your only choice is to escape. As your curse wreaks havoc on your surroundings, will you bust? Or will you hit the jackpot?</p>\nEvery step is a gamble...\r\n<p>This is a turn-based game, and each time you move, the enemies move. Every ten steps, every enemy will be affected by your Gambler's Curse\u2122 and transformed into a new random enemy by the roll of a die. You can see what enemies are on the die on the HUD, and make decisions based on how likely a certain enemy is to appear. Sometimes it's worth the gamble to hope that snake goes the other way, or that the enemy you're passing doesn't transform into a cyclops, but sometimes your gamble will not pay off.<br/></p>\n\n<p>All code, art, and sounds were created during the 48-hour game jam period by myself, outside of the sfx, which were produced by Chiptone. This game was made using the Godot Engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f6923665567f36610a64422da553d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["AaronHarman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
