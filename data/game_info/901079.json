Huge thanks to Sheepolution, Kya and Will for making such a incredible jam!</p>\n<p>Here are some words for my giftee:</p>\n<p>\"I'm really glad that I could prepare a game specially for you! I went for the climates of Dustforce and Celeste from all the games you've mentioned and tried to focus on a mechanic that is hard to master, but really satisfying when you learn it and I believe I actually achieved it! Hopefully, you will enjoy the game as it's what's most important to me. Merry Christmas to you &lt;3\"</p>\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n<p>A totally normal squirrel found a book in the forest one day.
