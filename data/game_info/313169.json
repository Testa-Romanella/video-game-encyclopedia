The game turned out to be more or less a slot machine without really any strategy or gameplay at all. However I've learned a lot while making it that I will use in the future to possibly make something better, so participating still was a really cool experience</p>\n\n<p>== GAME DESCRIPTION ==</p>\n<p>You are a manager at BH Incorporated - a company that takes jobs and send mercenaries to complete them. If the mercenary succeeds, we get paid. If not - we don't (and the mercenary dies).</p>\n<p>Your job is to make it to day 30 while maintaining the corporate standard - completing 1 job per day. If you run out of jobs or mercenaries, you will be fired.</p>\n<p>On days 10 and 20 you will have a chance to advertise your company to potential clients and employees (provided you have enough gold). Additional mercenaries can also be hired for 200G at any time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bd6dfd2cd2573a2ece8e2b1bbb1b19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reimthor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
