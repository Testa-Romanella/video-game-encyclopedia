Now nearly 2 years later, Toxic becomes a full quality game for the C64. Now Featuring:</p>\n<p>- Title/Loading multicolour bitmap<br/>- Full front end presentation with hi-score table<br/>- Plenty of atmospheric music to fit the game<br/>- High score attack. Basically score as many points as you can to reach a place in the hi-score table.<br/>- Compatible on PAL/NTSC and theC64<br/></p>\n<p>Your task is to clear toxic slime. This is achieved by spraying the slime with decontamination fluid.</p>\n<p>WARNING: Your back mounted tank can only carry a limited amount of decontamination fluid at any one time. Should your tank run dry, you will need to refill the tank at the refill point located at center of screen.</p>\n<p>To aid your mission, a geiger counter displays levels of radiation in the form of 5 colours: green, blue, yellow orange, red.<br/>The idea is to keep radiation levels to a minimum (green) by clearing toxic slime. Failure to keep on top of the toxic situation will result in radiation levels rising. This is shown in the form of an arrow located on the geiger counter. Should the arrow point towards red, which is\u00a0extraordinarily dangerous for humans,\u00a0the player will face impending death.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game design, loading bitmap, graphics and concept by\u00a0<br/>SHAUN 'WEC' PEARSON</p>\n<p>Programming, sound effects and music by<br/>RICHARD\u00a0 BAYLISS<br/><br/>Tape loader source by:<br/>PAUL HUGHES AND MARTIN PIPER<br/></p>\n<p>(C)2020 The New Dimension</p>\n<p><strong>*** COMING SOON ***</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(Currently at debugging phase)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/9448a0e9c95ce6256a54b875eeda2edf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
