The level resets when you get to 0 HP (can happen if you fall into the\u00a0<strong>V O I D</strong>)</p>\n<p>2)\u00a0<strong>Dice</strong>: This is the part of the game where luck is involved. When you collect them, you gain from -3 HP to 3 HP (you gain from negative a heart and a half, to positive a heart and a half.)</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0<strong>Spikes</strong>: These can do 4 HP, 5 HP, or 9 HP. (Totally not a bug)</p>\n<p>4)\u00a0<strong>Fall Damage</strong>: Fall damage comes from falling from a high place and hitting the ground too hard. The higher the place, the more damage. To be specific, fall damage is taken when you hit the ground with a y velocity of -8 blocks per second. The amount of damage in HP (1 HP is half a heart) is the y velocity in blocks(remember, it's negative) + 7.5, rounded down (You take more damage, not less)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47f5e3b598760166c37b8410dd68213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arnav K"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
