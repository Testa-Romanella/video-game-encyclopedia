{"id": 471503, "slug": "settlers-of-albion-alpha", "name": "Settlers of Albion - Alpha", "name_original": "Settlers of Albion - Alpha", "description": "<p>Settlers of Albion is a turn-based\u00a0defense strategy game about colonizing far-away lands. The goal of the game is to build settlements and upgrade them. Each time a settlement is founded or upgraded you gain development points. Reach a certain amount of development points (30 in this level) to win the game. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>To found settlements you need settlers. In each level you will start with a settler (it is the unit with the wagon).</p>\n\n<p> To found a settlement click on the settler and click the found hamlet button.</p>\n\n<p> When you select a settlement some buttons will appear around the settlement which represent the resources of the adjacent tiles.\u00a0 Clicking on any of these buttons will place a workshop on that tile and will start producing that resource.</p>\n\n<p> The game has 6 resource types: gold, wood, grain, sheep, stone, and horse. Gold is produced from settlements (taxes), while all the other resources are produced by placing workshops on tiles that contain such resources. To see the resource types each tile has click the overlay resources button on the bottom right (the one with the eye icon). <br/></p>\n\n<p>To increase the production of the workshops and settlements you need to upgrade the settlement. To upgrade a settlement click on it and click the upgrade button located on top of the building image.</p>\n<br/><br/>There is also a market button which will open the trading menu. From there you can buy and sell resources.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Building settlements next to trading ships reduces the commodity trading fees in the market. The more trading ships you have the less you have to pay for resources.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Missing Content:</strong><br/>The music and the sound effects for the game are still in development.<br/>This version of the game has no tutorial.<br/>This version of the game has no main menu.<br/>This version of the game has only one level.<br/>This version of the game has only one game mode.<br/>This version of the game has no win conditions.
