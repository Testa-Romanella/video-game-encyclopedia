The goal was to make something matching the restrictions of the old indestructible Nokia 3310 phone. The main constraints were the two-color palette and the 84x48 resolution.</p>\n<p>I find it fun to re-imagine\u00a0common software under such tight constraints. My\u00a0Nokia Jam 3\u00a0entry was the\u00a0Nokia eReader, a book reading app.<br/></p>\r\nSource Code and Licenses\r\n<p>The source code for this project is\u00a0available on GitHub\u00a0under the MIT license.
