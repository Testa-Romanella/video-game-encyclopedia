As the game was not completed fully, this is not explored in great detail. However, there would have been an explanation at the end of each playthrough that would differ based on the choices a player had made, which would explain how important diversity is.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of this concept was to give the player a first hand emotional experience of discrimination and how that can effect mental health and wellbeing.
