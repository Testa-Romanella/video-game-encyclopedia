He had fun playing around with his other baked friend and watching as the sun rose and set in front of the caf\u00e9. However, this would not last for long as he soon discovers, why he was made... One fateful evening, Shawn was on his way to bed when all of a sudden, he heard a bell. This was the same bell which rung every time someone would come into the caf\u00e9. Shawn's creator, the Baker, called for one of the pastries to the FOH (Front of House). Having never seeing what happens when someone comes into the caf\u00e9, Shawn was drawn towards the FOH. Slowly following after his friend, he hid in the shadows, watching to see what will happen. Slowly as time progressed, Shawn was struck with fear, heartbreak, and anger, as he watched the Baker give his friend to the person who came in and... ate him. Feeling repulsed by\u00a0this bizarre turn of events, Shawn rushed to tell all of his friends but to his surprise, they already knew this and were\u00a0ecstatic\u00a0about this. They spoke of how it has went on for years and how they dreamed and couldn't wait for their turn. They even decided that Shawn should be the next one to experience this \"<em>eternal bliss</em>\". Shawn's world was turned upside down, he couldn't believe the pastries he once trusted would be so sick and twisted. He decided to run away in hopes to escape this cruel repulsive tradition. Years later he is still tormented by all of the pastries who have met their end. He would hear some laugh and giggle and other scream and cries. Soon it became all too much for him so he decided to end it all where it all started, at the Living Brew. He would journey back to the place he swore never to return in order to end the person who sent his friends to a cruel fate. Little does he know, the Chef already had supporters who were willing to die for there turn at \"heaven\".\u00a0Will he get his revenge, or die trying...</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art by T3h &amp; Sop</p>\n<p>Code by Chris</p>\n<p>Lore by Chris, T3h, &amp; Sop</p>\n<p>Music by T3h</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T09:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/609211088c9172fab597705d1d8b08ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chips13", "T3h_n008", "sophic21"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
