Well unfortunately, they aren't ready for you. But you're in luck because my buddy has a million swords he can throw at you for your training.</p>\n<p><strong><em>TWO</em></strong> heads is better than one, so bring a friend and engage in\u00a0local split-controller multiplayer, where you split the hero in half and control their arms separately!
