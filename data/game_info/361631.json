You overslept! Even most jailers left the prison. Only you and ONE jailer \u201cPeter Tryhard\u201d are left. Luckily he lost his flashlight and you found it. Now you have to get out of the prison without getting catched by Peter. His eyes are used to the dark, so you can blind him with his flashlight. Take care and don\u2019t use too much power of your flashlight, because you have ONLY ONE battery left! Good Luck!</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D -&gt; Movement<br/>E -&gt; Interaction<br/>Mouseposition -&gt; Light direction<br/>Mousewheel -&gt; Increase or lower flashlight range</p>\n\n<p>Programming: Alexander Steinbach, Christoph Schulze</p>\n<p>Modeling: Alexander Steinbach, Viktor Steinbach, Christoph Schulze</p>\n<p>Music: Yuki Ogura</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c96efa49f45ca7ec64fb23c342b7d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magic Mushroom Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
