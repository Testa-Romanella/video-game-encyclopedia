Today is your  first day as her apprentice, and you need to help her brew the most  awesome and complicated elixir. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Can you be fast and competent enough</strong> to make it in the witching world?<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\n<p>In this game, you  need to do your best to assemble the ritual recipes and add them to the  cauldron to make the elixir. You'll gather ingredients, prepare them in  the proper way and bring those to a proper ritual place.\r\n</p>\n<p>The elixir is hard to make and notoriously unstable. Each recipe you assemble correctly and put into your cauldron, stabilizes the brew and brings you one step closer to success! You'll need to be fast and precise, or all will die in a deluge of fire! Just like Mr. Bones did. <br/></p>Keybindings \r\n<ul><li>Keyboard: WASD or Arrow Keys to move, E or Space to interact \r\n</li><li>Controller: L Thumb to move, A (or analogous button) to interact \r\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><br/>Changelog 1.0.1\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0Fixed a collision-interaction bug that made it hard to progress.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything made from scratch for the jam by the two of us, except for the music track. </p>\n<p><strong>Music: </strong>\"Sunday Picnic (ID 719)\" by Lobo Loco under Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.
