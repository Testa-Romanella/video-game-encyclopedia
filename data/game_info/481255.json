It's a 2D platformer where the player's hitbox is larger near the top, which lets you hang onto ledges and make really cool jumps. The game also uses an acceleration based physics system, with movement that relies on momentum. This game is also very difficult.</p><p>Music by wetua.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/1149c8eebda033438e6162f372e1715e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jcoptre"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
