I've uploaded it here so I can see them all in one place)</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE!\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You work night shift in a supermarket as a shelf-stacker. - This is the Supermarket Simulator part</p>\n<p>But then a series of misterious light-outs happen. - This is the Horror part</p>\n<p><em>Can you balance between stopping a murderer and keeping your job?</em></p>\n<p><em>Now you can find the answer!</em></p>\n<p>Use <strong>W,A,S,D\u00a0</strong>to move around and Shift to sprint.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>F</strong> to do actions, as: refill a shelf/fridge/etc, and to change a light bulb.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>C</strong> to drop coupons on the floor that will attract customers looking that way. (They are a bit short-sighted)</p>\n<p>Use <strong>Alt + F4</strong>\u00a0(or any other command with exit functionality) to exit</p>\n<p>Are you feeling <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the customers while you could be fighting the murderer's expansion?</p>\n<p>Then lead them to the dark zones with coupons! Less customer, less problem!</p>\n<p><strong>Don't stay too long</strong> in the dark places, because <strong>HE KILLS THERE</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>CAN YOU SURVIVE TILL DAWN?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>(If you die in the dark, it just brings you back to the main menu. Sorry, no fancy YOU DIED text)</em></p>\n<p>Ps.: This is my first game jam, I thought that it will be hard, then I thought that it will be easy, and in the last half day I realized that I underestimated :D</p>\n<p>And taaadaaa: here is a half-thrash game. Enjoy :)!</p>\n<p>(Sorry, but I used some royalty free (and also 1-2 unlicensed) assets, but mostly I made them from primit\u00edves.)</p>\n<p><strong>The post mortem is out:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84b53fd135edffaa047511d5178d0fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tudvari"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
