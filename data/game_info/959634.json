When an event is live, you'll get to pick your own fully customisable avatar. Then you'll land in one of Studio 5's virtual venues. You\u2019ll be able to move around, explore the venue and interact with other avatars using your keyboard and mouse. Get ready for a live performance like no other!<h3>The performance</h3>Powered by video 3.0 technology, you'll experience a real-world live performance captured as 3D video and beamed straight into a virtual venue. Nothing is pre-recorded. The artist can see everyone when they're performing, so be sure to put on your best dance moves and you might even get a shout out! You can send messages directly to the artist during the performance on our Discord too.<h3>Become part of our community</h3>At Condense, we want to bring the world's live events to virtual spaces, and we want to hear from you.
