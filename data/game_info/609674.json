Ludwig meanwhile is left with a single viewer, and must go out and confront Slime to settle things, because it seemed like a good story at the time.\r\n</p>\n<p>I made this in about 2 weeks,\u00a0working on it sparingly (I work full time) using the Unity engine.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can\u00a0<strong>mute\u00a0</strong>the music on the Pause menu (escape key).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Main Characters:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Ludwig-\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>QTCinderella-</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Slime\u00a0-</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator Section\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why did you make this</strong>?\r\n</p>\n<p>A: Isn't it obvious? To leech off other's successes, ya dummy...\u00a0but if you're gonna leech\u00a0 then you have to do it tastefully by bringing at least something of value. Hopefully this game provides a single moment of content.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Who are you?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0I run a small YouTube channel where I've been teaching how to make games to beginners. Tutorials are useful and I genuinely enjoy helping people, but I\u00a0don't want to be\u00a0<em>tutorial man.</em>\u00a0I\u00a0wanna\u00a0have more fun... making condensed games for clout seemed like a good option to try.\r\n</p>\n<p>Who knows? If it goes well I'll make a few more for other content creators\r\n</p>\n<p>Youtube Channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmB4ohLDFAWm2QX-h5uM_3g\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/853cc5fb1fdf167d59ef66fe7f87c178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BMo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
