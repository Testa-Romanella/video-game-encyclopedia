The objective is to defeat the enemy ships while preventing them from reaching your location.</p><p>This is a project I made for the Extra Credits Game Jam. Since the theme was Awesome per Second, I made a game where as little time was wasted as possible. Since I had unexpected personal events come up during development, I wasn't able to complete this game to its fullest. Despite that, I am very proud of the game I have created.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/580/580f2519f6fdf76546c7f3f8bf82bd39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nikhilbot75"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
