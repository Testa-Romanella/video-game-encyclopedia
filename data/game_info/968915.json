The only person alive in the whole reign is Mencia, a little girl who spends her time in taking care of animals and harvesting the crops, she is the chosen one, by process of elimination, like the saviour of the reign.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGuided by the magic sword, not by own will, Mencia will have to make her way through 4 levels, helped by the teletransportation power of the sword, facing all kind of different traps and aliens who have the intention of turning everything in front of them into squares until reaching their leader. Also \"squared\", of course.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBreath in, Mencia. You can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will be able to play \"Mencia: A never was tale\" with not only keyboard and mouse, but controller as well.

If you turn into a square you must start over again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game has been developed by Timber Films in colaboration with the students of the 3D Animation, Games and Interactive Enviroments grade of the Higher Vocational Training of Camara de Comercio de Sevilla Center.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T22:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/2070aba12fc7ae2ceaae77e0c70c32c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Campus C\u00e1mara de Sevilla - Centro FP Superior"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TimberFilms"], "esrb_rating": null}
