Summery\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I think the third assignment is mainly about how to design your own coding structure and make platform-independent interface . By doing this assignment,\u00a0I think I got a better understanding about how to deal with \u00a0different platforms.</p>\n<p>I made cMyGraphics.h and cMyGraphics.h files to deal with the differences in Graphics.cpp file. So now the\u00a0Graphics.cpp is completely platform-independent.\u00a0And I already separated geometry and effect parts, so adding another\u00a0geometry and effect\u00a0are easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.

Others</p>\n<p>I think I have a better understanding about\u00a0how to make a platform-independent interface that make users don't need to worry about the platform differences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I checked the memory of a single effect &amp; a single Object takes up in both platforms, but I don't know how to make it smaller, and I know smaller the data becomes the better. So I think I will think about this and discuss to others.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81b/81b68ae0ec17333a5bbafeaf3d254cbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zzzemma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
