There are no right or wrong answers to the choices you make as you play, only how you want the scenes to feel.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this game is still in development, some assets are placeholder and parts of the game, including the script, will be unfinished.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Lead, Project Manager, System Designer, Writer, Programmer</strong></p>\n<p>Nic June</p>\n<p><strong>Character Artist</strong></p>\n<p>Ronald Murray</p>\n<p><strong>Character Designer and Concept Artist</strong></p>\n<p>C.
