Your parents have just left the country so they can expand their business - time for your reliable personality to fully shine. You're on your way back home after a party, when you get this extremely good idea to see how your ex-girlfriend is doing. As you jump over her backyard fence, you trip and smash your head on the pavement. Next thing you know, you wake up in an unfamiliar apartment. Who sheltered you remains a mystery. What's even worse, is that you don't even know if they've sheltered or kidnapped you. All of these worrying thoughts are certainly not helping the headache you're feeling. As you progress, you start realizing this place isn't like any other - strange things start happening. Doors that were never there start appearing out of nowhere. That's not even the weirdest thing! There is a voice that keeps telling you what to do. Can you trust it? Will you manage to escape? It is all ENTIRELY up to you!Features :<br/>\u2022 You get to choose how it will all play out! The demo itself offers 5 very important decisions that will impact whether you'll escape or not.<br/>\u2022 The demo features two endings. Which one you get depends entirely on how well you choose.<br/>\u2022 The Unique Adventure pushes the boundaries beyond what you've seen in any other game, thanks to The Unique Punishment System. If you refuse to listen to the Guide, you get all sorts of punishments. At one point, you could lose the ability to hear anything but him... you know... just to make sure you're focusing on the right thing.<br/>\u2022 There are a ton of references - TV series, other games, popular brands with altered names, etc. All of that, so you can feel the pleasure of saying \"Wow, I know where this is from!\".<br/>\u2022 Since we realize how important the internet is, we decided to include cats in the game... If you feel overburdened by all the choices, you can sit back and watch The Unique Cat Commercial we've added!<br/>\u2022 Over 200 hand-crafted assets, made exclusivelly for The Unique Adventure! What you see ingame is a one-of-a-kind thing. That, plus the stylized art-style really bring the game to life.<br/>\u2022 Over 70 audio files and over 20 minutes of narration just in the demo alone! The Guide is here to help! The demo also features 7 different tracks, that will play as you explore the building. The power of the Guide's voice, combined with the OST's of the game really bring the project a step further.<br/>\u2022 A mixture of many different styles - we have a horror corridor, the escape room, the comedy hall, etc. All of that, so you can have a huge variety of choices.<br/>\u2022 A lot of interactible things. Some of the objects can be picked up and examined. Light switches can be flipped on and off. There is even a working range hood!<p>IndieGoGo Campaign : https://igg.me/at/the-unique-adventure</p><p>Steam Greenlight : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...</p><p>Press Kit : http://www.filedropper.com/theuniquepresskit</p><p>Our Facebook Page : https://www.facebook.com/darkestdesirestudio/</p><p>Our YouTube Channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCByPqtYUced51tvYQ...</p><p>Contact our Voice Actor : https://soundcloud.com/dominic-james-29</p><p>Contact our Music Composer : https://soundcloud.com/joshualfmitchell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/0574925fe8121945915b1d26f3eb5edb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Darkest Desire Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
