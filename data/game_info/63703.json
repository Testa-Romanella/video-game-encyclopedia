Brave the hazards of the castle tower, dodge the lunges of Squire Benoist the incumbent ghost and purge the encroaching pests - but don\u2019t let the food get cold! Get to the top of the tower in time and receive a reward that only a delectable and benevolent damsel can bestow.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCastle Clamber is an arcade inspired action platformer for one or two players, either locally or over a network. It tells the time-old story of a devoted underdog, blinded by a well-meaning sense of duty and a rose tinted visor.
