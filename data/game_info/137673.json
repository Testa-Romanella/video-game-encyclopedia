Use a variety of weapons to take down your foes, ranging from mines, to lasers, to black holes. Use your fancy flying skills to get where you need to be fast, and set yourself up for deadly runs at your enemies. Use your spin attack to whack enemies away from your heart, or even to knock your heart away from danger and into bandages to heal it. The waves of enemies only get tougher as the game goes on, but if you choose, you can manually activate the waves to bring on the pain even faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD to steer</li><li>Hold space to boost</li><li>Hold shift to brake</li><li>Move the mouse to aim</li><li>Left-click to fire weapon 1</li><li>Right-click to fire weapon 2</li><li>Spin the mouse wheel to perform a spin attack</li><li>Press P to send the next wave</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Nathan Powless-Lynes: AI and camera programming, level design, technical art, music</p>\n<p>Rachel Theil: weapons and audio programming, sound design, UI art</p>\n<p>Michael Arcadi: ship and systems programming, 3D art</p>\n<p>Additional music by Limes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47a3d6e2da4f9f0c5b8b1b963ccd2e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan Powless-Lynes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
