This mod is based on cartoon animation \"LEGEND of KILLY WILLY... (Poppy Playtime Animation)\" by Gametoons and also inspired by this mod https://gamebanana.com/mods/342042 . It's technically part of MAIN mod https://gamebanana.com/mods/285137. For covers I used FL Studio for Killy Willy and UTAU for Player. By the way, noises that Killy Willy made in his episode was not been good for cover so I used voice of Hypno from GT episode so technically Killy Willy is Hypno.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alternative link:\u00a0https://gamebanana.com/mods/344273\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e877dd29cf53bcc8b2c150840f0dd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiamGlow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
