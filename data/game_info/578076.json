If that wasn't tough enough, all games are controlled by the same keys, so any key you press affects both games at the same time! How may challenges can you complete before you lose all three lives?</p><p>Instructions for each game:</p><ul><li>Platformer: Jump on all the enemies. If one walks into you, you die.</li><li>Rhythm: Hit the arrow corresponding to each note at the right time. If you miss a note, you die.</li><li>Roller: Roll the ball towards the goal (the big white pulsating cube). If you fall off the stage, you die.</li></ul>\n<p>Code, art, and SFX by Birdwards\r\n</p>\n<p>Music: \"Come and Find Me - B mix\" by Eric Skiff - used under a CC-BY license\r\n</p>\n<p>Screen shader: \"VHS and CRT monitor effect\" by pend00 - used under a CC0 license</p>\n<p>Font: Exo 2.0 (Regular Condensed and Bold Expanded) by Natanael Gama<br/></p>\n<p>Tools used: Godot game engine, GIMP image editor, bfxr sound effect generator<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:56:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a671779d4f4fde4c89c23ef4fe71042.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Birdwards"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
