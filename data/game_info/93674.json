Work is now focused on mastering the tapes.\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for your patience and we hope you enjoy the game.<br/></em></strong><br/><br/><strong>Aim of the game</strong><br/>The evil Doctor Drax has been busy, dropping bombs onto the protected reefs. <br/><br/>Take control of Diver Dougal. Dive deep, defuse bombs, avoid\u00a0nasties... and watch out for alien artefacts!<br/><br/>Collect all the encryption keys in order to access &amp; defuse the bombs. Better watch out for the sea life though... Those creatures really hate intruders! <br/><br/>So set sail on the - Unsinkable 2- and make the sea a safer place.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Game info</strong><br/>Your trusty boat, the Unsinkable 2 enters from the right and drops Dougal in the water. From there you must swim down and collect each of the five encryption keys in turn and take them to the end-portal. Each time a key is used, the display on the portal will show how many more keys are needed. When all keys have been used, the portal will dissolve and Dougal will be able to access the bomb. This must be collected and returned to the boat before the countdown timer elapses. If that happens, it's well and truly game-over\u2026 <strong>BOOM!\u00a0 <br/></strong><br/>Successfully returning the bomb to the boat is the goal of each level. Dougal will climb back onboard the Unsinkable 2 which will take him off to save the next reef! Any remaining time on the countdown timer will be converted to bonus points before the next level begins.<br/><br/>On each level there are other collectables to find. Air cylinders and medipacks replenish air and health respectively. Occasionally the player will come across an alien artefact, no doubt dropped accidentally from a passing flying saucer! Collecting one of these is always a gamble. There are a random mixed bag of about 15 different effects this could have, some good but some bad.<br/><br/>You must battle your way from reef to increasingly difficult reef until you eventually reach Dr. Drax\u2019s secret dock. That\u2019s your chance to finish him off for good, but be warned- he\u2019s no pushover!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Playing the game</strong><br/>The game is controlled with a joystick in port 2. Use the SPACEBAR to pause.<br/>Keep a close eye on the countdown timer, if it reaches zero then it\u2019s all over! Press fire to collect the various items scattered throughout each level - trianguar encryption keys, air cylinders, medipacks or alien artefacts. There\u2019s also a lot of treasure scattered about in the form of gold coins. Simply swim into these to collect them for a healthy score boost! Please note that you can only hold one encryption key at a time. Take each one to the bomb portal and press joystick-down+fire to use the key. The number shown on the portal will decrease, telling you how many more keys are needed. Once you have used all 5 keys then the portal will dissolve allowing you to collect the bomb. Better get it back to the boat as soon as possible!</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Health and air</strong><br/>As you swim around underwater, the air in your cylinder will slowly be used up. Collecting air cylinders will give your air level a much needed top-up. Don\u2019t let your air reach zero otherwise your health will start to deplete!<br/><br/>Each level has it\u2019s share of genetically modified fish, all released by Dr. Drax to keep unwanted meddlers at bay! Allowing any of these to touch you will result in you losing a chunk of your health. Also watch out for Mermaids, normally they are quite peaceful they can\u2019t resist stealing air from passing divers! Whenever you begin a new level, your air will have been fully replenished but only some of your health will have been restored so be careful! <strong><br/><br/>Helpful hint</strong><br/>swimming close to the surface wherever possible will preserve your air supply because Dougal can breathe through his snorkel.<br/><br/><strong>Level codes</strong><br/>Every time you complete a level, you will be given a code for the following level. Always make sure you write these down as they can be entered on the title screen and used to begin subsequent games without having to start from level 1 each time. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch as the saying goes, so be aware that the higher the level you jump to, the less health you will start with!</p>\n<p><strong><br/>EXPLODING FISH - THE CREDITS:<br/></strong>Developed by Megastyle<br/>Published by Reset Magazine and Megastyle</p>\n<p>Programming, graphics and level design by: Chris Stanley<br/>Sprites and animations by:\u00a0Roy Widding and Chris Stanley<br/>Game music by:\u00a0Andrew Fisher</p>\n<p>Docs written by: Chris Stanley<br/>Docfile programmed by: Eric Hilaire<br/>Docfile graphics by: Roy Widding</p>\n<p>Loading screen by:\u00a0Rune Spaans<br/>Loading music by: Anders Rodahl</p>\n<p>Megastyle Game Intro by:\u00a0K\u00e5re Johansen and Roy Widding<br/><br/>Exploding Fish advertisement: Del Seymour<br/><br/>Thanks to Vidar Bang, David Eriksson, Ruben Spaans\u00a0and Chris Ledger for helpful suggestions and testing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b75b75475393b4188de78c3508606761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
