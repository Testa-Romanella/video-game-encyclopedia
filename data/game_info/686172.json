If you want to play with your friends you can choose to host a game by pressing the host button and sending the invite link to your friends. By pressing start the game begins. Use the Street View Symbol to go into Google Street View and look around. When finding a street view location correlating to a bingo word you can capture the scene by pressing on the Word. To see your recorded scenes you can press on the \"your pictures\" button. After the time has exceeded the game is over and you can see all captures you made and if you played online the captures of your friends.\r\n</p>\r\nHow can I add words to the game?\r\n<p>You can press the add button next to the text field and enter your word. Please also add tags to make it easier for other people to filter words.\r\n</p>\r\nHow can I play only certain tags?\r\n<p>You can omit the #all tag and only type in the tags you want. There is no way to exclude tags in the moment but you can always remove words manualy after pressing play.\r\n</p>\r\nI have a cool idea for the game or a different game mode. How can I get in contact?\r\n<p>You can join my discord or\u00a0write an email to\u00a0soeren.michaels+geobingo@gmail.com. I am happy to hear what you have to say.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e21c5a70339cd040b543d90978dde28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GeoBingo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
