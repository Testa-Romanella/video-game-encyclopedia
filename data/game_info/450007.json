The game was made by a pair of artists from Montserrat College of Art, and it uses their experiences in college as inspiration for the troubles and the solutions that players engage with.</p>\n<p>Final updates to come.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7bf901ce782c5d45d68020be3d83c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MontserratAIM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
