The whole gaming world takes place in the 70ies/80ies and is created in its typical look.<br/><br/>Start the trip from the green Flushing in Queens and go ahead until you reach the Times Square \u2013 the centerpiece of New York. The 15km-long Line 7 runs above ground for most of the route on the well-known N.Y. tracks. This time it\u00b4s your chance to discover the Big Apple from a track point of view while you are sitting comfortably at home in front of your PC. <br/><br/>Enjoy exciting missions either as the conductor or the driver. Due to the brand new Aggro-Mode (optionally turn on &amp; turn off) an evaluation of your handling is also possible during the drive. Always regard your speed, braking performance and stop position in the stations to keep your Aggro-display in the positive range. When the display is completely filled with red, your drive is cancelled.<br/><br/>WOS4 provides an interactive train depot with offices, a canteen and a garage. Talk to your colleagues at the interactive depot, listen to exciting adventures and try to manage them on your own. Expect tricky but most interesting missions, which will demand your driving skills.<br/><br/>Scheduled service with change of shifts, the original signal system and the interactive depot make the fourth part of the series as realistic as never before!
