As you struggle to free yourself, you realize that you are not alone - debris from your surroundings is also being pulled upwards, including rocks, electricity poles, and even entire buildings.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you look up, you see a massive spaceship hovering above you, its metallic exterior gleaming in the moonlight. You are terrified, but also curious - what do these aliens want with you? And can you use the surrounding obstacles to escape their grasp?</p>\n\n<p>In this 2D pixel art game, you play as a character who is being abducted by aliens and is being pulled up into their spaceship. As you float upwards, you must navigate through a series of obstacles that are also being pulled towards the ship, including debris from your surroundings and other hazards.\r\n</p>\n<p>Using your skills and quick reflexes, you must jump, dodge, and slide your way, surviving as long as you can, avoiding obstacles and enemies as you go.
