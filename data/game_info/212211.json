Several columns of falling blocks must be destroyed to earn points. Do not allow any blocks to touch the bottom, or they will destroy the special platforms located on either side of the game screen. The game contains several types of bonuses that can be useful, as well as those that are harmful. The 1-4 keys are used to activate additional weapons, but cost points to use. Nice graphics and music and a relaxed atmosphere make for a nice time. Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eeab9a70de08de3dfc9d1f3a1e245573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flying.Stone.Production"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
