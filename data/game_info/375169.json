Beware for other spaceships you may find in the way.</p>\n<p>After immobilizing the enemy spaceship, you may eject an invasion ship and use it to enter through the enemy's ship back entry. (yeah, we didn't plan this too well!) When inside you must kill all the enemies and go back to the back of the ship.
