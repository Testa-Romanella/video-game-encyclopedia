Most of these plants are cursed, however, so keep your scythe ready.<br/></p><p>This game was made for GBJAM 5. Programming was done by me, the art was done by Wayne Kubiak, and the audio was done by Tim Schrock. It was created in HaxeFlixel, and the fonts were made by ChevyRay.</p><p><em>UPDATE: Following several reports of crashes, I patched the game to better handle sprite recycling/sound management. Also, the Battle Farmer's portrait was showing up in the inventory screen regardless of the class you selected, so I had to fix that while I was in there.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af371cde1c62088973078282212eb5ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
