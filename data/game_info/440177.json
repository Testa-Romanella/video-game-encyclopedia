I\u00a0was given 4 weeks to replicate/iterate upon the mechanics of a game of my choosing (Zelda) and design a level by myself. Part of the assignment was that we were only allowed to use basic materials with no textures. All of the models used were either imported from some of the DS zelda games, or were created by me using Unity's basic geometry. For this particular assignment I\u00a0decided to make a 1-4 player game using mechanics from the game as inspiration.</p><p>Thanks for playing!! Feel free to leave feedback!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f64a0d8e6c0a3b561bbf8d2f11154f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luis Garcia Remes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
