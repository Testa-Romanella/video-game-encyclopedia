Fall back into a nostalgic state as you explore your bedroom looking for hidden keys to unlock the door to your imagination. Once in your imagination, guide your fumbling toy Goblin Goons to the castle before the Aliens can destroy all your Goons. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach new level in Batteries Included will challenge your speed, intellect, and cunning. Challenge your attention with the environment changing around you, the Aliens shooting toy darts, and even the UFO abducting the Goblins! Use your Magic Block Hex to build new hexes, your Alchemy Station Hex to transform goblins into trolls or sneaky thieves, knock down the Drawbridge Hex to charge, and blast goblins out of the Toy Cannon Hex to victory. The possibilities are endless to beat the challenges the Aliens have set out before you! Watch out for the Balloon Trap Hexes, Slippery Ice Hexes, spinning Toy Train Turnstile Hexes, and many more challenges!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVR brings with it the possibility for VR sickness so included the option for players to pick their locomotion system. Choose from Point &amp; Teleport, Click to Turn, Float Forward, and Jetpack Hands. Find the system that works best for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a1e7c9e5fa56e4a133182ac9c75687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadow Shrimp Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Shadow Shrimp Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
