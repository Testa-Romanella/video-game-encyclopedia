There are several suspects of having killed the young woman, but all of them will have a strong alibi. Some police officers will take the suicide version, but doubts will soon arise: Why would a promising actress commit suicide? With no hard evidence against anyone, friends, journalists, politicians, spies, assassins, military and police have their own ideas and orders and will interfere in the investigation led by the agents, while suspicions of a larger conspiracy loom over the investigation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T07:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/886141a85b874c874c03a8af95f39928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juancho Duma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
