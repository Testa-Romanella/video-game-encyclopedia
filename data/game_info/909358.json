But through Lockdown i was very active with GameDev releasing a string of FMV games lots of them stylised like old SEGA MEGA CD games from 90s.</p>\n<p>This weekend has been tough as i have also been looking after my 3 year old but whilst he's been playing and sleeping i have been hard at work with Sanity Farmer the game that Harvests Time and Sanity from the player.</p>\n<p>It's More an Endurance test to see if you can sit through all the stages of Increasingly more Glitched and subliminal and strange visuals and audio.</p>\n<p>After each stage the player is presented with a stats screen showing how much time and sanity has been harvested they then have an option to give up or continue the overall goal is to harvested all of the players sanity and as much time as possible. Clicking on the right side of the screen will allow you to progress and the left will allow you to give up and quit.</p>\n<p>The concept being clicking on different points of the right side of the screen will activate more and less intensive versions of the next stage some consuming more time and others draining more sanity.</p>\n<p>Being a single parent and trying to make a game in a weekend is a hard feat but im glad i have been able to produce something and do lots of fun stuff with my son at the same time (we been working on a lego city) However even now at midnight as im uploading the game he just woke up and i had to settle him haha.</p>\n<p>So because of that i couldn't implement as many extra paths as i wanted but still enough for the experience to work.</p>\n<p>The visuals where created using a Character i made years back and have used in several experimental projects over the years. A while back i started working on a strange video art film with the idea of turning into an NFT when that FAD was still big nothing came of that project so i reworked the visuals I started with that and completed them and i think they suit this project better. Everything was Created by me only.</p>\n<p>Overall it's been a good start back to gamedev with this strange little project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2907ddcd27ef5715f80411e9f8ec5fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lets go to the grindhouse"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
