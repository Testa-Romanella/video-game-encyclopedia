This is not an official Yu-Gi-Oh game. This is a \"FanMade\" game. Yu-Gi-Oh is not played normally in this game. It is played a little differently here and I wanted to use my idea to play like this in a game. This game is in the first version. And is still at the very beginning. Means that there is currently little content. Approximately 80+ playing cards, and currently only 3 \"raids / duels\". But we are currently working on additional content. Booster packs, new duelists like a story mode. If you have any ideas, feel free to write them to our Discord Server. Or of course also here. Thanks to all who support us!\r\nDISCORD SERVER:https://discord.gg/Bw9UDX", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f22da5b383a7feb52f849f101d61212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YuGiOhRaiders"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
