What an awesome app!\u201d<br/>\"Fast and accurate gameplay,  gorgeous graphics - you have to try this one - A+\"\u2028<br/><br/>Three game variations: <br/>- Classic. There is no time limit and you get three new pieces after each move that did not produce a line<br/>- Time Limited. New jewels will drop down after a time period.
