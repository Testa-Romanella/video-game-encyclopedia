I decided to make a game instead.</p>\n<p>You are no one, an alien being of unknown origin. Born into the void, drifting into the cosmos all alone. Will you survive?</p>\n<p>The game lasts as long as the track \"Sentinel\" itself but there is still a factor of winning and losing with different endings.</p>\n<p>You'll probably end up playing it many times to figure out how the game works which is the actual puzzle itself.</p>\n<p>I don't want to spoil the game anymore, see for yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy and let me know what you think. Thank you.</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/cavagrande</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/santimagames/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff0/ff00b6519a83a54c7c477db5fd9d702d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Santima Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
