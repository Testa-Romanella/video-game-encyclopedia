Be careful; your units can attack each other!<br/><br/>You can get more info about each part by hovering over it with the cursor.<br/><br/>* Move the cursor: WASD / Arrow keys / Mouse cursor / Left joystick / D-pad<br/>* Select or move unit: Space bar / Left click / A button<br/>* Unselect unit: Escape / Q / Right click / B button<br/>* End turn: Return / \"END TURN\" on-screen button / Y button<br/>* If playing with a mouse, you can move the camera by moving the cursor to the edge of the game window<br/><br/>Make sure you keep attacking! Units who haven't attacked in a long time will begin to starve!<br/><br/>If you get stuck in a stalemate, you can keep ending your turn until your units or the enemy units all starve.<br/><br/>## Combine units<br/><br/>After each combat encounter, you will be able to combine one of the enemy units with one of your own! Choose a unit to combine it with, or add it to your party as a new unit. You may have up to four units.<br/></p>\n<p>* Prev / Next: WASD / Arrow keys / \"&lt; PREV\" and \"NEXT &gt;\" on-screen buttons / Left joystick / D-pad<br/>* Confirm: Return / Space bar / \"COMBINE\" on-screen button / A button<br/><br/>## Cutscenes<br/><br/>After that, you'll get to read a visual novel-style cutscene!
