Even though there are some bugs, they will no longer be fixed as it is a product of the 48h challenge.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game has 3 phases:<br/>-Spam phase. Press any key as much and fast as possible to build up<br/>potential.</p>\n<p>-Angle phase: Use spacebar to lock a launch angle.</p>\n<p>-Scream phase: Use your microphone and scream as loud as possible in it. This is a direct multiplier on your potential! Press spacebar again while screaming to launch.</p>\n<p>You can exit the game from the start menu, that's it. Either finish one round and return to the menu at the end, or alt+f4 (I know, but eh, out of time).<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/>After the credits, starting a new game, keys will no longer be detected as input.<br/>It is possible to sometimes launch (frame perfect) at a 0 angle and thus getting hard-locked in the game. Alt+f4 is the only way out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T15:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/6052c18be0d104923a9a21424c94bc1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
