The game was made in less than 48 hours and had as a theme Downwell's Dual Purpose Design.</p>\n<p><strong>How does your submission match the theme?</strong> <br/></p>\n<p><strong> </strong> To match the theme, we tried to apply dual purpose (or more purposes) to every thing we could. <br/>In order to achieve this, you move around while shooting, which lets you kill the enemies and also get bullets from them. Also, if you are shooting, the time for your enemies will move faster and if you don't, the time will move slower. <br/></p>\n<p>Your bullets are your score (the final amount of bullets left before dying) as well as your ammunition. But be careful because if you run out of bullets, you die.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Third-party resources</strong></p>\n<p>Flash Professional, Flash Builder, Photoshop, Aseprite, Gxscc and Guitar Pro 5.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Contributors</strong></p>\n<p>Designer: Kevin Miles<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: Facundo Balboa <br/></p>\n<p>Music: Iv\u00e1n Piccione<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46f22300f015710021a2238d505bfe34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iv\u00e1n Piccione", "MonoFlauta", "KMiles"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
