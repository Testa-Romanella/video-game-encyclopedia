A game in which you can lose everything that you have accumulated in the past at once. A game that does not forgive mistakes.<br/><br/>You control an ordinary chip. Your task is to collect other chips on the field. For this you get points. Simple isn't it? The perfect game to pass the time on public transport on your way to work or school.<br/><br/>This is my first game on the Play Market. I hope you enjoy it and appreciate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d631864ff6b3dbfdd77196bc5513426.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["X6nder"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
