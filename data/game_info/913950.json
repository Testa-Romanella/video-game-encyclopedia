But on the factory floor, with the orders piling up and limited space, it becomes more difficult than you would have thought.<br/><br/>Mouse Only, place tracks on the left side of the screen to transport the sandwich to the exit. The orders on each level are on the right side of the screen. Whenever a sandwich moves near an ingredient table, it will add to the sandwich.\u00a0 You can use blue tracks, that switch position with every new sandwich, to fulfill different orders.<br/><br/>If you get stuck on a certain level, you can press Space to skip to the next level. You can also see the solutions to every puzzle at https://imgur.com/a/SV5stfs.<br/><br/>This game was made as part of Godot Wild Jam #53. The theme of assembly required reminded of factory assembly and sandwich assembly, so I made game that combined both of those into one experience<br/><br/>Any Feedback in the comments is greatly appreciated?<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T10:00:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick Browning"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
