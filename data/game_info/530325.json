Then put your unconventional human to the test in the obstacle course in this wacky physics-based game.</em></p>\n<p>Made in 3 days for the Jamingtons 10\u00a0game jam. Theme: Reinvent the wheel. I used this game jam to learn Unity's new ArticulationBody physics. I had 9 hours of sleep each night of the jam!</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>1. Pick a torso and attach limbs and other body parts to the green attachment points\u00a0via drag and drop. Hold the right mouse button when dragging a body part to rotate it. Press the letter next to a limb on your keyboard to see the action that limb does.</p>\n<p>2. Maneuver your unconventional human through the obstacle course. See if you can reach the finish line at the 100m mark, and collect all 15 coins along the way. Press the letter next to a limb to use it. Press space to use all the limbs at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Larger unconventional humans are heavier, and may be harder to move</li><li>Spamming a limb's letter very rapidly\u00a0may help in some cases. It can even let you fly if you hit it fast enough.</li><li>Keep trying! The physics are wacky enough that you can pass the obstacle course. You can always go back and create a new unconventional human using what you've learned.</li><li>Share your best builds in the comments. Screenshots appreciated.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>3rd-Party Assets:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music: Krampus's Workshop by Kevin MacLeod, Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/5518-krampus-s-workshop,\u00a0License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;\u00a0Sound Effects from the Sonniss.com GDC - Game Audio Bundle, and Universal Sound FX pack.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Secret Cheat Key:</strong>\u00a0forward slash (/) will give your conventional human a push; usable every 5 seconds.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/619e84d97cb596bb32e172bb24333bea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
