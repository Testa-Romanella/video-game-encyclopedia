It was made as a collaboration between twin sisters Kira Smith and Kate Smith for the Portland Indie Game Squad Summer Slow Jam in June of 2022.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With her foundations in fashion design, Kira had been wanting to make a paper doll game using her fashion illustrations for quite some time, so when she heard the theme of this jam, \u201cCharacter Creator,\u201d she immediately called upon game developer Kate to form her dream team.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Together, they toiled in Photoshop, GameMaker, GitHub, and on paper to create an interactive fashion collection inspired by Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and the book\u2019s themes of the impermanence of youth and embracing childlike wonder. Alice\u2019s journey invites the reader to consider the \u201cUnintended Consequences\u201d (the creative theme for this jam) of following your curiosity: a journey of self-discovery that may lead you to ask yourself \u201cwas I the same when I got up this morning?\u201d\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>I wonder if I've been changed in the night?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u2014\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Kira Jane</strong> is an independent fashion brand by designer Kira Smith.
