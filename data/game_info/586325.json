(Currently still in Beta)</p>\n<p>The second entry in this 'series' is a complete remake behind the scenes, not even one line of code from the first was reused as it was broken and messy. This version has much more content to play through with a cleaner UI and simpler gameplay with no more money system from the first which was more of an issue than good gameplay.</p>\n<p>I hope you check out and enjoy the second DogeCoin Clicker but I'd like to say it is still in a Beta state with more content and fixes planned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T04:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94f2294aa0582024b55c289d87c137cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alpha Key"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
