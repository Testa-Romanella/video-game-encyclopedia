Space bar restarts the game, and P pauses it.</p>\n<p>Objective:</p>\n<p>Get to the yellow ball in each of the four screens. If you collide with a red wall, you will die, and have to restart that screen. There is a timer at the top, because speedrunning (trying to beat the game as quickly as possible) is encouraged. The timer starts when you first extend your tongue.\u00a0You can write your times in the itch.io comments.\u00a0 Also, you have to make it full screen to see the timer for some reason.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Olivia Nobre Hauptmann: frog drawing.</p>\n<p>- Ib Nobre Hauptmann: everything else (exept the frog sounds, which I blatently stole from yoshi)</p>\n<p>I will probably add more stuff to the game, so feel free to critiuqe it in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T07:42:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/821c3819c6685f782cc93a184a83b1a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LardTheRard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
