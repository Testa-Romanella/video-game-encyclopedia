The starting ball drops through the doors from the sky and causes objects to collide continuously. I also created a rope using blender and integrating it into unity using hinge joints to make it flexible. I couldn't edit the path of the rope though. Even though the dominos are derived the prefab, they vary in weights so the last standing could cause the rope remove the ball holder on top of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:48:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92ead3ba850dd6b08f21b5ffbfc2488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["idleSoldier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
