{"id": 293797, "slug": "the-bane-of-ramses", "name": "The Bane of Ramses", "name_original": "The Bane of Ramses", "description": "<p>Made for the\u00a0TV Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Inspired by\u00a0Courage the Cowardly Dog, specifically the\u00a0King Ramses' Curse episode.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0You're in your house and a voice tells you to return all the pieces of the slab. You go to find these pieces but then the plagues come. You die, but you are given another chance. Will you be able to find them all?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features-</strong></p>\n<p>* Random plagues leaving unpredictable situations as you progress through the house in your search of the slab pieces.</p>\n<p>* Upgrades to help you survive easier and longer.</p>\n<p>* House that requires unlocking doors to progress through.</p>\n<p>* The pieces of the slab you must find will not always be in the same rooms, that along with the randomization of the plagues allows each run you do to be different than the last.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play-</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0You start out in the living room and need to purchase doors to access other parts of the house to find the slab pieces with the money that you get throughout the run for surviving. While you are doing this, the plagues will come and you will need to survive them and take advantage of your use of time and what room you are in when the plagues come because if you don't find the slab pieces before all the plagues are over, you lose. Also, you don't want to get stuck in certain rooms when the plague comes as you won't be able to leave until it's over and some rooms are a lot more cramped then others!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 In the beginning it will be hard as you need to develop your own strategies on how to survive each plague. After each run, you lose everything. However, you keep fragments of the slabs you got from the run, and you can use these fragments to purchase permanent upgrades to help you in future runs.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 If you're having trouble, remember to go to the shop to get some upgrades once you've gotten a couple fragments!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge-</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Beat everything? Reset your progress on the menu and try to get all 5 slabs with just the first money upgrade that gives you $10 instead of $5!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1.1</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added sounds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added your run time in the run over screen</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added more upgrades.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added a fullscreen option.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Changed the plague indication system.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added a clock to tell how long until a plague or how long the current one lasts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Fixed a sound bug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Fixed a collision bug.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1.11</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Added arrow key support.</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 I took inspiration from the whole show in general as all of the plagues you encounter are based off of antagonists in the show in numerous episodes, not just the King Ramses' Curse episode. I also tried to make the house in the game\u00a0like the house in the show by using\u00a0this video as reference.</p>\n\n<p>Written in Python using Pygame.</p>\n<p>All assets and code made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597fa125ca46006841da5ca60dfdb1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qooorti"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
