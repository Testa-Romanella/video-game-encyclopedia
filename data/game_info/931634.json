Larger ones require a <strong>bolas</strong> and the biggest ones even two. After catching an animal go to it and one of your sons will bring it to the ark. <strong>After sending all three you need to get back.</strong></p>\n<p>Combine different items you find to craft tools:<br/>fiber + fiber = rope<br/>rope + fiber = net<br/>rope\u00a0+ stone = bolas<br/>stone + wheat\u00a0= <strong>seeds</strong> (will spawn a bird you can catch)<br/><strong>carrot</strong> (use it to lure a rabbit)\u00a0</p>\n<p>When in the ark watch out for obstacles, as they will cause your animals to fall out. The same goes for sharks that you can fight off by throwing spears. You also have a <strong>hunger bar </strong>you can fill by catching fish at a site (appears as <strong>bubbles</strong>)</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam and first actually finished game ever. I was also working only for 4 days instead of 7 and I really am very proud of myself for making it. The bugs are unfortunate, but I am very happy with my work. Thank you for playing!!!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Music: BePM<br/>(besides the Final Fantasy theme used for meme purposes)</p>\n<p>Everything else: Me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T11:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c48745437483188bc357ab41f4d8160c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cymus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
