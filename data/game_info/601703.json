The bugs are as follows:<ul><li>Step A is skipped if the requirements for step B, interacting with &gt;10 other things,\u00a0are fulfilled beforehand.</li><li>Step B may also never complete.\u00a0This seems to happen\u00a0when the game is rushed through very quickly.\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>I really wanted to animate the paintings.\u00a0It would've been unique and probably rather pretty if there were background loops\u00a0(see\u00a0this oil painting GIF\u00a0that I'm heavily inspired by) and changes triggered by\u00a0interactions, for example closing and opening drawers, a moving clock hand, steam from the kettle, etc.\u00a0Unfortunately I\u00a0ran out of time.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Canvas texture by\u00a0powerpuffjazz\r\n</li><li>Font:\u00a0CMU Serif\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Last updated ~10:30pm 08/05/2020 AEST.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f49b7316d004e5f4fd2ecf3f7453703d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Corrade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
