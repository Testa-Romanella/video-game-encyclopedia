Just some simple ramp physics with you trying to get to three different platforms. I used a variety of gimmicks involving the friction, speed, bounce to make this level work. (The camera in this level was a pain, I can talk about it if you want just ask)</p>\n<p>2 - Wood marble maze. Reminds me of a simple marble maze with holes that the ball can fall through. I used a lot of next level code here to get the holes to put you right back to the start once you die.</p>\n<p>3 - Scary/Spooky maze. This maze is actually based on a Pokemon Game gym and it has the same exact layout as said gym. I worked a lot with the lighting here trying to make it as spooky as possible and making it extremely hard to see whats in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>In all, it was pretty fun and each level has increasing difficulty making the whole project very enjoyable to build. However, it is very difficult to do so hopefully you can win :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a82918ceb3d706f763ec0fa33a13aae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jbautista5435"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
