Put your mouse maneuvering skills to the test and pimp out your character along the way. During our creation of this project, we learned how to create shop systems</p>\n<p>// sorry y'all otter has no mf chill^^</p>\r\nStuff you probably don't care about:\r\n<p> We made this game in 3 days, so hopefully it isn't too buggy! We decided to challenge ourselves to make a game as fast as we could. Even though the game is simple, we worked hard on certain mechanics such as the shop and saving/loading a game. We had already done some of the saving/loading on Anticore, but only the high scores for each game mode. Please be kind, we are still very new to Gamemaker Studio, but constructive criticism is always welcome! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a27c176b608d369d467a549e9133c3d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Otter_and_Bench"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
