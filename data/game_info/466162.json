When the mark at the top reaches the green part of the bar the input is recorded, so you have to be pressing the arrow corresponding the direction needed (and only that one). When you get hit by Le Feroz after some good inputs, arrows will be swapped so you have to adapt to the new directions. It gets out of control very quickly.</p>\r\nWhat is this?!\r\n<p>This used to be a debate game. Then it was a flight simulator (but not a good one). Then it was a visual novel about a psychologists need for absolute control.</p>\n<p>Instead, this is a game where a boxer jellyfish called Jelly fights their lover,\u00a0 a crab called Le Feroz. For absolutely no reason. And when they finish they kiss. Because they're gay. And they love each other.
