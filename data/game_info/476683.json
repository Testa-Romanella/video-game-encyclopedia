{"id": 476683, "slug": "greedot", "name": "Greedot", "name_original": "Greedot", "description": "<p>Greedot is an open source clone of the linux game greed made in godot. I made it over the course of around 48 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greed is a puzzle game about numbers where your amount of moves is determined by the number in the direction you're moving.<br/>High scores are welcome!</p>\n\n<p>Greedot has every feature of the original greed terminal game!<br/></p>\n<p>Greedot also automatically resizes the playing field to the window size. Note that when you resize the window, it will restart your game.</p>\n<p>There is a download for windows, html, and the godot project.</p>\n<p>The font used in the game is White\u00a0Rabbit.</p>\n<p>Controls support controller movement but highlighting/restarting has to be done on the keyboard. Keyboard controls are:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys/Drag\u00a0- Movement</p>\n<p>R./Double Tap - Restart Greed</p>\n<p>P - Toggle Highlighting</p>\n<p>F - Toggle Fullscreen</p>\n\n<p>Note that I might not be the best programmer. These might not be the best practices. For example, the game gets very laggy when calling certain functions with lots of greed spaces. I've done a few things to help solve the lag issues, but it's still noticable. The game isn't really meant to be played at higher sizes either, as I feel it takes away some of the fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19fae83c8ec420b0c9ef2d4bb4cd6ff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kota"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
