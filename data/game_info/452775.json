You wake up in the Garden of Eden who's new home has been made in Limbo. You have three options: either take the trials to earn your place in Heaven, live it up in Hell, or remain lost in Limbo for eternity.</p>\n<p>It's a lot to take in fresh off your death bed... but maybe\u00a0 you find each other's peace along the way.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Repurpose is a LGBT+ positive dating sim about death, love, and finding your peace. You can play with she,he, or they pronouns to best suit your gender! The cast of REP are all in some capacity queer from their sexuality and/or gender!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0(keep in mind that that means in the case of\u00a0Rosita, a Lesbian, will interact more friendly than romantic when it comes to a male player. It is still possible to 100% the demo and the finale game if funded for he/him players no worries!)<br/></p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Character Art, Writing, Characters, Programming by ResidentRabbit<br/></p>\n<p>Backgrounds by TJ Lee</p>\n<p>A Cereus Garden Studios Production</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd478591cf96ddbe044a0e8553315ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eros"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
