The basic idea is that two players are initially provided with 50 bucks credit, which they will spend on betting. There are four horses each player can bet on. You can bet 5 to 30 bucks on a horse, if you hit the target the amount bet will double, elsewhere you lose it.\u00a0</p><p>Hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Send me your comments/suggestions at ilir.peposhi@fti.edu.al</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Ilir Peposhi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peposhi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
