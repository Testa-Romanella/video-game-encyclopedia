Either way, you take your skier and build them into a top Alpine athlete. Remember, though that behind every great athlete is a great manager and trainer, and this game makes no exception. The player must select a manager that suits their play style and abilities, likewise they must choose a trainer that will address the areas they need the most help in and create a training regime that will build the skills and abilities of their skier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e1d/e1d18d31a52d9e3f7557ab4f27d60292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["49Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
