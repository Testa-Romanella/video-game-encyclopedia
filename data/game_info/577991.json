Maybe next time I'll make something possible for me!\u00a0I hope you enjoy the idea regardless, and hey you can try out the map editor for fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 What's that blank button in the level select screen? - I don't know and it scares me.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 How do I quit the game? - Oh, I've forgotten to add a way to exit again... Alt+f4.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Aren't you just making these questions up because your game is shoddy? - Maybe...</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Why is everything slightly off? - Well, it wasn't until I built the game! Probably some wrong math in the code, sorry!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fe1c6ad8c4c229a651dd44d4d574a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vesper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
