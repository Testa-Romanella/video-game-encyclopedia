In \u201cTandem Masks\u201d you play as \u201cClimber\u201d in their quest to scale the great mountain for rewards and riches. Our team consists of a programmer, musician and artist with a spattering of assorted experience. This is a first jam for all of us and a first completed project for most of us so we are very much BEGINNERS. We learned a lot and shared work well as a team. We hope you enjoy our little game.\u00a0</li><li>For the theme of \u201cTWO\u201d we immediately thought of two worlds or two realms that the player could travel between. We wanted a mechanic that would let the player quickly switch between the real world and the spirit world. When the switch occurs the art, music and sprites all change to indicate which of the two worlds you are residing in. Since the timeline was so short we didn't have a ton of opportunity to build unique puzzles and encounters that take advantage of this mechanic but we hope you can see the idea and potential that we had in mind!</li></ol>\n\n<p>We all worked on the story, concept, level design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artist: https://twitter.com/seasaber</p>\n<p>Programing:\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/addisonnoxy</p>\n<p>Music/dialog:https://soundcloud.com/zephysounds</p>\n\n\n<p>Controls-</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>E to switch realms</p>\n<p>F To attack (not currently implemented)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb4680e57037c3cf9bb47e2437398753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zephysonas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
