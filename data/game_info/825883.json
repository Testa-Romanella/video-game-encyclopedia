For this game, we decided to try and create a rocket jump which the player could use to platform around \u2013 but at the cost of their health points. In order to stay alive and keep going, the player needs to collect Time Crack to replenish their health. This is also the goal of the game, turning it into a collect-o'-thon / FPS platformer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING PRE-MADE\u00a0ASSETS WERE USED IN UNREAL ENGINE 5:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Unreal Starter Content</li><li>Lowpoly Style Asia Environment</li><li>Low Poly Medieval Interior and Props</li><li>Royalty free images from Canva.com</li><li>Generic Rifle Cock by\u00a0GameWithBepis</li><li>Dark Cave Drone by Kinoton</li><li>Dark Cave Background 2 by SolarPhasing</li><li>Samurai \u262f Asian Japanese Music Lofi Hip Hop Mix</li><li>Garden Background by Fabrizio84</li><li>Sad Horror Music by TheoTer</li><li>Warrior Death Cry - British Male by theuncertainman</li><li>Asian Harmony by N0IZ</li><li>Sniffing, Short by InspectorJ</li><li>Human Sounds Sniff Sniffing by\u00a0deleted_user_7146007</li><li>male pain sound effects by rockittt</li></ul>\n\n<p>For an optimal experience, play with sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T08:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de5a2fadadab511da4adb117eda6a1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GusGas"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
