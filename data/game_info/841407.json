Play as a Geno, one of little less than 0.5% percent of the population that has gone through a mysterious process called Claremont-Simonson mutation, as you try to navigate a world that won\u2019t make room for you. Exceptionals is a game about what the mutant metaphor means to you\u00a0and the different lenses through which we view it. Punch back and build something of worth together in this narrative tag-driven tabletop role playing game.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>Open-Ended Character Creation</strong>\n<br/>\r\nMix and Match between (23) open-ended but guided protocols. Answer questions to create high concept and unique super powered characters where the only real limit is your imagination. Get invested in who you make as a whole person, and not just a set of powers.\r\n</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Build a Community</strong>\n<br/>\r\nCreate a living and dynamic community space full of colorful characters. Grow your base as an anchor for other geno and help fill it with the resources they and you need. Understand how your actions effect others and gain trust through the bonds mechanic. It\u2019s a game where you get stronger by growing your community and heal by being part of it.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Comic Book Storytelling</strong>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as a creative team of writers and editors working to tell the best version of the story you can over time and storyline-based experience to model changes of the status quo and creative direction. Enjoy panel based action pacing and the ability of characters of all power levels to coexist and carry the same amount of story weight.\r\n</li><li><strong>\u00a0Not Pain Tourism</strong>\n<br/>\r\nWhile Exceptionals offers a number of places to push back, we understand and recognize that the most important part of a punching bag is that you choose to hit it, even if it\u2019s not at all. We recognize not everyone gets to set the issues that the mutant metaphor is used to talk about down when they leave the table and offer many ways to tell stories outside of a lens defined by pain. We also put an emphasis and mechanical weight on the importance of joy and celebration.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\u00a0Welcome To Reedsboro\r\n\r\nLife in Reedsboro is no vacation...\r\n<p>Situated in the Outer Banks, Reedsboro is a tourist town that caters to a set of people that are only\u00a0there for 3 to 6 months of the year but can\u2019t decide whether it wants to be a summertime paradise for\u00a0families and surfers or a historic get-away full of colonial and pirate history. Build community in the rural south and combat the tools used to divide and conquer Southern oppressed communities such as rural isolation, Right-wing Christian infrastructure, racism, environmental degradation, and economic oppression. On top of your normal strange and wild comic book threats.\r\n</p>\n<p>Welcome To Reedsboro is a toolbox for any Exceptionals game, filled with things to make getting a game up and running that much easier.
