{"id": 746308, "slug": "a-poets-dilemma", "name": "A Poet's Dilemma", "name_original": "A Poet's Dilemma", "description": "<p>A Poet's Dilemma\u00a0</p>\n<p>A single player game where the player is in search of the character's decorative hat feather, which was taken away in a gust of wind while sitting on the edge of a cliff, looking for inspiration. It turns out that the recovery of the hat isn't that easy of a task and the player finds himself to encounter unexpected challenges. Due to time constraints, we weren't able to integrate the full storyline in the game, the part where this would have been a \"it's not real\" game would have been at the end, when the player recovers ared hat rather than a blue one. In the initial levels the player would be looking for a BLUE hat, but as they would have progressed through the levels, the NPC's would have told the player that there is only a RED hat. Ultimately, the player would have started looking for a RED hat, rather than a BLUE one. This was a scheme inspired by the Mandela effect, when something is so similar that people can't tell which is the truth, even if they have seen the object plenty of times before. The player needs to progress through the levels and avoid the obstacles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player has 100 HP points, the HP drops by the amount of time the player stays in a warp portal. So it's not set as a fixed value, but more in the lines of AOE. When the player reaches 0 points, a game over screen will appear.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>+ Bogdan Golea - Student in year 2 at Glasgow Caledonian University - Game Design<br/>+ Quincy van der Sluis (Qwinsie) - Student in year 3 at Applied Sciences University Rotterdam - Creative Media &amp; Game Technologie<br/></p>\n<p>+ Hannes (Aiceplays)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c25e4ca55cd8e24256b8e748fa818923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qwinsie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
