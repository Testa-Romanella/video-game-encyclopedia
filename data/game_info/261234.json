{"id": 261234, "slug": "year-in-the-trees", "name": "Year In The Trees", "name_original": "Year In The Trees", "description": "<p>Year In The Trees is a pixel art survival RPG about beginning a new life in an enchanted forest filled with secrets. The game features a blend of hand-authored and procedural content so that it feels familiar each time you return, but random enough that no two character&#39;s stories are ever the same. Travel deep into the heart of nature and learn to survive on your own while unearthing the forgotten history of this place. </p>\n<p>Gather resources to craft new items by farming, trading, exploring, or fighting. Each item you make has a chance to unlock new recipes through the game&#39;s discovery system. As you expand your capabilities and wealth, you&#39;ll be able to recover powerful items and hidden lore from the furthest reaches of the forest. </p>\n<p>Death is permanent, but items and upgrades can be passed down to future characters. You might decide to play as a farmer this run in order to stockpile provisions for your next character. </p>\n<p>Although there are many familiar places, the game&#39;s randomly-generated levels and items will shape your strategy in unexpected ways. Unlocking a rare armor recipe early in the game may entice you to become a blacksmith, whereas learning that a unique artifact weapon is for sale in a nearby shop might lead you to play more like a trader or merchant. </p>\n<p>Ultimately it&#39;s up to you, but choose carefully: your time in these woods is limited. Each play-style will encounter different lore, but learning the true story of the forest could be the work of generations...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a72/a72e6c4018e2da3f824279bc078ba4c3.jpg", "website": "https://www.yearinthetrees.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lunoland"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
