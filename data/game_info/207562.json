{"id": 207562, "slug": "gang-ko", "name": "Gang KO", "name_original": "Gang KO", "description": "<p>Game Trailer: Here</p>\n<p><em>Gang KO</em> is an old-school style brawler where the player battles their way through an urban city full of rival gangsters. Players can dodge both enemy attacks and stage hazards, as they work their way to the boss of the gang. The game features a pixelated, bouncy art style that is reminiscent of <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,</em> both the game and the graphic novel. Players are able to perform combos on enemies and progress through each stage by overpowering them.<br/></p>\n<p>Our game takes inspiration from <em>River City Ransom</em> and <em>Urban Champion</em>, specifically in its theme of urban combat and one-on-one battle gameplay. We picked the urban theme as a callback to the city-focused media of the 80s and 90s. Each of us here on the Gang KO team want to create a game where players can feel empowered through their actions. Whether that\u2019s through beating up foes or skillfully dodging obstacles we believe that our game will deliver our experience to our players. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35bd45387210a157932c62212f2a6241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jessica M.", "kevinkrause217"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
