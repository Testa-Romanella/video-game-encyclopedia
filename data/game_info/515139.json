Facing defining life moments and trying out different colors \u2013 that is to say attributes \u2013 as reactions helps the player figure out what kind of person they are. The Painting in the initial room represents this journey, being completed as the player progresses and accompanies the protagonist through their life. The unusual passing of time in the game is illustrated by daylight coming into each room through a window. They appear to be visited at dawn, noon and dusk, respectively which are established imagery for the periods of a human's life. Choices that fall in line with the players assigned attribute make for a clear image in the final artwork, as the protagonist gains a clear understanding of who they are, while disharmonious choices have the opposite effect and make for a more smeared painting.<br/>The abstract setting and atmosphere of the game coupled with the lack of guidance or explanation the player receives make for a mysterious and confusing journey, much like the actual path to self-discovery.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Download Log</strong></p>\n<ul><li>08.07.2019 - Build 1.0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f930908f37d70cf478b311221c1af58b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BelaB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
