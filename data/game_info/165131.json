A momentum based game, the player has two actions - one action pulls them towards an object they\u2019re facing (Grapple), whereas the other pushes them away from the direction they\u2019re facing while destroying destructible objects in front of them (Push Off). Landing these moves in succession will build a combo increasing the potency of each, and using the same move more than once will break the combo, bringing the player back down to base potency/combo. \u00a0Players will be awarded points based off of destruction and completion time.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Desiree Makowski</p>\n<p>Tom Crammond</p>\n<p>Josh Burgenger</p>\n<p>Steven Vaccari</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/957d980bde5286bbe195bb2b56d0e597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
