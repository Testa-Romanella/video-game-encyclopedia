Get ready to fight the largest tank battle in Imperial history with more tanks and more destruction than ever!<br/><br/>After the virus bombing by the traitorous Iron Warriors rendered the surface of Tallarn deadly to biological life, the besieged forces call upon legions of tanks - from the Leman Russ to the almighty Baneblade to bring war to their enemy.
