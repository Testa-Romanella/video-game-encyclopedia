{"id": 24183, "slug": "pixlcross", "name": "PixlCross", "name_original": "PixlCross", "description": "<p>\n      PixlCross is a nonogram puzzle game (eg Picross) where you use hints to \n      fill in a grid and reveal a hidden image. With 150+ puzzles and 4 levels \n      of difficulty, there's a diverse array of content with puzzles spanning \n      from 5x5 to 35x35.\n    </p><p>\n      But don't worry, you won't have to solve the big ones all in one go. \n      PixlCross saves each move and allows you to jump back in whenever you \n      want. If you ever get stuck, the hint system can get you back on your \n      way.\n    </p><p>\n      The Wii U\u2122 GamePad makes puzzle solving intuitive: simply touch and \n      slide along the grid to fill in and cross out boxes. Pop-out hints, \n      boxes that count as you fill and auto-scroll make it even easier to \n      tackle the toughest of puzzles.\n    </p><p>\n      At any time you can hop over to the Puzzle Editor and begin creating \n      puzzles of your own! With the power to detect ambiguities, you can \n      create puzzles that can be solved without guessing. If creating isn't \n      for you, just search for puzzles or enter puzzle IDs found on \n      Miiverse\u2122/social media to keep on playing!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e237beb96e1af3b5c78276a8c7719992.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixlbitstudios.com/pixlcross", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["PixlBit Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["PixlBit Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
