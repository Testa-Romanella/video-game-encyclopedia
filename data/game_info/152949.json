The code is free to be used for any project you wish provided you purchased this package. Also there is only one screenshot of the screen because i can't really show much else except the code and if i showed that then obviously there would be no point in selling this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e51440505ee2dcd3c2e2d15df5c2ac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PinkysSoft.Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
