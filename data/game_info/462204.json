{"id": 462204, "slug": "origin-hunt", "name": "Origin Hunt", "name_original": "Origin Hunt", "description": "<p>For over 500 years the country of Lenma has known relative peace as a result of the truce with their Origin Mages.<br/>Masters of their elements, Origin Mages are responsible for keeping their monsters away from human populations. In this, the country maintains stability.<br/>But no system is perfect. Now the repercussions of a tragic event years ago are here as one individual begins a final and bloody quest for justice.</p>\n<p><em>Origin Hunt</em>\u00a0is a story-and-character driven game where choices made have lasting impact. Turn-based combat provides challenge with a multitude of custom player and enemy skills. Utilize an element system and manipulate enemy passives to strategize victory.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Turn-based combat with animated enemies and action sequences.</li><li>All enemies have custom skills; some have custom passives. Stronger enemies and bosses have AI for a dynamic challenge.</li><li>A crafting system -\u00a0 that doesn't require hours of resource collecting! You can battle for items, gather them in the world, or just buy them from a local merchant.</li><li>Skill learn system: learn what skills and passives you want when you want them. You can then upgrade those skills to more powerful versions - and then into branching versions, so pick which bonus you want for that skill carefully!</li><li>Achievements, for the completionist inside all of us.</li><li>Day/Night Cycle with in-game effects! From skill bonuses to events to the poor guy wearing sunglasses at night.</li><li>Choices that matter. Choose how to act to your team, and to the general populations. How you interact with others can change how they act towards you! [Ultimately, this includes unlocking special content and areas, but that is not available until after the point in the game where the demo ends. Sorry!]</li><li>Gear customization. Can't get enough of ridiculous, complex, over-the-top equipment names?</li></ul>\n\n<p>you'll find plenty of that with random gear traits and equippable augments!</p>\n<ul><li>Character Combat Customization: No character is locked into a role. Build your team how you want. Want your healer to become a damage-dealer? Great! Need more magical offense power? Why not take your physical character and turn them into a mage? All of this without classes; strategic use of skills and equipment give team-building freedom.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>~~Hey, you made it here?\u00a0Awesome!
