(Character Development? What's that?)</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>soundtrack</strong> that\u00a0sounds like it was made by a <strong>monkey with a\u00a0synthesizer</strong>!</li><li><strong>Black-And-Mostly-White graphics</strong> made in a vector graphics program!</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>story</strong> written on the spot with nearly no preparation or thought put into it!</li><li>Lame <strong>4th-wall breaks and references</strong> everywhere!</li><li><strong>Featuring the default GUI of the Ren'Py engine!</strong></li><li><strong>Only 3-4 decisions</strong> <strong>in the whole game</strong> that don't have absolutely any effect on the ending!</li><li><strong>It even has scrolling credits at the end!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Are you ready for the most generic and boring game\u00a0of your life?</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated, as it will help me when I eventually decide to make a decent game :D</p>\n<p>(The Web version has problems with the music. It's recommended to download the executable.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84f/84fdbcf64fdd85504b4695efb63ab461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RealcielO5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
