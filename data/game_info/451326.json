Ohio, a small street home to a few people. You play as a character who has gotten himself into and... interesting... situation.</p>\n<p>Every day seems very similar, without much change. Your goal is to play, and see what happens as you go through. Now, although this game is endless, every three days... something... happens. It's like an ending, but also kind of isn't. Play it yourself to see what I mean!</p>\n<p>This game includes...</p>\n<ul><li>3 ending-like events</li><li>A whole large set of 6 entire character, all with at least one piece of dialogue!</li><li>Sarcasm aside, this game does have a few various choices you can make each day, each one affecting your day-three event.</li><li>A small semi-hidden life message I figured I'd chuck in, because, you know, I thinks it's good advice.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>A and D: Walk left and right respectively</li><li>E: Interact with objects with an E below them</li><li>Y and N: When a text box ends with \"Y/N\", you can press these to reply with \"Yes\" or \"No\" respectively</li></ul>\n<p>Note for everyone: PLEASE give the most honest feedback you have. I'm currently an aspiring game dev, and I'm trying to improve my skills. Again, feedback is highly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a83/a831c2433efc85c374291e3f5c976ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ProShinyScarab"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
