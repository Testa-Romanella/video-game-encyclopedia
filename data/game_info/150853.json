Dislcaimer: your brain may be tied into a knot while trying to figure out how to play this.</p><p>Use arrows and Z and X to whack'em on the head.\u00a0Without pressing Z and X, the arrows will attack the topmost holes. Holding down Z will shift the focus to the leftmost set of holes, now the arrows will hit this set. Holding X will shift to the rightmost set of holes. And how to reach the bottom set of holes? Yup, your worst fears are correct. Pressing both X and Z simultaneously will shift the focus to the bottom set of holes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made in a couple of days in Pico-8 and it will not receive any more updates. It's a finished project.\u00a0</p><p>If you beat my record I want to see it! Right now my record is level 70 (see screenshot, which I took from the Pico-8 game page). And no messing with the source code to\u00a0cheat! You won't get away with it because\u00a0I will know! (I will most definitely not know and you will get away with it)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6cf27e4ce91d7b1b19c318b92e1a440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["diegzumillo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
