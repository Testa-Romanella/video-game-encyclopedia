It's coded in C++, uses SDL2 to handle low-level stuff and OpenGL as renderer system. The game is inspired by Tempest, an Atari arcade classic designed by Dave Theurer and released on October 1981.</strong></p><p><strong>The game has various arcade elements, such as hiscore table and difficulty increased by time. The idea is to test the player skill, so no powerups are implemented.</strong></p><p><strong>You play the game by moving the square-shaped ship with LEFT-RIGHT arrow keys and shoot lasers with SPACEBAR. You have to destroy the great enemy spaceship on far of the screen to advance through levels.</strong></p><p><strong>The game has a simple plot described as follows: mankind discovered the core of the universe, the source of all energy, but an alien race is fighting to conquer it for evil purposes. You are the most skilled pilot and you were disgned to fight the evil aliens to take the core of the universe.</strong></p><p><strong>I hope you enjoy Syderal_Kombat!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a759eb5f804443be725b489e7b56b112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeizerZilla"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
