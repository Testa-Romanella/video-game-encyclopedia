You have been fighting in the time wars for some time and succeeded. Since your last battle, you find yourself to be in another time war. The big question is, are you fighting a war on an island against militants... or are you battling against the aliens?<br/><br/>Fight your way through 4 zones against the army/alien forces. Use the green laser circles to divide yourself into\u00a0 identical versions of yourself (if you have the energy to that). If one of yourself is hit by bullets or deadly lasers. That version of yourself will lose a life. The game will end when both versions of your identical self lose all your lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Can Joe Rubicon win the time wars once again, or will fate hang in the balance?</p>\n<p><strong>Control:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Joystick in Port 2<br/>RUN/STOP (escape key) - Pause game<br/>Q (Paused) - Abort game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Game design, graphics by <strong>Alf Yngve</strong> (Created using the Shoot Em Up Construction Kit)<br/>SEUCK Redux framework by <strong>Martin Piper<br/></strong>Additional programming, enhancements and music by <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Loading bitmap by <strong>Errazking<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>(C)2017-2020+ Alf Yngve and The New</strong> <strong>Dimension</strong></p>\n<p>This game is freeware\u00a0.
