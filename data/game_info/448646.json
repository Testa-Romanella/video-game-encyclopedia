{"id": 448646, "slug": "one-shot-10", "name": "One Shot 1.0", "name_original": "One Shot 1.0", "description": "<p>One Shot\u00a0is a splitscreen game about shooting the other player with fireballs in order to kill them. You do this in different arenas, each unique. There are also enemies to distract you from the other player and they can kill you too.\u00a0 A dark red zone also slowly shrinks to limit the playing space over time.\u00a0This game lets you customize most of the stats for the players and environment, such as health, ammo, reload speed, and more. 3 months in the making, this is One Shot.
