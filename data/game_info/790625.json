This was our stepping stone in game development and team management work.<br/><br/> The idea of the game was to fit the brief of a game that portrays the university in a positive light.\u00a0The premise of \u2018Dead Inside\u2019 has the university (GCU) under the attack of \u2018zombified\u2019 students, symbolizing the stereotype of how students act (sleep-deprived, slow, lazy, etc.). The game\u2019s map displays a simplified version of the campus with the central point being the Govan Mbeki building, which is the point that the player needs to defend, hence referencing the university within the game.</p>\n<p>The design of the characters is also based on stereotypes, e.g. emo, hipster, etc. The university\u2019s buildings act as turrets, being placed in designated areas to defend the center of the map. The turret's art style for each building relates to the building and/or the history of the person it is named after, again directly referencing the university and educating people about the buildings to some extent.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea of the game is to promote and educate people about the university\u2019s campus, for example, if the player places the turrets (university buildings) relative to how the campus is laid out in real life, the player earns bonuses such as improved range, speed, etc.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256383caaea14c2955e0d67f45087f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
