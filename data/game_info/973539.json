As word of his death echoes throughout the kingdom, the crown passes to his arrogant, yet untested son Magnus.</p>\n<p>Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything and everyone it touches. Madrigal Seline, a ruthlessly ambitious figure in the church, sees the Pestilence as a chance to prove herself in the eyes of her god.</p>\n<p>These forces converge on the backwater Isola Sacra, where rebel groups and the provincial government fight for control amid the isle\u2019s crumbling ruins.</p>\n<p>You are a Cerim \u2013 a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the people\u2019s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land.
