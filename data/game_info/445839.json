They saw that Earth was very different from how it looked in the past. Specifically, Earth was filled with creatures like \u2018Humans. Scared that Mother-Snake would be angry at them for not taking care of Earth, the Gods decide they need to eradicate all of life on Earth. However, the Gods were also scared to go to Earth, since if it were to hatch they may die. The Gods decided to send their children to Earth on their behalf to kill all life on Earth. When the children of the Gods started attacking Humans, the Humans started calling them \u2018MoonMen\u2019. \"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>MOONMAN TEAM:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jack Rodr\u00edguez | Programmer | Character Design | Artist |</strong></p>\n<p>emaildejack@gmail.com / @ordinary_ram</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Ethan Tocci | Artist | Programmer |</strong></p>\n<p>etocciano@gmail.com</p>\n<p><strong>Sam Goldblatt | Musician | Artist | Writer | Film Editor |</strong></p>\n<p>samgoldblatt.anim@gmail.com</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Arham Hossain | Writer | Creature Design | Artist | Programmer |</strong></p>\n<p>arhamhossain11@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fa2dd4455a968b6ab512730681f3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AttackoftheMoonMan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
