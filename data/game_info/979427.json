Booey needs your help to clean everything up and send it home. Can <strong>you</strong> bring order to the chaos?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Discover <strong>over 150</strong> unique things to possess and control! Balls roll, ducks waddle, planes fly, and toast... toasts?<br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>For Clinicians, Teachers, and Parents</h3>Booeys: Rip in the Rift was built to supplement VB-MAPP assessments and curriculum in a fun and engaging format and provides countless levels of customization to support individualized instruction. <br/><br/><strong>Easy to get started; powerful enough for professional use!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>The <strong>Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP)</strong> was designed by Dr. Mark Sundberg as a criterion referenced assessment curriculum guide, and skill tracking system. Based on the theory of verbal behavior, the VB-MAPP is an evidenced based assessment commonly used for early learners with language delays and autism spectrum disorder.<br/><br/><strong>Booeys: Rip in the Rift</strong> seamlessly integrates with your curriculum, aligning with educational standards and VB-MAPP goals for visual perception and matching skills. Students sort objects based on various criteria, mirroring activities you already use in the classroom. This game effectively supports:<br/><br/><ul><li>Early learners: Identify identical objects (fruits, shapes) like Kindergarten standards.<br/></li><li>Developing learners: Group similar items (colors, categories) like Grade 1-2 expectations.<br/></li><li>Advanced students: Find variations within categories (textures, patterns) like Grade 3 and above challenges.</li></ul><br/>Booeys engages the player with embedded visual prompts subtly guiding players, mimicking therapist instructions, and \u201cexplosive\u201d scenes when matching correctly. As children play, Booeys tracks their progress. See accuracy rates, submitted items, and active input time, gaining valuable insights into their development. This data can be shared with clinicians, educators, and parents to guide further learning and interventions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T08:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc5/cc543698afdc49581e2d6f9a70dd8780.jpg", "website": "https://www.simcoachgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simcoach Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Simcoach Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
