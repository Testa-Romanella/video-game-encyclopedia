The Singing Tower is a first person exploration game where you play as a gallant prince on his way to rescue Rapunzel from her imprisonment in the tower. Inspired by the Grimm Brother's famous fairy tale, enter the world of the evil witch Madam Gothel as you try and save your beloved. Can you sneak the bird from the nest before her evil mother discovers you?</p><p>The Singing Tower was a solo project I took part in during my final semester at RMIT. The focus behind this solo project was to develop and explore the full extent of my learning over the course of my 2 degrees. The game is intended to be a 3D environment piece rather than a game in the traditional sense of the word. Enjoy exploring and investigating the world I've created!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82b33e0bab01df4f66d31276e73a2e03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kittens Place"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
