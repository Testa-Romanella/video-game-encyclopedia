A Western theme, with an Always Faster element, with a Future zone (history repeats... Kinda). I ended up not utilizing Gravity other than jumping, so that isn't featured. Overall this has been a positive run. 14/10 would do it again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a7507b3070af9c98d22f1e46d2e00bf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["DevlynJD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
