Or actually read/watched tons of them?</p>\n<p>Well, here's another one :)</p>\n<p>This time, in VN form, with quite a bit of genre parody and self-irony in it.</p>\n<p>The protagonist is called Alex, a poor sap of a stereotypical nerd (not at all based on the author...), and gets thrown into a typical Isekai fantasy world... without any visible power-ups or special abilities whatsoever. In a world full of dangers (including some easily-angered girls with very poor aggression management), Alex must navigate the dangers of \"one stupid comment could get you killed\" and somehow reach the (preliminary) end of this Visual Novel alive.</p>\n<p>Summoned by three girls to serve as their tactician/commander/leader to improve their in-battle performance, Alex needs to overcome his own weaknesses to live up to their expectations.</p>\n<p>Will he fail, or is there actually more to him than meets the eye?</p>\n<p>Download and find out!<br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Over 10.000 words (NaNoRenO 22 version), well over 90% of them in dialogues</li><li>6 characters (male MC, 4 female heroines, and...)</li><li>humor/comedy-focused, but not completely without serious scenes</li><li>kinetic/linear plot, but a few choices along the path, many of which lead to gruesome-yet-funny(?)

Sounds worse than it is, I think.</li></ul>\n<p>What you should expect in terms of graphic-ness:</p>\n<ul><li>Some blood, but only as blood-only screens, no blood or gore visible on characters themselves</li><li>No nudity or otherwise sexual graphics, unless you absolutely want to count one characters' armpits...</li></ul>\n<p>Also, no problematic sound effects.<br/></p>\n<p>tl;dr: SFW in my book, but at least 13+ recommended due to language and Dead Ends<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T19:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17fe71c6f0b1af931c971e2fbe2c312d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["OnionCuttingNinja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
