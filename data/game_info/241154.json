Various objects consistently drop out from the test tube connected to the bioreactor. You must take them and place them on the playing field. When three same objects (or two same and one special) are side by side, they evolve into a more advanced form! This is repeated several times until you get the most perfect zombies. Place the objects strategically: if there are no free cells on the field, you lose, because the zombies violate the conditions of their existence and will break out uncontrollably, cause it's too crowded in your laboratory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the name of chaos! <br/>\r\nWe remind you that in this game you are a mad scientist who wants to plunge the world into chaos! Doesn't it remind anyone? In any case, when you get the most advanced zombies, they go to the big world to wreak havoc in one of the four areas of human life. As your minions progress, the chaos scales will fill up. Note that if one of the scales exceeds others by 30%, the society will notice that something is going wrong and you will be discovered. So try to keep balance. As soon as all the chaos scales are filled, you win! However, you can continue the game even after this significant moment!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bda0d83ba246a5679aaa2cbe1e3bbaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GameChain"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["GameChain"], "esrb_rating": null}
