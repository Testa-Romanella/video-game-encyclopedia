I joined the Game Dev party quite late in life and got my first glimpse of Unity almost exactly 2 years before making the first demo of World Turtles, my very first game, available. I'm amazed at the progress I\u2019d been able to make during these two years and owe a great deal of gratitude to various tutorial channels, plug-ins and artists whom I leaned on during the development. None more than Catlike Coding, whose brilliant Hex Map tutorial series kickstarted this entire endeavour.</p>\n<p>I would love to develop World Turtles further alongside a group of enthusiastic real-world Meeps.</p>\n<p><strong>Please, join me and be a part of the journey!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf9e00fa972822fddf4fe5d294b78cf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Re cOg Mission"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
