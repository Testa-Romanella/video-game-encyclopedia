Except it's not you doing the crawling, it's a purple blob. What you have to do is strategically place the given enemies and items to ensure the blob stays alive!</p>\n<p>The game is currently heavily unpolished (it reached \"technically playable\" status 6 hours before the deadline), but will receive some love afterwards because we like the concept.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Change map size if you like (over 10x10 is not recommended) and click play.</p>\n<p>You'll be presented with a fully revealed dungeon you can explore, and on your right a deck of \"cards\", of which you see the top five by default. With each click, you'll have to place the top card onto a slot of the proper type. Here are the color codes used:</p>\n<p>- Yellow, orange, red: progressively harder enemies<br/>- Green, blue, purple: progressively better loot</p>\n<p>Once every card has been placed, you'll watch your purple blob try to make its way to the boss room, hopefully with<br/>good results!</p>\r\nPost-jam content\r\n<p>- Gold dropped by enemies can be spent on blob upgrades<br/>- Items looted from boss room upgrade your experience as a Dungeon Furnisher</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Wall &amp; floor textures, as well as several item ideas, are by M4n1us,<br/>and music by\u00a0MrDetonia - all made during the event.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:42:21", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zeroji"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
