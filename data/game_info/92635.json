(itch)", "description": "<p>Settle an argument or make friends by challenging them in a cute and simple arcade game!<br/></p><p><strong>Head It!</strong> is an art project/game I worked on from September 2016 - December 2016 for my Senior Exhibition. </p><p><strong>This game does NOT have a single player mode</strong>, so you HAVE to find friends or enemies. People usually end up being one or the other. </p><p><strong>It should be played on a </strong><strong>single computer with both players sharing the local keyboard. (WASD for Player 1 and Arrow Keys for Player 2.) Each game is only 60 seconds, which is perfect for quick rematches or Round-Robin style elimination at parties.</strong><br/>You can toggle the conversation prompts on and off by pushing S or Down key, and the Tutorial can be toggled by pushing T. </p><p>This game is completely free, and all I ask is that you do not claim it as your own or directly monetize off of it (selling related merch, selling the game, etc) because that's uncool. YouTube LPs are fine! If you had fun playing it, show me/let me know!</p><p>Art and Design by Sam Luangkhot (me!)<br/>twitter<br/>portfolio</p><p>James Hostetler<br/>Programmer<br/>twitter<br/>portfolio<br/>itch.io</p><p>Timothy Adan<br/>Composer / SFX<br/>twitter<br/>portfolio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/241bb6637ee5bebf94663f4932158794.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sam Luangkhot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
