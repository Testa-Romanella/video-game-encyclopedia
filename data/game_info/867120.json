You, the player, are a neon ball that is rolling on an endless pipe trying to dodge the obstacles that appear along the way by rotating the pipe. The core mechanic that distinguishes Neon Orbit from others is the limitations on the rotation in given situations. When a Red obstacle appears in front of the player the player can only perform left rotation, when a Blue obstacle appears in front of the player the player can only perform right rotation and finally when a Yellow obstacle appears in front of the player the player can rotate the pipe both ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T12:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efc10efdee2f3041643615295b4d5b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BulletproofCupid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
