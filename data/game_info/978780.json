Suddenly, out of the ground a skeleton digs its way up. More Skeletons follow, till a whole horde comes up. There is no way to run or hide. All you can do is survive as long as possible till death inevitably puts an end to your struggles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou play a Rifleman and fight in an endless Wave survival. The enemies are skeletons. Your Health bar wont regenerate, so you need to watch out for every hit. The Waves build up progressively, in wave 1 there is 1 unit, in wave 2 there are 2 units, and so on and so forth. So the first few waves gonna be easy, but by wave 10 its starting to get tricky. If your health bar goes to zero, you start by wave 1 again with full health. The Wave that you are currently playing is your score, the higher the wave the higher is you score. The game has a retro look, where you play on a grass field and fight skeletons. If you defeat all enemies the next wave will spawn immediately, there is no time pressure, the next wave will spawn only after you finished the current wave.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnits:<br/>\r\n- Skeleton Mage: makes ranged attacks that you need to dodge, moves in random directions. Shoots fireballs.<br/>\r\n- Skeleton Warrior: attacks you if you get to close, moves in random directions.<br/>\r\n- Skeleton Elite: will chase after you, makes a lot of damage if he is in range and takes a lot of hits to defeat.<br/>\r\n- Skeleton Dog: is the fastest unit in the game and also the most annoying. Will chase after you and takes a few hits to defeat. You are forced to run away from the skeleton dogs and try to hit them while you run.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Keyboard Controls are displayed in the Game Menu.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Infinite Waves to play.<br/>\r\n- Difficulty gets progressively more difficulty with every wave.<br/>\r\n- No Health regeneration.<br/>\r\n- Ranged attacks with a bullet.<br/>\r\n- Animated Units.<br/>\r\n- Supports Mouse and Keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nversion 1.0", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T08:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b4/0b43c7b3ea6d13d35de2d59b4961af79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cube Works Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Cube Works Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
