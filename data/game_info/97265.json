Your goal is to get and keep the ball as long as possible, in a small arena.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tGame made for LowRezJam 2016, by Uubu, Paws Menu and Louck (me).</p>\n<p>We will be very happy if you can leave a comment about our project. Your feedback is very important, and we need it for the realization of the next version of our game :).<br/></p>\n<p>But more importantly, have fun!</p>\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY!\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe game can be played with a keyboard or/and controllers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Actions</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you are a \r\n\t<strong>player</strong>:\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>A - Dash! </strong>To move quickly and to push (and stun) your opponents. Pressed a second time - at the right moment - you can make a second Dash! But the recovery will be hard. <br/>\n<strong>B - Block!</strong> To counter Dash or to catch hard ball.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you are the \r\n\t<strong>carrier </strong>- the one with the ball:\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>A - Throw! </strong>To throw the ball in your direction at high speed. You can stun your opponent in that way.\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>B - Curved pass!</strong> To pass the ball to your friend, in a easy way.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are many ways to catch the ball. The most common one is to Dash on the carrier. Or you can \r\n\t<strong>follow and hang on to the player</strong>, to slow him and to steal his ball... if he doesn't escape!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you want to use the keyboard, there are two possible configuration (two players can play this game with the same keyboard):\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Configuration one</strong><br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tMovement - W A S D (or Z Q S D)\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tA button - Space\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tB button - Left Shift\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Configuration two</strong><br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tMovement - Arrow keys\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tA button - Right Shift or Enter\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\tB button - Left Ctrl or Alt Gr</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\tHave fun :).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14bbf06b3348569911d6bc2ec218268b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PunxelTeam", "louck"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
