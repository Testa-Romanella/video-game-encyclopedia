I also wrote a simple tile editor to let me create backgrounds and tile maps and the like (also in Zig, also not very good). \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>I was not able to satisfactorily finish the game. I wanted to add in multiplayer support but kept running into issues with the program counter going out of bounds when compiling. I cannot say for sure if this is a Zig issue or a me issue, probably the latter as I have limited experience. The sounds are also really bare bones, which is disappointing. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/><br/>Regardless, this is gnoq, it's like the classic game pong that we all know and love except the classic level boundaries shift around meaning the ball doesn't behave at all how you might predict it will. The game is a simple first to 9 wins experience against a rudimentary computer opponent. I have tested that it runs on a GBA device using a flash cart and also the mGBA emulator.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun, I am glad I entered into this competition and saw it through to the end. I have learned a lot about GBA and Zig.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec8/ec826f21dae04bd1322c3c5999ec8f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bergasms"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
