You can fire lasers that are capable of neutralizing both the enemy robots and their lasers.\u00a0</li><li>The Minotaur will charge toward the nearest enemy. He will only stop or\u00a0change course once his current target is dead. If he hits into his target, it will instantly be destroyed, and he will take a small amount of damage.</li><li>Each enemy killed (by the turret or the Minotaur) will add 1 to the player's current score.
