When all the mochi are eaten, the round ends and the scores are shown. Best of 5 rounds wins the game!</p>\n<p>Scoring is as follows:</p>\n<p>2pts if you successfully grab a mochi during the decision portion.</p>\n<p>1pt for any leftovers.</p>\n<p>Controls for each player and a recap of the rules can be found in the last slide of the \"How\u00a0To\u00a0Play\" section of the menu.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to James Palermo(\u00a0@JamesisAsian) for cranking out the art assets and helping design this thing, Nick Kornek (@nkornek) for introducing me to this wonderful jam and providing moral support throughout the weeks, and lastly\u00a0Aaron San Filippo (@AeornFlippout) for some critical last minute bug solving minutes before I finished the game. \u00a0Looking forward to this week's Showcase!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e592c5f0e494b67cd56e4704def7b44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Terry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
