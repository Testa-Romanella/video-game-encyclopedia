The emerge mechanic is the newest system available which takes a bit more storage than previous games. The flashlight feature is a bit off and make sure your mouse cursor is what you're using to flash.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                           ~SPECIAL NIGHTS~\r\n<p>The special nights is a new feature which incudes 2 more nights which are optional.

Activating the cheats will display a mini-map in game showing players the location of entertainers. Once cheats have been enabled the player will not unlock scrapbook achievements, ending cutscene,  extras menu &amp; progress.

However the feature was bought into Those Nights AT Randy's 3 as a achievement tracker. Scrapbook photos can be unlocked by doing the required task for their assigned night.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a7dee5ea3d06f9d35761788602e736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TropicalGames-Productions"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
