{"id": 963635, "slug": "land-above-sea-below-prologue", "name": "Land Above Sea Below Prologue", "name_original": "Land Above Sea Below Prologue", "description": "<strong>Immerse yourself</strong> in the tranquil world of the eternal autumn, where your goal is to build and expand your self-built island as wisely as possible to avoid being washed away by the ever-rising sea levels. <strong>Land Above Sea Below</strong> is a fine-tuned mixture of the landscape builder, puzzle, and strategy genre, with fun and constantly challenging gameplay, yet with a nice and calm atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>Your imagination is the only limit</strong> - from the infinitely available, procedurally generated tiles you can build the island of your dreams. Build majestic forests, cascading rivers, and lovely villages.<br/><br/><strong>Synergies</strong> can be created throughout properly placed groups of tiles, so your entire island can be positively affected by the placement of a single tile. Keeping this in mind from the very beginning of the game is a must.<br/><br/><strong>A forward-looking strategy</strong> is the key to success. With careful planning, you can place similar tiles that interact with each other in their best possible location. These interactions result in a <strong>height increase and award</strong> you with valuable points that can be transferred to essential aids during the game. By achieving certain score points, you can unlock different rewards, like extra steps in the season, a sea level decrease, or even a new Tree of Fall.<br/><br/><strong>The flood is coming</strong> at the end of every season. You need to ensure that your island - or at least your starting tile on which the Tree of Fall grows, is at a safe distance from sea level.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Procedurally generated tiles</strong> - you will have infinitely available, procedurally generated tiles that you can lay on the map. This method ensures, that every island you create, and every new game you play, will be unique, and unrepeatable. Autumn groves, rivers, rocky mountains, forests, villages, and sea items will inhabit your map.<br/></li><li><strong>Island extensions</strong> - as you progress in expanding your island and exploring undiscovered areas on the map, you might bump into lonely, tiny islands. If you connect your main island to them, these islands (its tiles) will be attached to your land.<br/></li><li><strong>Infinite gameplay mode</strong> - your goal is to keep the Tree Of Fall alive. As long as this tile is above sea level, the game continues. The length of the game only depends on how long you can survive.<br/></li><li><strong>Minimalistic style</strong> - we deliver precisely handcrafted beautiful biomes in the game, with the minimalistic style that we love so much.</li></ul><br/>This demo showcases a work-in-progress game. We used a season cap as a limitation, and we have reduced the availability of tile versions, but you will be able to taste the atmosphere and dive into the game's world.<strong> Put us on your wishlist and join us on Discord </strong> if you have enjoyed this early release demo version to follow us on the journey of completing our game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:29:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddc/ddc280938f8d882d6bfa6dc2485d60ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 43, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glasscannon Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skystone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
