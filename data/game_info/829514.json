The intention is to use this model to explore your thoughts on human happiness.By studying social life, I came up with three rules for the game. The game is designed by three rules.</p>\n<p>[The Law of Happiness\uff1a</p>\n<p>1. Happiness spreads, but one person's happiness also means  another's misfortune (Turing Spot, which indirectly inherits the rules  of the one-dimensional game of life)</p>\n<p>2. Happiness and misfortune kill each other, people can only be in  happiness and misfortune. (The cancellation principle, eventually  changed to the one or the other principle in this version)</p>\n<p>3. When the world is destroyed (5 minutes), one side wins if it has more than the other.]</p>\n<p>Abstract rules alone can't be played, so I need to design it as a game.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Theme: Happiness \r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Concept: Allow players to create happiness through collage elements within the confines of object collisions \r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Systems: Whimsical combination reaction(Beyond the Frame)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T10:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a65e952126990785ee800694cfa74c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ion_kawaii"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
