She's a beautiful, intelligent, talented (and most of all, very modest!) young woman. She yearns for something more from life and wishes to escape the dull reality she faces every day. On a fateful, rainy night, the sound of lightning wakes her from her slumber. She's suddenly enveloped by a blinding light which, to her surprise, summons her into another world.<br/><br/>There, the world's foremost god, Ashkelon, tasks her with the role of a hero in order to unite the kingdoms of humans, elves, and dwarves against the dark forces plotting to overthrow the very balance of the land.<br/><br/>Will Ayana succeed in her quest? How will her experiences in this other world shape her life? Can she make it back to her own world, or will she even want to? Find out how her story unfolds!<br/><br/><br/>Explore the large open world as you see fit! You can either start small by talking with townsfolk, gathering intel in taverns and taking on sidequests, or you can hitch a boat ride to different kingdoms and advance the main story right away!<br/><br/>Recruit party members with a variety of skills! Use whoever you want, whether it's the off-beat dragon priestess, the mysterious bard, or the werewolf woman with a tragic backstory. Your crew will learn different skills depending on what you equip them with, so you can experience something different in every playthrough.<br/><br/>What's more, your choices throughout the story will affect Ayana's attributes, and she can either develop into a fierce warrior or a wise mage.
