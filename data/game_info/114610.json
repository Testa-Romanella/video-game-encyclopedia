Starting from simple physics like gravity and collisions with players and walls, it later took on more advanced features including split-screen multiplayer and a track editor.</p><p>This prototype would then be named V-TEXER (named after Taito's racing game Vertexer).</p><p>V-TEXER is a high speed racing game, inspired by futuristic racing games like F-Zero and Wipeout. Players race each other on twisting roller coaster-like race tracks at over 1000 km/h! This game features:</p><ul><li>8 different vehicles. All of which play completely differently!</li><li>A detailed track editor (Press 'E' in the main menu). Build your own insane race tracks!</li><li>Four player split-screen multiplayer.
