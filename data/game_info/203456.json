You can choose from a preset of rounds or choose the amount yourself. At the beginning of each round the game will choose a random theme. For example: More enemies. That will increase the percentage for enemies to spawn.</p>\n<p>The round ends when one of the characters dies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of the round you get score for time, coins, enemies killed and in multiplayer there is an win/lose score. The score you get can be used to buy upgrades for you characters for the next rounds. The current upgrades are double jump, higher jump and a slam skill (to stomp enemies).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game currently have single player and local multiplayer. In single player you control both characters and the only current goal is to get the highest score. </p>\n<p>The single player can be played in as co-op but I hope to add a specific co-op mode with some different functions. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer is a competition and the winner of each round gets a bonus and the loser gets a penalty. The winner is the player with the most total score.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef5c8fc0d9069faed8253626a21d9a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZenriS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
