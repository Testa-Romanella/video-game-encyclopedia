The tenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released in Japan in December 2002, in North America in March 2003, and in Europe in May 2003.<br />\nThe game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea, a departure for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in a struggle for the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder&#39;s wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra \u2013 an incarnation of Princess Zelda \u2013 and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor&#39;s baton called the Wind Waker.<br />\nThe Wind Waker was directed by Eiji Aonuma and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It retains the basic 3D gameplay of its predecessors, Ocarina of Time and Majora&#39;s Mask, but with a distinctive cartoon-like art style created through cel shading. The game received widespread critical acclaim, but the art style proved divisive among players, which contributed to comparatively weak sales. As a result, Nintendo changed directions with the next Zelda installment, the more realistically-styled Twilight Princess. However, The Wind Waker&#39;s reputation improved over time, and it is now widely considered one of the greatest video games ever made. The Wind Waker originated the &quot;Toon Link&quot; variant of the main character, and received two direct sequels for the Nintendo DS, Phantom Hourglass (2007) and Spirit Tracks (2009). A high-definition remaster, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, was released for the Wii U in 2013, to critical acclaim.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-13T16:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/45f/45f6d31b0fcefe029e33d258a7beb6a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.35, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 248, "beaten": 401, "toplay": 140, "dropped": 87, "playing": 20}, "playtime": 37, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 457, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 26, "reviews_count": 460, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
