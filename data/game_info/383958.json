{"id": 383958, "slug": "the-last-captain", "name": "The Last Captain", "name_original": "The Last Captain", "description": "<p>This is \"The Last Captain\".</p>\n<p>Here is my first jam game in a year and a half maybe. This time coding was very much easier this time around. But I failed hard and doing the build,art and sound!!!!!</p>\n<p>When building the game everything was way to big or to small so I had to keep building and fixing then build, ect. I had to pause menu so I added a button to quickly exit out of the game.</p>\n<p>But about what you can play.</p>\n<p>You are a Captain. The Last Captain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You click on planets to gain crew members or kill to gain money. You then can go to the blue space stations to gain more food,water or power. If you have no power on your ship it's game over. Then you can click on the other enemy ships and battle in a turn based battle system. If you Gain more crew member you get more attacks on your ships. Then once all the enemy ships have been destroyed. A black hole(\"A white circle\") will appear then you can unlock a new level. So click that lol.</p>\n<p>I wish I had more to though out the week to do better art. It's was thanksgiving, had to go to work and spend time with love ones. But I did learn alot this time around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But while making this game I came up so many Ideas I wish I had time for. So I plan on taking this Idea an turning it into something else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the long run I should have came up with a smaller idea but it is what it is.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:00:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BoersInc"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
