By setting 4 players around a shared playable \u2018square\u2019 and making them interact with each other towards a collaborative goal, SIHEYU4N aims at abstractly and playfully reproduce the experience of social aggregation of the original siheyuan (Beijing\u2019s historical courtyards) residence concept, where 4 families used to live together on the 4 sides of a common \u2018quadrangle\u2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dd4/dd466c1bca5ab49b56461851084861f8.jpg", "website": "http://www.wearemuesli.it/siheyu4n/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["We Are M\u00fcesli"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
