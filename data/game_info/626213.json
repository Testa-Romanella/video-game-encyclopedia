{"id": 626213, "slug": "green-dude", "name": "Green Dude", "name_original": "Green Dude", "description": "Green Dude<p>In late 2020, I was hot on the tail of the project Bridge of Fate for Rodent Predator, which was very big, not finished, and showed no sign of slowing down - and by my standards I still needed to have at least one videogame completed before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>So I decided to rapidly create a new and simple game, which would quickly turn out to be Green Dude.</p>\n\n<p>Green Dude starts - simply enough - in a dark forest of tiled trees and ground trash. Escaping from this forest would be easy, but every time the circular man walks further down the swerving path to freedom, he falls in some hole in the darkness and has to deal with... spotty pots. This makes for some simple but engaging platforming in a minimal forest floor in a pit that has pits.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Jump and slide to the end of each of these lower levels, and kill those stock PNG file enemies that I had for a long time already saved on my hard drive, and avoid the ones that have that standard video game indication on them that say you can't!</p>\n<p>Green Dude was completed on the 26th of December in 2020 and originally released the very next day that same year. That was a huge relief, because Green Dude as a project would be unbelievably awkward and self-defeating if it still wasn't ready for publication in 2021. In 2021 - this year at the time of this writing - Bridge of Fate was released after being started much sooner than Green Dude, and thanks to my efforts, it made this year the fourth in a row since 2018 that I had published <em>at least one videogame</em>. With this, my newfound Itch.io library of my games is now up to date and complete. From now on, unless something terrible has happened, every game that I release on Hindbodes will be from present-day development completion. Including Green Dude, every game from before now was actually done before Bridge of Fate was, which perhaps-misleadingly had an earlier publication when it comes to stuff that's posted on Itch.</p>\n<p>Also, this game has a secret in it. Look out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06fd1ea7491706b03f3617aa6b93033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hindbodes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
