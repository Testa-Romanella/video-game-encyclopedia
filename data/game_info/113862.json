The owls are hooting, a slight breeze lets the branches of the forest around you come to life. Your ears are your only help, to not lose orientation and to make it to the church at the other side of the forest, where someone special is awaiting you.</p><p>Nightblind is an atmospherical horror first person exploration game and relies solemnly on audio as orientation, since all you can see is a black screen.</p><p>Many dangers will await you in the forest, including five horrifying ways to die, and there is only one way to reach the church safely:<br/><br/>DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!</p><p>Listen closely to your footsteps, as they will tell you when you left the path. If you get lost and start panicking: RUN!</p><p>The game was made in seven days for Halloween Game Jam 2016. The goal was to simulate a 3D-environment in 2D, using audio only.
