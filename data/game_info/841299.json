You also have to take care of the slopes.

Hopefully, this is not really perceivable.</li><li>The navigator version seems to lack mouse controls, at least on my Firefox. This may be caused by love.js or by Web-related focus issues rather than the game itself. (There was also no music, but I suddenly remembered that you have to switch the music from stream to static to make it work, and here you go! :))</li></ol>\r\nCreation context\r\n<p> <em>Made for Mini Jam 113 with theme <strong>\u2018Final Boss\u2019</strong> and limitation <strong>\u2018Stuck In A Loop\u2019</strong>. (Running time: from August 19th 2022 at 6:00 AM to August 22nd\u00a02022 at 6:00 AM.)<br/></em></p>\n<p>One very little note: I wavered with <em>Hotrock</em> (also by the Kevin) for the music, which is both \u2018bossy\u2019 and funny at the same time, but I went for the more serious and dramatic one seeing the game jam\u2019s theme. You can put it on for yourself while playing the game if you want to see what it would have looked like. ;)<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\nSounds\r\n<ul><li>\"Falling, Comedic, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org (excerpt)</li><li>\"Bicycle gear\" by HaseaN at Freesound.org</li><li>\"cooling down hot saucepan with water.wav\" by laspaziale at Freesound.org</li><li>\"fanfare 3.wav\" by RichHeard at Freesound.org</li></ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>Eternal Terminal</em> Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T09:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/1465e961d5c2e170ef00fcdbd508d93f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mossieur Patate"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
