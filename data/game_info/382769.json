We are absolutely excited with what we are making and we hope everyone who is interested about the dreadnought era and naval warfare, will join our ambitious project and support us.<br/><br/><strong>MAIN FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><strong>BUILD THE BATTLESHIPS THE WAY YOU WANT</strong><br/>Become the architect of powerful warships, from small torpedo boats to mighty Battleships! Recreate famous ships such as the HMS Dreadnought and countless speculative designs. Pick turret layout, armour scheme, funnel placement, tower variations making each ship design look and feel unique. Every design detail of your warships will directly affect their performance. Their hull characteristics, internal upgrade selection, and weight distribution not only modifies their speed and maneuverability but also their weapon effectiveness. <br/><br/><strong>STRONG AI</strong><br/>The AI evaluates the optimal engage distance, using principles of the \u201cImmunity Zone\u201d and comparing its own firepower vs your ships. These AI estimations make it to use ammunition wisely, either by holding fire or switching shell types according to the armor protection of the target. <br/><br/>Unless there is a special mission directive, the AI will not be a suicidal drone and will attempt to withdraw, if its fleet becomes heavily damaged or it is much weaker than yours. We continuously develop the AI in order to have a human-like and unexpected behavior, planning to feature special AI personalities according to nation.<br/><br/><strong>NAVAL ACADEMY</strong><br/>Test your ship design and tactical skills in the Academy. The \u201cNaval Academy\u201d includes more than 22+ battle scenarios, where you will have to design a ship or a squadron to fulfill a certain combat tactical task. Orders will range from destroying the stationary ship, with broken engines to fighting outnumbered against the overwhelming enemy. These numerous missions will allow you to practice and enjoy the many innovative design and combat aspects of the game, while we are developing the campaign.<br/><br/><strong>PLANNED FEATURE - GLOBAL CAMPAIGN - NOT YET AVAILABLE</strong><br/>Campaign is still under development. The campaign will let you lead the admiralty for all major countries of the time period (minor nations are not playable).
