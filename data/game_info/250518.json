Oh no!. He's also obsessed with passing through giant rings as he free falls to the ground. Don't ask me why, it's just his thing! <br/>- Your job is to guide Pete through the rings as he free falls. Move Pete by tilting your device in the direction you wish Pete to move. Aim for the ring's dead centre or risk missing. <br/>- Score 'Ring Points' by passing through rings. <br/>- Look out for other 'things' that may hinder Pete as he hurtles to the ground. Hitting them will not only slow Pete down but you will also lose a 'Ring Point'. <br/>- Not that he'd admit it but Pete is a little bit 'OCD' when it comes to free falling through giant rings. If you miss a ring, it's game over, start again! <br/><br/>Features <br/><br/>- Universal app compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. <br/>- Retina display optimised. <br/>- Game Center achievements and top score leaderboard supported.<br/>- Facebook and Twitter functionality supported.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b31e1a6782a28c6d05861f5acba58cc_WQtwhfj.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Andrew Herbert"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Paul HERBERT"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
