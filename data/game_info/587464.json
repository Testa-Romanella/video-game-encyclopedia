Main goal is to collect coins (the amount depends on the level) and then find a hidden door that will take you to the next map. The game is kept in a dark atmosphere. Ultimately, the mechanics will be based on torches and lighting fires that mark the way to a hidden passage. We plan to add a few mobs and stealth elements, and a combat system in future levels.\r\n</p><p>Inputs (2 ways of moving):\u00a0</p><p>Left Joystick\u00a0- moving forward/backward<br/></p><p>Right Joystick - turn left/right 10\u00b0 or turn backward</p><p>Right Trigger - teleport</p><p>Beware - menu buttons not works correctly yet (still working on it) sometimes You need to click more than once on them ;[</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T09:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1757188fb75a78767a98ab02b1dda3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rias Ryuzaki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
