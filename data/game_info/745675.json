Maybe honeycombs will help.</p>\n<p>This game was made primarily using GDevelop's shape painter as a challenge. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Please note: on the last level, the bee starts at the wrong point within the level. You can go back to see everything else but if you continue everything will still work out fine. This will be fixed after the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5ddd99db08baef7b13c7d94c26b32f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dinyny"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
