In the house they are staying at, she comes across a mysterious spell book and decides to try a spell for fun. What ensues is her worst nightmare.\u00a0A horde of demons are released\u00a0intent on taking her family to the underworld. Her only hope is to use her special ability of \"entanglement\" to fight off the monsters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spookie's Actions is a 2D top down, atmospheric,\u00a0narrative adventure that uses\u00a0a unique entanglement game mechanic. This game was done for the Magical Girl Game Jam where teams could pick from several quantum physics ideas. We picked Spooky Action and Schrodinger's Box. \"Spooky Action\" refers to the mysterious way entangled particles react to each other. When one particle changes, the other entangled particle changes as well. Scientists are still not sure how this happens. It's almost magical in a way, just like in this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:51:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4ab5e23bd16ecb8e4b3979c6d2cec33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ralphyua"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
