Who are you? Where are you? Who is the mysterious voice that keeps on talking to you? Why are these\u2026 robots attacking a main server?</p>\n<p>Grab your katana sword, smash through incoming robots and discover terrifying truth about you and MSS, Incorporated!</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY?</strong></p>\n<p>Click left mouse button to hit enemy with katana. Click right mouse button to use special dash ability that reloads every 3 seconds. Robots damage main server every 3 seconds. After 100 hits, the server will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>If you want to talk to The Voice or get more information walk right to the green console and hit spacebar. Remember - the game cannot be paused, so the server will continue to be damaged by robots while you\u2019re using the console.</p>\n<p>The game is quite short and has two main endings (and a server death screen), so we highly encourage you to replay it and unblock both endings. :)</p>\n<p><strong>GAME WAS MADE BY:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>CEELMAH\u00a0@Mordechai\u00a0- programming</li><li>CYGI\u00a0@Cygi\u00a0- music, special effect and cutscenes</li><li>THOMASWARD\u00a0@thomasward\u00a0- story, script and creative decisions</li><li>JONEK\u00a0@iasha\u00a0- UI and some graphics</li></ul>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>supertrain - for dialogue proofreading</li><li>Ozzzim - for making a graphic we\u2019ve never used (thanks anyway :)</li><li>Igor - for making some miscellaneous graphics</li></ul>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong>\u00a0In an update, we fixed two critical game bugs (which is okay by the jam rules).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dc1af2bb9f97d3b57e8dac362a51514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ceelmah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
