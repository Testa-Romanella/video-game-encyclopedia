This chocolate isn't going on a turnaround route to your best friend (who hopes otherwise)! <br/>A parody otome game with five endings and a fair amount of extra content!<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><strong>PROJECT INFO</strong><br/>Hello, all~ Krissy of Silverspork Productions here!<br/>A little background on \"\u305b\u3093\u3071\u3044 ~\u79c1\u3092\u898b\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044~\" (<em>lit. \"Senpai ~Please Look At Me~\"</em>).<br/>It was initially tossed together as a project for a Nihongo class project a couple years ago (even we find it hard to believe it's been that long).<br/>Just recently, we picked it up again decided to fix up for others to try out. <br/>Our class and a few alpha-testers gave positive feedback about the game, so we hope you'll all enjoy it as well!</p>\n<p>Some of the scenarios are written to poke fun at a few common otome game details, <br/>though we might have gotten carried away and put more focus on romance than on making it a parody, but there's enough humor to go around!<br/><br/>It's been up on our Tumblr page, as well as on the LSF for a little over a month, and even if it's no longer the valentine's season, we do hope we can still spread the love around a bit over here as well ;)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cc3212b3c4f6228f8284bb46ba38163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Silverspork Productions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
