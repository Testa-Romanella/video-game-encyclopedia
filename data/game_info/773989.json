You play as an adventurer lost in time and space, with enemies and traps behind every corner. Explore a seemingly endless tunnel full of mystery and death, find mythical creatures, many foes, and few friends!<br/><br/>You can unlock different weapons so you can proceed further easily. What more do you want?<br/><br/>\"If I can beat this game, so can you!\" - One of the people who made this game.<br/><br/>Each monster has it's own battle style and way to be defeated. The rest is adaptation and anticipation.<br/><br/>The story is irrelevant as it happens in all time and space. But it will get clearer some time in somewhere.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T18:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/072c674c81d63ee2b7a61fe9687ef3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roni Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
