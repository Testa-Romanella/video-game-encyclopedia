Here the forces of <strong>N\u00e5ture</strong> will try to fend off <strong>Ind\u00fbstry</strong> in a battle that will end when the field is full.\r\n</p>\n<p>Take turns against your AI opponent as you drag and drop tiles from your hand to the field.\r\n</p>\n<p>The winner is the player with the most influenced tiles at the end. \r\n</p>\n<p>Tiles  are placed as neutral, but every 10 seconds influence spreads from  trees (N\u00e5ture) and Factories (Ind\u00fbstry) to connected tiles.\r\n</p>\n<p>Tiles  can only be put on the field connecting to other tiles. Remember to  rotate your tiles to have a better chance of connecting the tiles. It will take 10 seconds to grow influence for both sides and you will  receive a new tile in your hand. \r\n</p>\n<p>Influence will grow to adjacent tiles if the way is not blocked. \r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Nature influence can be blocked by roads and walls.\r\n</li><li>Industry influence can be blocked by rivers and forests. \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This will only work if you correctly block them: just placing them all vulnerable will not protect your influence!\r\n</p>\n<p>If your hand is full (max 8 tiles) your opponent will place a <strong>Toxic</strong>  tile every 10 seconds. Hurry and put a tile from your hand on the Toxic  tile to sacrifice both tiles. Toxic will grow every 10 seconds and will  consume every nature tile adjacent if not properly blocked or  sacrificed before the timer is done. Toxic will count as Industry so  make sure you either block or sacrifice swiftly!\r\n</p>\n<p>Hint: Play your full hand on the field to get 4 new tiles immediately!\r\n</p>\n<p>When the field is full, counting of total influence will commence and the game will be over. \r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For the sake of L\u00e5ndskein, do not let industry win! \r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck and thank you for playing!\r\n</p>\nLinkshttps://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/landskein/\r\n\r\n<p>(not working? try the embedded version on the ludum dare website!)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c331d3178f2c15a80027d55b4ea0208e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Majogames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
