The theme was blocked so we used blocks for the enemies and whenever you look at an enemy with your flashlight, it prevents (blocks) them from moving. There is an issue with the game crashing sometimes when you collect a coin-cube. At the moment we are unaware of what causes it.</p>\n<p>You awake in a forest, seeing glowing cubes in the distance. Your curiosity is peaked, but as you approach the mysterious objects you notice movement out of the corner of your eye.</p>\n<p>I worked on the player movement, enemy navmesh, and jumpscare mechanics. If the player turns around and an enemy is close to them, a jumpscare sound effect will play.</p>\n<p>~ CONTROLS ~</p>\n<p>WASD : Move character</p>\n<p>Mouse : Orient camera view</p>\n<p>Space\u00a0: Jump</p>\n<p>Shift\u00a0: Sprint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287768dcfd5c43c3ad6db269a2469f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Night0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
