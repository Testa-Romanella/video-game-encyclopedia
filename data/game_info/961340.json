Currently there are 8 pets available, and many more to come! You can manage which pets you want to take out and customize your interactions with them! Pets go around wondering around your taskbar! You can customize area where pets are starting. You can set pets to be either \"friendly\" or \"annoyed\". When they are friendly, you will be able to pet them when clicking on them, else if they are \"annoyed\" they will run away from your cursor so you can chase them around! The main function of \"annoyed\" mode is that pets don't disturb you while you are working and using the taskbar.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T05:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/85204b4bf83fc4a17db300f8bb35fa11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lazarche"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["lazarche"], "esrb_rating": null}
