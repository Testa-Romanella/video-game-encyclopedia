Inspired by GURPS, the rule-set for combat is a bit complex (or obscure) for a Game Jam so reading the brief manual below might be handy.<br/>\r\n\tThe AI use a weight-table system to determine it's action. Far from perfect, it still shouldn't do anything completely stupid. Each enemy also has a \"personality\" of sort so that some enemies will take their time and be more defensive while others might just go full attack non stop.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAs a note, I was going for more serious AI names at first but wanted to do some sound and there was no way I could make anything I recorded with my crappy mic sound not goofy so I adapted the names.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tEnjoy!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tS : turn sound on/off\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tESCAPE: quits back to main menu\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSPACEBAR: during your turn, to END TURN.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tMOUSEWHEEL UP/DOWN (or +/- from keypad): rotate FACING (yellow marker on miniature base).\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t0, 1-6 (Alpha): Select MANEUVER for that turn.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tTAB: Toggles on/off display of MANEUVER panel and/or CHARACTER PANEL during your turn. Handy to see the battle field before selecting a maneuver.\r\n\t<br/>\r\nT: (debug)during AI turns if it gets stuck\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>INTERFACE:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Upper left number is your MOVE left for the turn.</li>\n<li>Upper right cross is the turn indicator (blue for you, red for enemy). Click on it to END TURN (or just press SPACEBAR)</li>\n<li>Bottom message that appears is the AI current chosen battle action for this turn.</li>\n<li>Action effects will appear during battle above the actors' heads (MISS, HIT, etc)</li>\n<li>Little red squares will appear during battle on TORSO, ARMS or LEGS. For TORSO, this indicates the actor is not at full HP. For ARMS and LEGS, this indicate a CRIPPLED state (which, as a one off but permanent, reduce skills/stats quite a bit).</li>\n<li>The small YELLOW markers on the actors's base is FACING. The 3 squares in front of the actor are FRONT. The 1 square directly behind is BEHIND. The other squares are SIDE.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>CHARACTER CREATION:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>The ARMOUR type (light/heavy) determines your MAX MOVE, DAMAGE RESISTANCE and ARMOR LOAD PENALTY (which impacts all skills).</li>\n<li>LOADOUT allows for either a THRUSTING BROADSWORD (SWORD) or a SHORT SWORD &amp; SHIELD (SWORD &amp; SHIELD).</li>\n<li>SWORD provides better attack skill and damage (espectially Thrusting attacks that manage to pierce the armor) but only PARRY or DODGE as active defenses.</li>\n<li>SWORD &amp; SHIELD provides better defenses overall as well as a good BLOCK value but a bit less attack skill than just SWORD and lower damage, which can be rough against Heavy armored opponents.</li>\n<li>To change your character's FACE, just click on it.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>MANEUVERS</strong><br/>\r\n\t0 - DO NOTHING: duh\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t1 - MOVE: allows full move. Rotating cost a move.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t2 - MOVE and ATTACK: move and attack during though at lowered chance skill. Rotating cost a move.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t3 - ATTACK: allows a step in any direction and an attack. Rotating is free (do before attack).\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t4 - ALL OUT ATTACK: allow movement (forward only) and a special attack (either very PRECISE, STRONG damage or DOUBLE ATTACK!) but NO DEFENSE UNTIL NEXT ROUND! Rotate cost a move.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t5 - ALL OUT DEFENSE: allows a step in any direction and boosts your active defense for a turn. Rotating is free.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t6 - EVALUATE: allows a step in any direction and stacks up bonus to hit until next attack or until hurt. Up to 4 stacks (not displayed :/)\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>MOVING AROUND</strong><br/>\r\n\tClick on the tile you want to move into.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tRotate using Mousewheel (or +/-). Do before moving and/or attacking usually.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>ATTACKING</strong><br/>\r\n\tAttacks are processed as follows: \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Attacker indicates type of attack.</li>\n<li>Attacker indicates desired hit location.</li>\n<li>Attacker rolls 3D6 and compares the result to a modified \"effective attacj skill\" rating (base skill modified by shock penalty, armor penalty, position of actors, etc)</li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tIF the roll is equal or below the rating, the Defender now defends himself. Otherwise, attack is just a miss.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Defender processes best defense available (usually highest, this is automatic)</li>\n<li>Defender rolls 3D6 and compares the result to a modified \"effective defense skill\" rating (base skill modified by shock penalty, armor penalty, position of actors, etc)</li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tIF the roll is equal of below the rating, the Defender successfully defended and the attack is over usually (ALL OUT ATTACK, Double attack get to attack twice)\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIF the roll is above the rating, the Defender is hit and damage is calculated\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tNote that if the Attacker rolls a CRITICAL HIT, the Defender cannot defend at all.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAlso note that Defending from an attack coming from the side carries a very small penalty. From behind is almost impossible to defend! Careful with your facing.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>DAMAGE:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>If Hit, the Attacker rolls for Damage, which varies depending if SWING or THRUST was chosen during the attack selection.</li>\n<li>To this Damage is substracted the DAMAGE RESISTANCE of the target.</li>\n<li>The remaining Damage is penetrating and depending on hit location is multiplied/modified.</li>\n<li>Current HP of the target is then reduced by the Damage that penetrated.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>HEALTH:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Any damage taken inflicts a SHOCK penalty (all skills) for a full turn equal to the damage done (up to a limit).</li>\n<li>Once an Actor reaches 0 or below, he needs to pass a health check at the end of each of his turn to stay awake. If this fails, the battle is over.</li>\n<li>Once an Actor reaches -2x max HP, he dies.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>WINNING &amp; Other stuff:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>If you beat all enemies (or escape), you win the game. Grats!</li>\n<li>After each battle, you'll get a small level up choice. Note that you do NOT regain any lost HP between battles unless you rest.</li>\n<li>The system uses 3D6 to determine results. That means a curve bell mechanic which makes things like Evaluate and All Out Defense, which provide small flat boosts, actually quite powerful.</li>\n<li>Escaping is \"almost\" impossible.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tHave fun and don't hesitate to leave feedback\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Mutonizer.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>v1.01a:\r\n<br/>- Revamped entire thing to fit perfectly on a 64x64 pixel perfect grid.</p><p> v1.00b:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Fixed damage indicators not displaying properly on all \"lines\".\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Tweaked aggressive AI weight tables a bit.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Remade VS screens to remove weirdo blur pixels effect.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Re-uploaded in 640x640.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Changed debug key for AI turn if they somehow get stuck to \"T\".
