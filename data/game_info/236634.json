Pilot a probe on a far away planet, gathering samples from the weird native flowers and breeding them together to make new hybrids. Watch their genes merge and mutate, just like those of our own world, producing strange new creations to grow in your alien gardens.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Grow your own <em>Proteus</em>. No goals. No objectives. No pressure. Just a peaceful sandbox in which to experiment, create, and relax.</li><li>Tens of thousands of possible surreal plants.</li><li>Watch your plants change and mutate as their genes combine and rearrange, just like those or our own world.</li><li>Inspired by science!
