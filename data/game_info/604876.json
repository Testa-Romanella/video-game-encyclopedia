{"id": 604876, "slug": "the-generation-game", "name": "The Generation Game", "name_original": "The Generation Game", "description": "The Generation Game\r\n<p>The Generation Game is a simple game generator and editor. Created as a University project over the course of one semester, the game aims to encourage creativity and game design processes. The random games can be impossible, trivial or just boring. However, every single game is completely editable, so you can take bad games and refine them into something interesting.</p>\n<p>Games are all primarily mouse driven. You can create a number of entity types that all behave differently. These behaviours are driven by interactions, which consist of one input and a number of results. Each result consists of a result type and a value, as well as an 'other actor' field which only applies to collisions.</p>\r\nInputsNearTriggered when the mouse is near the entity this is attached to.FarTriggered when the mouse is far from the entity this is attached to.HoverTriggered while the mouse is directly over the entity this is attached to.ClickTriggered when the entity this is attached to is clicked on.CollisionTriggered when the entity this is attached to\u00a0collides with another entity. Can be any other entity or restricted to a specific one.\r\n<strong>Results</strong>MovementxMoves in the x axis. Value should be\u00a0a number, positive for right and negative for left.MovementyMoves in the y axis. Value should be\u00a0a number, positive for right and negative for left.ColourChanges colour. Value should be one of the available colours, with a capital letter.ToggleToggles a number of properties depending on the value. 'gravity' will toggle the gravity, 'movement' will freeze and unfreeze an entity, 'follow' will cause the entity to loosely follow the mouse as if attached by an elastic string.RepelMoves away from the mouse. Value is the strength of this movement, and should be a number.\r\n<p>Included are 10 demo games, and 4 games created by my first play testers.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nTo keep games between sessions, press the '+' in the save menu and then enter a new save name. 'Save here' will overwrite that save game with the currently loaded game. If you accidentally delete a demo game, you can restore them all but this will also delete all your extra saved games.<br/>There is a max size of 1MB\u00a0for total saved games. The 14 included games come to just over 200KB.\r\n<p>Read more:\u00a0https://www.uobgames.com/studentwrite-ups/emily-stell-final-major-project-games-...</p>\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n<ul><li>The rules section doesn't display the rules in a very clear way</li><li>Units aren't consistent. Entity positions work on 0-8 grid positions, but for position goals the centre is 0,0 and the bounds are about -4 to 4. Y values are slightly offset because the play space is not in the centre of the screen.</li><li>Case sensitive options suck. Colours require capitals but toggles don't. Ideally neither would be case sensitive.</li><li>Toggle values are confusing. A lot of functionality is hidden under this option and requires you to type specific words.</li><li>Delete buttons in the game editor are not positioned ideally. It is not always clear which 'level' you are deleting.</li><li>You cannot delete the first level of each option (the first entity, the first interaction, and position in each entity etc.) This was done because you need at least one of each for the system to work, but it can get annoying if you want to delete the first one but keep another. This could be changed so you can delete any option as long as there is more than one left.</li><li>Errors in the edit game form aren't always flagged. The form will fail if you:\u00a0<ul><li>Don't fill in a 'value' field</li><li>Don't put the right kind of data in a 'value' field, or misspell a word/don't capitalise correctly</li><li>Try to have more than one interaction with the same input in a single entity</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5b063e509eac3e4d5494c4abe6b5b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["duriavenator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
