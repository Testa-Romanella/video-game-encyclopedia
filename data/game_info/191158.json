The goals of this assignment are to get to know the basics of the Unity plaftorm and all its components such as game scene, game objects, and so on.</p>\n<p>The course gives you all the assets, such as, textures, sounds and even the scripts. Since I am a Student of System Engineering and have experience with programming using C++, one of my priorities is to learn C# and use my own scripts.</p>\r\nWhy did I remake this assignment?\r\n\r\n<p>Once I finish the course I did three asignments, the first assignment was this simulation and the other two were games. I wanted to remake everything I have made with everything I learned and create my own scripts because the course is more of an introduction, it is about how to set up everything than create a texture, script and those things that are commonly made with others software.</p>\r\nWhich are the improvements?\r\n\r\n<p>The assignment was really simple, it had every planet if with a RotationAround Script that managed their behavior, and some sounds attached to the Camera and the Sun, only one Scene.</p>\n<p>My improvements are my own scripts, different textures, different background sound, Post processing behavior attached to the camera, two more scenes (Loading Scene, Menu Scene), Canvas components with the Menu Scene, Canvas components to display a planet description when clicked and a Particle System for the Sun.</p>\r\nWhere can I see the old version of the assignment?\r\n\r\n<p>Go on youtube and look for: Solar System Simulation Coursera. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/4450cd34f4aa9d51aa8b83ebaabcd043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Juan Borges"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
