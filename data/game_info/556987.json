{"id": 556987, "slug": "kansas-city-shuffle", "name": "Kansas City Shuffle", "name_original": "Kansas City Shuffle", "description": "<p>Listen up, Ace! A few of the adventurers that you saved from the jailhouse have gotten themselves locked up again by Jack O'Lantern himself.</p>\n<p>They say that he's a reasonable guy. Maybe you can go in there and try and strike a deal with him or something. Whatever you do, you've got to bring those good men and women back home to their families.</p>\n<p>KEYS:</p>\n<p>- HOLD ALT and move the Mouse to Look and aim.</p>\n<p>- Use SPACEBAR to pick a cup.</p>\n<p>- Use the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to use buttons.</p>\n<p>HINTS:</p>\n<p>Jack is a sneaky but fair guy. He'll give you more coins every time you win, but be warned. He'll also take more after that. Follow the coin as it moves with the cup and then HOLD the ALT + Mouse to look at the cup. (You could even check out the other adventurers behind you, but we recommend you do that in between shuffles.</p>\n<p>Once Jack stops shuffling, use the SPACEBAR to select the correct cup. If you win 40 coins, you'll free all of the adventurers. If you go 10 coins under, well...we'll have to send in someone else.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n<p>You'll need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T07:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a71c632326b2ee0694d35f30f6ba72d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zayd Carelse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
