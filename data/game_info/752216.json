With no other way to move around, your quest is to blast yourself upwards with the kickback of a shotgun, and find your way to the surface of the world!<br/><br/><h3>Story</h3>\u201eThe prophecy spoke of a light in the darkness... The Sun\u2019s final spark would descend into the deepest abyss, and await the coming of the Saviour\u2026\u201c<br/><br/>You find yourself in a strange predicament \u2013 being stuck up to your waist inside a talking wooden barrel, who has \u2013 along with you \u2013 lost it\u2019s memories to the darkness of the Abyss. You can\u2019t recall why you ventured into the deepest place on Earth, yet know that the lantern you carry is of great importance to your quest. Can you rediscover the past and uncover the fate of the world \u2013 and the point of your journey \u2013 as you climb upwards?<br/><br/>Guided by nothing but the Holy Spirit of an almost extinct religion called \u201eThe Way of the Shotgun\u201c, you need to light holy shrines, replenish ammo, uncover Ancient Shotguns and use them to reach places no ordinary shotgun-less human could.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/><strong>Your shotgun can fire twice before reloading!</strong><br/>Shoot once, then again in mid-air to alter the direction of your flight, or blast both barrels at once for a much stronger jump!<br/><br/><strong>Mastery is key!</strong><br/>Learning from your mistakes is a must - every stage of the climb presents an increased level of challenge, with no checkpoints to guard your progress... Should you make a grave mistake \u2013 climb once more from the depth you fell to!<br/><br/>- <strong>Multiplayer!</strong><br/>Join your friends on the journey to the surface! Other players shall appear in your game as \u201cphantoms\u201d- ghosts from different worlds and timelines. Watch them closely as they advance alongside you, and learn from their mistakes!<br/><br/>- <strong>Light Shrines as you climb upwards!</strong><br/>The ancient Sprit of Shotgun was forgotten and only you can bring back it\u2019s former glory! Shine your lantern on abandoned shrines to restore them, and have them provide you with ammunition!<br/><br/>- <strong>The ammo you carry is limited!</strong><br/>Should you make too many mistakes and end up with no shells left, you\u2018ll be forced to return to the last Shrine you lit! Keep an eye on your ammo count at all times, as shrines are not always guaranteed to be near...<br/><br/>- <strong>No checkpoints! But...</strong><br/>You can find an item called \u201eMartyr\u2019s Bone\u201c scattered around in the Underdark. These sacred objects can be used to transport you upwards to the last shrine you lit, in order to recover your progress! However, once spent \u2013 they\u2019re gone for good. Save them for a rainy day.<br/><br/>- <strong>Bullettime!</strong><br/>Your talking barrel companion has the magical ability to slow down time, which works in tandem with your double-barrel shotgun. Fire once on the ground to blast off, enter Bullettime, then shoot once again in mid-air to alter the direction of your flight! If executed with precision, this technique will allow you to traverse any region of the Underdark in seconds.<br/><br/>- <strong>Achievements!</strong><br/>There\u2019s a bunch of achievements. Nice!<br/><br/><h3>Environment</h3>- <strong>Many realms of the Underdark await your arrival...</strong><br/>Be it places from ancient mythology, such as The Pits of Tartarus, or the resting place of the Ice-Father Ymir, or realms long forgotten \u2013 like the great Nether Frontier and the Desolation... All of them bring something new to the table, both lore and gameplay-wise.<br/><br/>- <strong>Atmosphere!</strong><br/>Every stage was meticulously conceptualized, drawn and assembled to form a cohesive whole that gives off it\u2019s own unique sense of atmosphere \u2013 each with it\u2019s very own soundtrack, high-definition ambiences, lore and secrets!<br/><br/>- <strong>Collectibles!</strong><br/>In places that are often challenging to reach, you can uncover a blast from the past... \u2013 the Ancient Shotguns. Each was designed to stand out with it\u2019s unique environment-themed appearance, as well as it\u2019s own sound, lore and special effects. Uncover them all to become the owner of the Great Collection!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Way of the Shotgun is our only salvation!
