Initially planned for last Christmas as a present, work didn't leave me enough time to finish it properly so it was delayed until now, which is now a present for my older brother. Truth to be told, it would have never been finished on December 2019! Tons of stuff has been added since then, including a complete overhaul of the road-display engine.</p>\n<p>And finally, I decided to go fora GBC look instead of staying in 4 colours.\u00a0It is more vivid this way and I really like how it looks. Didn't have time or money to comission someone to do 30 music tracks in GB style so I went with the GBA OST.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0hope you will enjoy this as much as I enjoyed making it! (and hope you'll start creating a few tracks for fun!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T05:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc608c16a9b1d2a64ff48f6a6b2f4665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linky439"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
