A\u00a0handful of survivors actively search for ways to get those who remain out alive. Other, more disheveled participants begin sowing seeds of doubt in everyone\u2019s minds with baseless accusations that may have dire\u00a0consequences.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>However, there is\u00a0one thing that\u00a0all the participants have in common regardless of which course of action they\u2019ve taken: despite their unfortunate and undesirable lives, they still cling to the thought of a better tomorrow. Though now, even with what they thought to be the key to their happiness dangling in front of them, this \"better tomorrow\" is\u00a0life the way it was just mere days ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>Still, even with the fear and hopelessness they feel, something even darker is in store for them. Those who\u2019ve died aren\u2019t happy and have returned to haunt the remaining participants. Not only that, but literal ghosts from their pasts are beginning to reveal themselves as well.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>No one feels safe anymore. No one knows if what\u2019s happening is even real. Some are starting to question that if they do win the brighter future they\u2019ve always wanted, will they even be sane enough to enjoy it?\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is HIGHLY recommended to play\u00a0the first episode\u00a0before playing either the preview or Einsamkeit: Halwende Episode Two when it releases.</strong></p>\n\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a game for children or the faint of heart\r\n<p>Einsamkeit: Halwende contains sensitive and mature topics that may trigger some and are not suitable for younger audiences.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\u00a0\r\nYou Choose the Game\r\n<p>There\u2019s more than one way for the mastermind's game to unfold. Make choices that can\u00a0alter the story drastically not only in this episode, but the episodes to come, creating a vast branch of different endings by the final episode.\r\n</p>\r\nComplete Unpredictability\u00a0\r\n<p>A death game story would be a little generic nowadays if there was a main character who was guaranteed to live, even in the canon ending... so the story is told in multiple perspectives, giving everyone proportionate importance.\r\n</p>\r\nMultiple Styles of Horror\u00a0\r\n<p>Einsamkeit: Halwende is described as a supernatural horror\u00a0drama because those are the main horror elements, but there\u2019s also psychological horror, slasher, body, &amp; monster horror!\u00a0(Not all types appear in the first episode.)\r\n</p>\n\r\nA Unique and Diverse Cast\r\n<p>Einsamkeit: Halwende\u2019s story would be bland if all the characters\u00a0were similar, so you\u2019ll see all kinds of folks from different strokes: a\u00a0nice mixture of races, ages, social classes, sexual orientations, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Ainsley:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>An employee at Motel 7 Heaven who wants nothing more than the end of human suffering.

Ever since high school she's claimed to have been stalked by a former foster sibling, but not only does no one believe her, no one seems to remember the atrocities the child committed when he stayed with her family as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Christie:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Nyx's roommate and one of her best friends. She's a very sociable girl who anyone can get along with, yet no one truly knows her or her past.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Layle:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A good friend of Christie and Nyx. He's at their school studying music theory, but because he comes from a well-off family it\u2019s often wondered why he ended up at no-name school since he could've gone anywhere with his parents' coin.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Asreal:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The only therapist in town. He has somewhat of a god complex and must always have control of any situation. As the therapist of some of the other characters he comes off as the one who holds the most standing in the game.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Lily:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A woman who has Asreal in the palm of her hand. She goes to him to ease her family who believes she has a strong addiction to sex, but there's more to her than anyone could fathom.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Dolores:\u00a0\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Known all over town for her insanity, Dolores is a woman beyond any salvation. She wants to kill Asreal more than anything for reasons that made him quit the asylum he worked at before starting his own practice.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Travis:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As one of Dolores' twin sons, Travis has been bullied relentlessly for as long as he can remember because of his mother's reputation.

He only ever speaks in esoterics, and for some reason has an obsession with Ainsley.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Toni:\u00a0\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>One of the only two contestants who knows a bit about what's going on. She's as calculated and calm as she is beautiful, and she won't stop until she gets what she wants.\r\n</p>\r\n\u00a0Cecil:\r\n<p>Toni's only friend, and the only other person who has any idea of what's happening.
