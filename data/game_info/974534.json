After a failed laboratory experiment, most of the planet's humanity was overrun by spiders. What remains is a laboratory with our world-famous, genius Professor Dr. MS-SI.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInitially, the mission objective is set by the command center in such a way that the professor must be rescued and freed at all costs using resources.<br/>\r\nIt later turns out that our esteemed professor is possessed by spiders and is obviously starting to mutate and cannot be stopped. The mission objective is changed so that the professor must be eliminated. Now they come into play Commander!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1. Prevent the spiders from spreading further.<br/>\r\n2.

The global world government has tried to cover up the nuclear contamination and denies any form of alien spiders. Failure is not accepted. The government expects a takeover from all enemy hands and the complete eradication of all enemy forces. This is the only way to achieve a new population of humanity. To this end, initial arrangements were made to resettle the chosen people.<br/>\r\nThe government will soon start sending secret messages and transmitting the coded tickets for a new life on the planet \u201cEarth One\u201d. We regret to inform Commander that a ticket costs 1 million Global, we expect tumultuous conditions and expect a victory announcement shortly. A place on \u201cEarth One\u201d has been secured for you, but only if you achieve the mission objective!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe new planet \u201cEarth One\u201d must be freed from the alien spiders and the professor, otherwise there is a risk of destruction and global collapse.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat's why we make them -------------- Commander the savior of humanity!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T04:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fc01c8f2cd7211996708c0115352e57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Manie Solutions UG"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Manie Solutions UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
