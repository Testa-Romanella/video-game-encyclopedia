It constantly changes, but ultimately it doesn't change at all. </strong><br/>\n<strong>This is a game about that.</strong></em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e438d0d48ecd5058e54fd7b4cfe4eb72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Isaque Sanches"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
