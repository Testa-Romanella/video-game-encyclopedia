Please feel free to post any comments, bugs, and opinions on my game.</p>\n<p>This is a first person action game with a programming/computer theme. Currently, it contains a passive skill tree large enough with the intent of not being able to activate all nodes in order to promote some planning. One projectile skill is available with two augments for it. More variety is planned. The goal is to simply get as far as you can defeating the bugs and becoming a proficient programmer, as a character.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T05:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9dc07cdee168d6d68524c323f84e32f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shiraha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
