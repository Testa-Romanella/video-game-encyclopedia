Your snake length increases every second so the challenge becomes more and more difficult.<br/>\r\nIf you play alone, you just run vs time. If you play with friends, the last dragon standing is declared winner.<br/>\r\nThis game can be played up to <strong>8 players locally</strong> on your computer. One player may use the <strong>keyboard</strong>, but it is recommended to use <strong>any controller pad</strong> you have (tested with XBox, Gamecube and PlayStation-like controllers, it rocks !).<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to play, just plug your pad and push any BUTTON (or SPACE) only once to register. When all players have registered, press a second time BUTTON/SPACE and the game starts automatically.<br/>\r\nYou can pause the game pressing ESCAPE. During pause, you can either press ESCAPE again to kill the game (back to main menu) or press BUTTON/SPACE to resume.<br/>\r\nDuring game you control your dragon with ANALOG STICK (or keyboard LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS).<br/>\r\nWhen the game is finished, a screen appears automatically, showing the maximum snake lengths for all players.
