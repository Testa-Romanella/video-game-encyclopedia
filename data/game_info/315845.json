Pay careful attention to each character - both to their story and to any descriptive clues - as your overall score will depend on how efficiently you share your memories.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T12:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596d0d7c02bce584eb91543b2b2193b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JoshyOshKenoshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
