{"id": 59041, "slug": "semblance", "name": "Semblance", "name_original": "Semblance", "description": "<p>Semblance is an innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set in a beautiful minimalist world. It\u2019s a game that asks, what if you could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a \u2018platform\u2019 in a platformer and turns it on its head. What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?<br />\nExplore a world where the default is soft, where the property of &#39;hardness&#39; doesn&#39;t exist. Each of the game&#39;s three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world&#39;s life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance<br />\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:<br />\nCan\u2019t reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down  the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.<br />\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design:<br />\nExplore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas.  Become hypnotized by each world&#39;s dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.<br />\nExplore non-linearly<br />\nThe game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game&#39;s narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-24T05:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/911/911f39fc82767d8cfe84a266c10cf68d.jpg", "website": "http://semblance-game.com/", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 141, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 4, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Nyamakop"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Good Shepherd Entertainment", "Gambitious"], "esrb_rating": null}
