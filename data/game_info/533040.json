You and your player 2 are <strong>tethered</strong> onto a life support box and need to survive in space. Your spaceship is busted, and you must repair it by collecting ten parts of it before time runs out, all the while avoiding asteroids. You can get more time by collecting oxygen containers, and more health with health containers. You\u2019ll lose health if your characters, tethers or life support box gets hit by an asteroid or other space junk. The fast moving asteroids are hard to avoid if the players are too far apart and the ship parts can only be collected by dragging the life support box on top of them. Going solo will lead to a quick defeat.<br/>The game was made to be played in a fair/expo type of event and it \r\nsucceeded in that by winning the ICT-showroom at Turku University of \r\nApplied Sciences in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Guide:</strong><br/>The tethernauts can be controlled with the arrow keys and WASD buttons.<br/>The menus can also be navigated only with arrow keys and WASD + Enter.<br/>The game was made to be played with two gamepad controllers, but works well on a single keyboard too.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>-Team-</strong><br/>Joonas Muukkonen <br/>Aissa Nylund<br/>Jaani Nordberg<br/>Marko Pakanen</p>\n<p><strong>- Gameplay Programming -</strong>\n<br/>Joonas\r\n<br/>Marko<br/></p>\n<p>- Music - <br/>Joonas</p>\n<p><strong>- Sound effects-<br/></strong>Jaani<br/></p>\n<p><strong>- 3D Art &amp; UVW Mapping-</strong><br/>Jaani</p>\n<p><strong>- A</strong><strong>nimation &amp; Rigging -</strong> <br/>Aissa</p>\n<p><strong>- Additional 3D Art -<br/></strong><strong> </strong>Aissa</p>\n<p><strong>- 2D Art -</strong> <br/>Aissa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d73a4f9ecf9408b3cb2fd37d5d86be7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aishark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
