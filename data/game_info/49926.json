The king becomes sick and lies on his deathbed. A miserable rain-soaked cat named \u201cBabri Khan\u201d together with its kitten accidentally enters the king\u2019s palace and somehow arrives at his room. Seeing that the room is warm and cozy, the cat leaves the kitten under the king\u2019s bed and intends to leave the house when it runs into the closed door. According to a local superstition, if a cat leaves its kitten underneath a patient\u2019s bed, he/she would be healed. The next day, the king regains his health and develops a special liking for the cat, making it the apple of his court\u2019s eye. This creates jealousy among the women in the court and, at an opportune moment, they dumped the cat in a well outside the city. Now Babri Khan begins his exciting journey from out of the well to get back to the court; a journey full of wonders, from encountering aliens to solving the puzzle of an old blind mouse, and of course translating the language of cats to that of a talking parrot! \u201cThe Qajar Cat\u201d is the comic story of the condition of the Iranian people during the Qajar Era; the story of resistance against oppression by a cat!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame features<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1- A cheerful, comic story with great descriptive attractions and peculiar narrative conflicts<br/>\r\n2- More than 6 mini games and tens of environmental puzzles<br/>\r\n3- Lovely comic characters from the talking parrot to aliens, and of course to Mr. Giggle (talking frog)<br/>\r\n4- More than 30 backgrounds with distinct artworks and use of typographic technique to design the game setting<br/>\r\n5- 12 characters with comic, fascinating animations<br/>\r\n6- More than 8 minutes of 2D animation<br/>\r\n7- 15 minutes of engaging and exclusive traditional music<br/>\r\n8- More than 3 hours of gameplay", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e1025ab0824e67e39f59e6ce752ba226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RSK Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Strategy First"], "esrb_rating": null}
