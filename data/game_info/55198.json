{"id": 55198, "slug": "segasonic-the-hedgehog", "name": "SegaSonic the Hedgehog", "name_original": "SegaSonic the Hedgehog", "description": "<p>SegaSonic the Hedgehog is an isometric platform game developed and published by Sega. An arcade spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series, it follows Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel, who must escape an island after they are kidnapped by series antagonist Doctor Eggman. Players use a trackball to move the characters and escape the island as quickly as possible while dodging obstacles and collecting rings.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by Sega's arcade division, Sega AM3, and released exclusively in Japanese arcades in 1993. It received positive reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and Computer and Video Games, who praised its graphics and gameplay. However, the game has never been re-released; a port to Sega's 32X platform never materialized, and the game was cut from Sonic compilation release Sonic Gems Collection (2005) due to problems with replicating the game's trackball control system on a standard controller. Mighty and Ray have reappeared sparingly in the Sonic franchise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 62, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA 32X"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Sonic Team"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
