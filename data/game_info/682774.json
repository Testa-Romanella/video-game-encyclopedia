You've lost your cats! You know they love getting into your stuff, so you'll need to find them before they get into anything! Cat-tastrophe is a chill, short game of kitty hide and seek about going around the small house you now call home and finding your cats in all the different places they wait for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0</strong>I\u00a0don't have a Mac or a Linux, so I was unable to test if they work alright on those. It does work just fine on Windows, though. They probably won't have the game's icon, either.</p>\n\n<p>So this is my third game! As such, don't expect a whole lot from it in terms of quantity, but what's there, I'm happy about!\u00a0I\u00a0do have an idea of how I\u00a0can expand the game in the future, increasing the map size immensely and in turn, the hiding spots plus some other things. However, I\u00a0may decide to work on other projects in the end instead.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>Mouse - Camera<br/>Left Mouse Button - Collect cats<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Shift - Crouch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:50:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/646efa9af60b7fe879c67b70a48d31fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bennnperson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
