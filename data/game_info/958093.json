The game is still in a very early development phase and far from final. So far the first level \"Chapter 1\" is playable. The current upload serves as a test and serves to improve the game. In the future, this will then be available in full and\u00a0 chargeable.</strong></p>\n<p>The gaming experience is unique after each restart due to a randomly generated game process and you can only discover many new jumpscares and elements after playing several times. The goal is to escape from the house, but this is made very difficult by a character that is chasing the player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3f1ecca686316ef420813f8c969a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CN Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
