Almost all assets used in the game, excluding the music used in the main game loop, were all made during the jam.\u00a0A video that tackles the process behind creating this game will be uploaded on Youtube on\u00a01 Bit Monster's\u00a0channel.\r\n</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Looks Can Be Deceiving.\" In this alternate version of 28 Seconds, you must find out why you got stuck in a simulation in the first place. You have to persevere to reach the very end of the simulation in a limited\u00a0amount of time\u00a0per room. You'll have 28 seconds to escape a room before the room blows up into oblivion. Make every second count.</p>\n<p>Try to accomplish the game in the fastest time possible! The timed mode is what the game was intended to be played by the get-go, but the untimed mode is present if in case the timed mode seems too hard.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the ending's music and sound effects were outsourced from other creators. The sound effect of the very last scene was taken from this website:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Nanakisan/sounds/204703/.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d7c702e3a22385da717fc6ae835cee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["1 Bit Monster"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
