You can start up by selecting your God and later, rule the stars according to your will, eventually leading to unbalance the order. <br/>You can work on divine journeys to gain epic possessions, fight with creatures to gain more power, fight with other gods and use possessions to feel your strength and make it felt by others.</p>\n<p>After reaching enough power, join Pantheon to share your intentions and strategies with your counterparts.</p>\n<p>Time shifts granted are of the utmost importance. Many events occur at that very moment. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Until doomsday, every god will shape the universe as to their wills. Their actions will be written in a myth. <br/>Not even a single mythological god is powerless. It's never too late to switch sides. Risk is ready to go beyond its familiar meaning. Do you trust your instincts? <br/>Gallant and Divine is awaiting you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81d055550cd020afa103710a3b37bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gadgame"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
