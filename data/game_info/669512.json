Unfortunately, I was unable to do everything I planned (finish the first level) and instead had to cobble together everything. I plan to eventually fix the UI, add music, and fully texture everything, as well as improve on the tutorials so it doesn't come across as me throwing all the mechanics at the player.</p><p>Play as Lyra Aerglo, an aspiring space adventurer as she happens upon an alien world that is subjugated by nefarious invaders! Jump, dash, and shoot your way through enemies and the planet itself to save the natives of this world and possibly the rest of the galaxy!!!</p><p>Planned features to add/fix:</p><p>-A shop system to spend money at.</p><p>-An options button and allow the player to adjust various settings for graphics, sounds, and possibly others.</p><p>-A simple inventory to store health, ammo, and timed power ups.</p><p>-Cutscenes, voice acting isn't a priority though. But in an ideal world, the game will have at least somewhat decent voice work.</p><p>-Side quests, there likely won't be too many, maybe only 20 at the absolute most, and ranging from mundane \"cut my weeds\" to \"kill this optional boss in this optional area\" though this is all a secondary priority.</p><p>-Expand upon the melee system, or at least make the basic melee attack feel more satisfying to use...</p><p>-Possibly more weapons for the player, I am still debating if this should be a more traditional metroidvania, or have the game be more straightforward but require specific skill-levels to access optional areas.</p><p>-A difficulty system, specifically a hard mode, though I may also build in an easy mode too, depending on how things work out.</p><p>-And to fix models, animations, sounds and clean up various scripts. This game was rushed after all, and I am certainly not proud of everything in it and do plan to make changes and clean things up.</p><p>This is definitely a projects I don't plan to stop anytime soon, though updates may be few and far between.</p><p>I hope you all enjoy it!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c6c00b9a34efa4172e623e85607c38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["armoraxis"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
