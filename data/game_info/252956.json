The \"tutorial\" doesn't explain all the aspects so here is a short\u00a0guide:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- At the start of a level you chose where to spawn\r\n  </p>\n<p>- in levels with time travel a timer will appear at the top. When the time is up, time will be turned back to the beginning,\u00a0with your actions saved as a ghost.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- You can interact with your ghosts: Stand on them, move them, and help them jump higher.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- You can manually turn back time with by pressing \"R\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>- If a ghost see you it will create a hole in the space time continuum and you will lose</p>\n<p>- When time is turned back you can choose to shoot a ghost, only a limited number of bullets is available.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- You can choose what way a player spawns by pressing \"A\" or \"D\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>Have fun!\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57875fc219863029e77563655f55074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tucanae"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
