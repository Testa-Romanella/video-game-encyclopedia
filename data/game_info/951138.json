A game about exploring an old mansion inhabited by a scientist who split open an artifact from the abyss unleashing monsters in the world! Recover the artifacts and use them to improve your gear.</p>\n<p>In this wave based survival game you can build points by killing monsters and spend those points to unlock doors to explore the mansion.</p>\n\n<p>For the future of this game I plan on adding more characters, improving the graphics (as I get better with 3d modeling) balancing the experience to not be too hard or too easy. But most importantly I plan on deep diving into UI/UX and overhauling it completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>check out the dev logs below if you want to keep up to date with my progress</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T19:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d0/6d0f2aff2f1ce979011b43b04dc271a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["solvit_sicario"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
