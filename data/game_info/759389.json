The theme was \"A Spark of Life\", so I decided to make a game where you create life with a spark!<br/></p>\n<p>A simple interactive experience where you just have to click to create little flocking trails called lifelets. You can customize the color, life span, trail length, and the max number of friends each one of them can have (which also has an effect on the strength of their flocking AI).</p>\n<p>Also if you right click, you can toggle whether or not the lifelets will have flocking AI. It works on an individual basis, meaning that if you right click to turn off flocking on the current lifelets, any new ones you make will still have it activated. And if you right click it again, the ones that do/don't flock with reverse.</p>\n<p>If you are playing the downloaded version, escape exits the game. Also does so with the web version but its less relevant.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:34:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/964/96405298713d5b3c74b202e37c84d5b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SpiderwebManor_Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
