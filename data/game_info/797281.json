It is my first game jam experience, big thanks to the GameDevTv for the opportunity.\u00a0All 3D models and textures are CC0 assets I found on the internet. I am not much of an artist. Attributes can be found on the GitHub page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are most welcome to leave a comment or write me directly on discord:\u00a0\u00a0aliyagmur#2677\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a coder to work with in the future game jams or other projects, we can talk about it. Although I have only recently started to learn Unity, I am spending\u00a0lots of time, geting better. I can probably code anything reasonable even if I don't know how, but it might take a bit longer to do so.</p>\n<p>Note: The code is a mess. I worked alone and didn't have the weekdays, so I rushed during the time I had. Even I don't know how the code works anymore.
