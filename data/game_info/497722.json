The topic was \"Airborne\". So I created a game about launching\u00a0a character in the air by rocket jumping. How high can you get?</p>\n<p>(No, there is no Reckless Rocket Ranger without Reloaded.

No engine or 3rd party libraries. Just me, TypeScript and the W3C web APIs.</p>\n<p>And I got to say: I am in love! Finally a sane way to create JavaScript. With proper IDE support like auto-complete and error checking while you type. Next time I create a web application, I will use TypeScript again. I just enjoy it so much more than vanilla JavaScript. It's exactly how JavaScript <em>should </em>work in my opinion.\u00a0And I can even keep using my whole web API knowledge.</p>\n<p>Regarding the game itself: I applied some advise from the last Game Maker's Toolkit video regarding extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Instead of giving the player one concrete goal (as I usually do), I just put them into a sandbox where I track some performance metrics the player might want to improve upon and inform them when they beat their personal best.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9b/a9bd61c9dd4d690d7a7c3cd410c3879c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhilippTheProgrammer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
