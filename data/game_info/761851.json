His brothers and older comrades: seconds, minutes and hours learn from this and are condemned for the fact that he is no longer like everyone else and cannot perform his function. They don't want to deal with the incomprehensible and just try to kill him. At first, small forces are used - seconds. When they fail, minutes and hours are connected, which are much stronger. Mr. Second at first just fights and hides from them. Then he finds the first gear, which reduces the time of his throwing back in time and gives him some new opportunities. That is, they make him more \"normal\" on the one hand, and stronger than before - on the other.\r\n  </p>\n<p>As a result, he gets the opportunity to become the same, that is, having collected all the gears, he can move without throwing back. But at the same time, he loses all the newly acquired opportunities. And if he re-triggers this deviation in himself with a throwback in time, then the abilities return. And he has already learned to use the throwback itself to his advantage. As a result, he decides to remain the same \"abnormal\", accepts it in himself.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c7656c3bda54e9f4e7daf4fcdc87e5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marvis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
