To do this, you will have the help of different guardians, while you increase your powers by choosing upgrade cards.<br/><br/><h3>Buy Guardians And Upgrade Them</h3>At the end of every turn, you can upgrade your guardian's damage and buy new ones.<br/><br/><h3>Choose Random Upgrade</h3>During each game, you will be able to choose random upgrades and unlock cards. These cards will let you buy new guardians or upgrade existing guardians giving them better damage, range, or new abilities.<br/><br/><h3>Plan Your Defenses</h3>Each guardian deals with certain types of enemies better than others. So every game you may have to consider whether to build up defenses in advance or to wait for new threats to emerge and adapt on the fly.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58ca81e431859e80a728bff2d814d3b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali A."], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ali A."], "esrb_rating": null}
