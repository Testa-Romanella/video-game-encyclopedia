It was released exclusively on the Super Famicom in 1997, late in the system&#39;s lifespan.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s story features a player-named protagonist who takes off to find his sister after she is taken by the Ocean folk. He is joined by Wokuu, a sapient flying creature that claims to be a transformed girl. The player moves around the world via a top-down perspective similar to The Legend of Zelda and the game switches to first-person view when talking to NPCs inside of buildings.</p>\n<p>Bushi Seiryuuden adopts a unique format for its combat. When attacked, the player enters a side-view screen full of enemies, and the player must fight them in a turn-based format with two characters: the swordsman protagonist, who attacks with sword and shield, and a flying creature called Wokuu, who can take on distant enemies and keep the swordsman afloat for brief spells.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T11:59:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/401/4014719155b93b15893e74c02c87f2b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Game Freak"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["T&E; Soft"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
