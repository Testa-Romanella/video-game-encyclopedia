As the title and theme would imply; the finish line is the bathroom. Unfortunately, players are faced with the same challenge one might face in this very situation in real life. Co-workers are chatty folks, and they will seize on any opportunity to fill players ears with their inane blatherings.  Players must use their abilities, power-up items and the layout of the office to make the great office crossing to find sanctuary in the porcelain palace.<br/><br/><strong>  The Pressure is On </strong><br/><br/>Of course, players can take it nice and slow if there isn\u2019t any pressure to get to the bathroom quickly. Unfortunately, there is pressure, lots of it.   Players will need to keep an eye on the Gastric Gauge which serves as a constant reminder of their impending needs. In addition to managing their dwindling time players will have to keep an eye on the Shame-o-Meter which displays how much attention Gus has accumulated on his journey through the office. Persistent from level to level, the Shame-O-Meter indicates how close the Human Resources department is to firing the player, so behave!<br/><br/><strong> Avoid Co-workers  </strong><br/><br/>As players talk to co-workers and navigate through their conversations time keeps on ticking. While avoiding co-workers is the first line of defense, some are bound to catch up and start a conversation. When the pressure is on and players have no time to spare they can bellow \u201cShut up!\u201d, \u201cTalk to the Hand!\u201d or any number of other rude dismissals that will allow them to avoid conversation. Of course, this doesn\u2019t go over well with HR and will rack up some shame on the Shame-O-Meter.<br/><br/><strong> Manage the Pressure  </strong><br/><br/>Pressure can be a real problem.  When the Gastric Gauge reaches its limit the unthinkable will happen. Avoiding this conclusion at all costs is the very core of the player's mission in Gotta Go. Thankfully, there are actions one can take to delay the relentless march of the pressure gauge. One such action is the tactical release of gaseous pressure. The fart.  Although this will allow players to reclaim some of their dwindling time it runs the risk of irritating co-workers who might file a report with HR or chase them down for a confrontation. <br/><br/><strong> Use Resources Wisely </strong><br/><br/>In addition to releasing clouds of noxious gas to forestall the inevitable, players can find power-ups like \u201cBipto-Pesmol\u201d to calm their tumultuous guts and further delay their doom. In addition to power-ups that calm the ailing stomach, players can find power-ups that repair their damaged reputation and  reduce the \u201cShame-O-Meter\u201d like the TPS report.<br/><br/><strong> Add Some Flavor to Your Playthrough </strong><br/><br/>Additionally, players will be able to modify difficulty levels and toggle a list of \u201ctopping\u201d options that will allow them to drastically change the way the game plays. These changes will require different strategies and change the scores received in arcade mode.  For example, adding the topping of \u201cOnions\u201d will make it easier to tell co-workers to shut up but will make it more costly on the Shame-O-Meter.<br/><br/><strong> Salvation or Soiled? </strong><br/><br/>Of course there are only two ways this ends, in silent success or a very public failure. Can you save Gus\u2019 pants or will they end up soiled?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10e194749025791760c15ed53b7cdd01.jpg", "website": "http://www.direnerdstudios.com/gottago", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dire Nerd Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dire Nerd Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
