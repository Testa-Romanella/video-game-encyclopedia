Yes, there isn't to much to do and it is VERY basic but I have found it very addicting. There are a ton of bugs that I have spent at least 5 hours trying to fix and will probably never be fixed. Controls are WASD and up, down,left, and right. esc. and 1-6 control your race track. If AI cars start driving at weird angles just restart the level.</p>\n<p>You'll probably need WinRar to extract the file.</p>\n<p>Sorry for having to pay 10 cents for a prototype that may never be fully developed but we are already developing more games!</p><p><strong>*<em>Sorry but this project has been cancelled!</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81da066bd567e35a44f792790d24b201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shyran Game Dev"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
