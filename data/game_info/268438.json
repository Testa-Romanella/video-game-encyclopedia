The Araucanos lived there peacefully for years, under the protection of the Pillanes. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis harmony was broken by northern invaders who wanted to extend their territory and civilization. They used their beliefs and weapons to race and burn the land.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe equilibrium between worlds was lost, so did the power of the Pillanes. They decided to shut themselves away to Sacred Lands and created Seven Sacred Tokens to close the gates to the Magic Lands. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe pact between the Araucanos y the Pillanes was sealed. The Araucanos chose to Caupolicano as their lonco to lead them against the invaders. But first Caupolicano needed to show his strength: he had to defeat Cai-Cai\u2019s daughter. The battle was fierce. Caupolicano was defeated and sent into an ice prison. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter being 10 years in a cold and dark cave, Caupolicano was made a slave by El ChonChon, a powerful wizard who defeated Cai-Cai\u00b4s daughter.
