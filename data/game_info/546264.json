The goal is to shoot the hexagons and destroy them. It's also possible to destroy the rocks in the world.\u00a0The amount of lives you have is determined by the number of bullets you shoot. You gain power-ups when you reach a higher score, and lose them when you take dmg.</p>\n<p>This is my first HTML build and the \"High Score UI\" messes\u00a0up if you don't play in fullscreen. I recommend downloading the game\u00a0since it looks better and performs better. But it works totally fine here in the browser so Good luck :D!</p>\n\n<p>**<strong>FUTURE UPDATE</strong>**\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"HighScore - Ui Fix\", \"Global HighScore list\", \"HealthUi\", \"Minor tweeks\", \"Ui that shows the next powerup score\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/0132602c7bbc8c72ea29ef08d7e096b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SeastarSwe"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
