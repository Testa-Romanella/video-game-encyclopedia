Once betrayed, now they're on a mission for revenge on their old gun slinger gang. But he needs your help. Before you do, why don't you sit down and warm yourself up with some moon dust tea from wise old Uncle Bronco (or don't, we've heard it tastes terrible). If Ranger helps Bronco out with some yard work and reparations, they can borrow his old spaceship to travel the galaxy. Are you up for the task, pardner?<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>- Travel the galaxy and meet an interesting bunch of characters</p>\n<p>- Solve mind-bendingly tricky puzzles. From yardwork to space basketball in a forgotten civilization, there's no telling what crazy tasks you will have to do. <br/></p>\n<p>- Use three physics-based weapons: the pistol curves around objects, the rifle bounces from one object to the next, and the grenade launcher... is fun. Use at your own discretion<br/></p>\n<p>Go and fix up Uncle Bronco's moon by using physics and the three guns at your disposal. Then launch yourself onto planet Polisand and find the power cores from an old civilisation to rebuild the ship. Jump, run, shoot and most importantly <em>think</em> in order for you to beat the game. <br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nMinimum Requirements: \r\n<p>- Ram: 16.0 GB<br/>- OS: Windows 10<br/>- Processor: Intel(R) Core (TM) i7 - 3820 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 3601 Mhz, 4 Core(s)<br/> - Storage: 980 MB<br/>- Graphics Card: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 Ti<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Who are we?
