This is my master project. my purpose is to explore the possibility of using interactive writing as a method to develop a narrative-based video game. The way I design it is to\u00a0write the script first and then develop the game based on the interactive writing. The script can also be downloaded below if you are interested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The story of which is made up, but the theme I think reflects a common family issue in reality. I believe you will get it if you have played the game. To be honest, the game itself is a very short interactive experience. I hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you don't mind, please spare a few minutes to help me answer a few choice questions. To answer them, I suggest you to play the game first, and then read the script. The questionnaire form is linked below:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/wxSvtuNwMnGvzahP9<br/></p>\n<p>Don't forget to leave your comments below, I would love to hear from you.\u00a0Thank you!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/33700ff747fe9486bfd70a7b94169156.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shaohua Yan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
