Big shoutout to Turbowarp because this project was developed entirely on Turbowarp. Without it, this project would've been a nightmare and a half to code. Credit to\u00a0@SpideyPlaysMC\u00a0for the list data I used for the Auto-aligning tiles, and also for most of the SMW assets. The rest of the SMW assets came from spriters resource.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Most assets belong to Nintendo and Mojang\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T20:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cce/ccefa3f98b56e5885154f62be3621c99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GamingWithDominic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
