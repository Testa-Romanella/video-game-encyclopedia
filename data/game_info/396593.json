It is based on the question: Which ideal from the Declaration of Independence is most important? In this 2 player space game, player 1 fights for natural rights and player 2 fights for the right to alter or abolish government.\u00a0 To get points, you must collect evidence that supports your cause. If you collect evidence that does not support your cause, you will lose some points and take damage to your ship. The first player to get 30 points wins. If you take too much damage to your ship, losing all three of your lives, you will lose. Good luck commanders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3f/a3f80ce6e6ce94ee3ae20561ef27e6b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IndieCoyote"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
