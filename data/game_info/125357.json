{"id": 125357, "slug": "defense-evolution", "name": "Defense: Evolution", "name_original": "Defense: Evolution", "description": "<p>Part tower defense, part RTS and part mathematical puzzle, \"Defense: Evolution\" is a minimalist game of territorial expansion and control that will engage you thanks to its simple yet deep strategical gameplay and high replayability factor.</p><p>Your task is to wisely place a limited number of red cells anywhere in the play-field with the purpose of protecting the \"beacon\" (green cells) by an upcoming invasion (blue cells). <br/>Each cell population can evolve and interact with others according to Conway's \"Game of Life\" set of mathematical rules, originating an unexpected yet rigorous action every time you play.</p><p>Unique features:</p><p>- High replayability: unpredictable outcomes, yet driven by a mathematically rigorous rule-set, make each new game different and unique.</p><p>- Sharpen your pattern recognition and strategic skills.</p><p>How to Play:</p><p>There are 3 types of cells: Red (you), Green (the \"Beacon\", those you have to protect. If they die, it's Game Over) and Blue (the Invaders). <br/>Each cell interacts with the others following these rules:</p><p>1. Any cell with fewer than 2 neighbours dies.</p><p>2. Any cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</p><p>3. 3 cells of the same kind next to an empty square will give birth to a new cell.</p><p>4. Any cell with more than 3 neighbors of a specific kind dies.</p><p>5. Beacon cells are particularly vulnerable to Invaders: two of them are enough to kill a nearby beacon cell!</p><p>Every turn, score is computed by adding the number of Red cells alive. <br/>Every turn, 1 extra Red cell is awarded for every 8 Beacon cells present. <br/>You can place or take back Red cells by touching the grid. Let them evolve and protect the Beacon! <br/>But pay attention: they can also harm the beacon if their evolution gets out of control!</p><p>Evolution can be halted and restarted at different speed (turn by turn or continuous) by touching \"Play\" and \"Fast Forward\" controls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb34048395a3c3cf3d72615f95b56ad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Adsumsoft"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
