They want to embrace the light yet they see them under different nights.</p>\n<p>When the same dream is reached through different means, that dream will be a nightmare. \r\n  </p>\n<p>It was Ylva who dreamt of peace between Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Undead and Orcs. Through the Words of God, she attempted to embrace the races to erase the differences. But, they turned a deaf ear. Turned she into the darkness in a hope to spark a light. She summoned Ragna, a demon dragon, to bring calamity to the World to force the races to hold each other\u2019s hands to bring an end to the calamity. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile on the remote corner of the World, a band of four from different races and a talking sword dreamt of the same peace. Yet they did not raise their pens nor swords to reach the dream. They helped anyone send a gift to their dearests. They built a courier company \u2013 the Zephyrsmith \u2013 as a bridge to connect the dearests. Could sending a gift end the war and bring peace to the World? Who would be able to reach that dream of peace? Those with power or those with heart?\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Game Producer &amp; Eventer: SF.
