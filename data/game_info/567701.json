The instruction page is filled.\u00a0</li><li>Three levels are designed with increasing difficulty. Level 1 only has stationary enemies. Level 2 added tracking enemies. Level 3 added a gravity effect for the play so that the users have to manage to keep balance when shooting.\u00a0</li><li>Aerolites are added in the middle of the scene. On one hand, the player can use the\u00a0aerolites to avoid the enemies' projectiles. On the other hand, the aerolites can also block the player to raise the difficulty. In Level3, the player can use aerolites to deal with gravity.\u00a0</li><li>An end scene is added. When a user succeeds in all three levels, the user will see the end scene.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Jackie007</p>\n<p>Final song provided by Taurus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e929b8a989b4d5e6ddd20aa69e0c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jackie007"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
