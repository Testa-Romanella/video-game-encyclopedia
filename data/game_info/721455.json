{"id": 721455, "slug": "unterlander", "name": "Unterlander", "name_original": "Unterlander", "description": "<p>A lander game where your perspective moves with the lander.<br/></p>\n<p>This game started as an idea for a mobile game, using the accelerometer and touch screen for controls. The idea was to make a lander game, but to steer the lander by turning your phone and accelerate by touching the screen. Even with debug controls (mouse for both steering and acceleration) the initial prototype was pretty fun.</p>\n<p>At some point, I decided I should make at least one \"full\" game, from initial prototype to launch trailer, and maybe this could be that game. I learned a lot in the process, and there's already so much I would do differently next time. Now I've worked on it long enough to be tired of looking at it, and I can't wait to move on to other projects. The FFS jam is just another good reason to put a bow on it.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T05:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40ddc1d462aa5bbeab2382f1e51ffd74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phlp"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
