This is due to the fact that apple refuses to implement OpenGL properly for GL3, which I am unable to fix. Therefore, there is a separate compilation of the game using a different renderer which breaks some things like the water, but is fundamentally the same game.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally, if you are NOT a mac user but your system/browser isn't supporting OpenGL3, this version will also work for you.</p>\n<p>Check it out here:</p>\n<p>https://colbydg.itch.io/redneck-fishin-mac-compatible</p>\n\r\nOverview\r\n<p>Redneck Fishin' is a satirical duck-hunt style game, where you are a rural fisherman who uses his trusty double-barrel shotgun instead of a typical fishing pole to catch the most elusive flying Feesh Flounder, Beer fish, and the rare Zeusfish!</p>\n<p>This game is a collaboration project for the 16th Lame Jam, 4/10/2022.<br/><br/></p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Game play is fairly simple, as the player you right-click to aim the shotgun, and left click to shoot. Additionally, powerups can be collected which are automatically cashed for points at the end of the timer. The beer cans can be drank for a fully-automatic burst by pressing the \"1\" key on the keyboard. Car batteries can be used to shock a whole bunch of fish in the water by pressing \"2\". These items are collected from special fish that spawn, such as car batteries from the Zeusfish.\u00a0</p>\r\nDevelopment News\r\n<p>There are still a few lacking features that I plan on implementing, such as the grenades.\u00a0 Currently, this will only happen if time allows, since this game was made for a jam, it may remain as-is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce3ca27ffb1db5839702726aa5f874d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Colbydg", "Ornsteiner", "patrykvv", "meleageraudio", "TheFatPeanut"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
