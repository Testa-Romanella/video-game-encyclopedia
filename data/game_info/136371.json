While scientists don't know what happened yet, they do know that you are up a celestial creek without a paddle!  <br/><br/>Your pretty green rock is headed into an asteroid field.  Attempts to clear a path have used up all but one of the Asteroid Shooting Shells (A.S.S). <br/><br/>It is your job to pilot your Surface Protecting Asteroid Neutralisation Craft (S.P.A.N.C) and shoot down the asteroids before they destroy your world completely.  The only trouble is you've only got one A.S.S. so you're going to have to keep picking it back up, and try not to fire it out of orbit!<br/> <br/><strong>CONTROLS  </strong><br/><br/>[A] + [D] - Move the S.P.A.N.C. <br/>[LMB] - Launch A.S.S.<br/>[MOUSE] -Aim<br/><br/><strong>TIPS</strong><br/><br/>* Hitting multiple asteroids with one shot scores a lot more points.  <br/>* The longer your A.S.S. is in the air, the more points you'll score.  <br/>* Don't forget to pick your A.S.S. back up!</p><p><strong>DONATIONWARE</strong></p><p>I didn't make this silly little game to make money. I made it for the fun and the practice (and I had a strange urge to make a game called 'BOOB') and actually, it's turned out to be a nice little game. So I'm giving it away to anyone who wants it.\u00a0 You can have it for nothing.</p><p>That said, I'd like it if you paid me something for it. I'm not going to make you, obviously, but if you like the game or fancy helping out a little developer like me, chuck some spare change into my virtual hat. Don't feel obliged by any means but I'd appreciate it if you did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2aa/2aa44f3b9647f1a47f57155cbca3c59e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dr_wombat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
