I used Sunny Land assets (by Ansimuz) and You Tuber\u2019s Brackeys character controller script to create my game. It was a good experience to learn to work with layers and tilemaps, analyze and expand another person\u2019s script as it made things much more difficult than writing everything from beginning.</p>\n<p>It was a challenge to make the climbing mechanic because of physics. The rigidbody component\u2019s gravity accelerates making it impossible for my character to climb high. To fix this I first tried increasing climbing, but eventually fixed it by disabling gravity on crouching and climbing with Booleans.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Features:<br/>\u00b7 Interactions (lever that builds bridge, door, traps)<br/>\u00b7 Options and Main Menu screens.<br/>\u00b7 Climbing mechanic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78aaf483cd97bee2fe241567430a9662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roocktopus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
