{"id": 692551, "slug": "bunny-dance", "name": "Bunny Dance", "name_original": "Bunny Dance", "description": "Bunny Dance is a completely new product , I don't know should be call it a game or entertainment app. Maybe you know Miku Miku Dance (MMD) a software to create music videos. Bunny Dance is like MMD but it can create a music video faster and easier.<br/><br/>Gamer can open the song and watch character animation with light effects as a perfect<strong> audio visualization</strong>. In the short term , this product is too new yet in the market, I need comments from the community before continuing to develop it to the next stage of project. The first version will focus on playing music and Workshop systems, dance animation and camera motion will be random . So , you probably will feel sometimes the character animation not match the song but in the future , i will develop a system that helps gamers can be edit dancer animation so it will completely match 100% with the song.<br/><br/>Currently Bunny Dance supports play direct music song from YouTube ... but other website you can contact me for support . But i am not sure entire website can play music with Bunny dance.<br/>Bunny dance successfully or failed depends entirely into the community, we will support the best platforms for the gamers community to create innovation and create quality mod games in the future<br/><br/>Thank you", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T02:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f1428528adceabe0f62f2df5f95bb919.jpg", "website": "http://eastfog.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["EastFog Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EastFog Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
