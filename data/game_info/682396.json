{"id": 682396, "slug": "second-order", "name": "second order", "name_original": "second order", "description": "<p>This is 'second order', a new video game from Outhouse Media. This is a new type of shmup, but it doesn't fit the accepted genre concept. I'm not saying that it's not 'fun' and 'flappy', because it is fun and flappy-like, but it's not 'fun' and 'flappy', and for the same reason.<br/>\nThe game is Dead Snap Jump, a mini-game where you jump, and when you stop, you start over with a new jumped position. You try to get as close as you can to the start location, before your speed drops and you crash to the ground.\n\nPlayers have to jump from platform to platform and land with as much speed as possible. The goal is to reach the final platform. Outhouse Media is a software developer, and this is their debut project, so there are a lot of things to work on. I'm looking forward to trying it out.\n\nA big question for me is: is it good? I think that it's definitely not great, and I think that there are definitely some annoying things about it. Novelty, no strategy, no aiming, etc.\n\nWhat kind of music are they playing?\n\nNoob:\n\nYeah, noob. I didn't expect much from there. Anyway, I like the soundtrack, so I'll try to write my own. Maybe an only-lame song that would be sung the same way as the TV coverage game.\n\nYou</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bff6dfa0a1d6722af229ffb2d557ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
