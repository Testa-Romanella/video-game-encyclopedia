Start with a few logical symbols and rules and then build your way up to fiendishly complex mathematical machines.<br/></p><p>The enemy blockade has cut off the port and the people of your city are starving. A pirate queen and newly-made admiral has given you an important task-- defeat the enemy code and break the blockade.</p><p><em>Calculation</em> features 19 puzzles with no written rules. You must learn the language of the strange symbols to accomplish your task.</p><p>While I consider the game to be complete, if enough people are interested, I will expand it into a longer and more varied game.</p><p>[There is a Linux version, but I have not actually tested it.
