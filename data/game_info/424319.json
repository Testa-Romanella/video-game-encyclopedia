A marvelous piece of interactive entertainment the likes of which the world has never seen before. A game so wonderful that it removes the need for anyone to create any game for the rest of eternity because there is no way that anything that comes after this could possibly live up to it. This game has redefined art and it is now mandated that anyone who is/has majored in art must now start over from the beginning so that they can learn that definition. Art is no longer subjective. This is art. Prepare to be challenged to your physical and mental limits as you have to consider every possible perspective of what brought all of us to this moment. This is the culmination of all things. There is no more war. There is no more famine. There is only this game. And a lot of pestilence. Fuck, there's A LOT of pestilence.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/9781c7ae99707205af3e9506bef8227f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrentonLenzen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
