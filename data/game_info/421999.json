Help guide Jetpack Cat away from a dangerous planet full of deadly robot aliens. If you're lucky, Jetpack Cat might even reach outer space!</p>\n<p>Jetpack Cat was originally released worldwide on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store in\u00a02014. Years later, after I closed Make or Break Games to join Owlchemy Labs, I could no longer prioritize supporting it. Rather than losing it to history, I'm uploading my first professional game here.</p>\n<p>This is the Android version, so you'll need either an Android device or an emulator (I like BlueStacks) to play. The real-money store and social media functions will not work, of course.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T03:08:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66a338664918e3b02dff938352842709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mike Leach"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
