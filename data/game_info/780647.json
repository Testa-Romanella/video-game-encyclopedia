Money can be used to upgrade your car to make it move faster, it is also actively used up as you use the boost function.</p>\n<p>You also need to maintain your fuel, there are canisters scattered around and a fuel station that will fill you up for free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently the point of the game is to try get as much money as possible so you can drive faster and get money faster, it's surprisingly relaxing just going around and dropping off the capsules.</p>\n\n<p>I'm developing this to be more of a zombie horde destruction game, so new updates to come soon!</p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER: Many of the 3D assets are not made by me, they are from a free asset on the Unity Asset store.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the record, I am capable of making 3D models of at least this caliber, but the original project was time restrictive so I used free assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T12:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/125bf5b953db9d631d479a5f3e165a50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MajorHobo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
