Along the way he encounters the many bizarre residents of the town, including (but not limited to) a failed wizard whose far-more-successful wife hates him, a group of mischievous monkeys that appear to be hiding more than meets the eye, a cabal of police officers who might be an evolved form of fungus, and to top it all off, a strange talking gun named Concord \u2013 who also happens to be the only person interested in helping James find his brother.\r\n  </p>\n<p>While Nowhere may appear harmless (or even comedic at times), under the surface lies never-before-seen threats\u2026 Strange lifeforms brought to this earth and animated by forces beyond human comprehension seek to stop James in his tracks for their own mysterious reasons\u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>With a town as chaotic and nonsensical as Nowhere, you can only trust your wits \u2013 and your talking gun \u2013 to survive.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<br/>\n<ul> <li><strong>A surreal      PSX aesthetic </strong>evocative of Lilith Zone\u2019s \u201c<em>Crypt Worlds</em>.\u201d\r\n  </li><li><strong>Wonderful alt-rock soundtrack</strong>\u00a0composed by the likes of Monplaisir and Patrick Kilpatrick.\r\n  </li><li><strong>Metroid-vania      gameplay</strong> where the player augments their body with surrogates \u2013      supernatural entities that need a human host to function \u2013 in order to dive      deeper into the game world.\r\n  </li><li><strong>An      earnest story about a broken family, and an older brother\u2019s adventure</strong> \u2013 with      a sentient revolver \u2013 to find his missing younger brother in the      mysterious town of Nowhere, MI.\r\n  </li><li><strong>Various abilities      can be further augmented</strong> by collecting upgrades strewn about the world.\r\n  </li><li><strong>A cast of      ridiculous characters to meet and quest for.</strong> Have you ever wanted to visit      an incompetent old wizard and give him a chocolate bar so delicious it causes      him to have a stroke?
