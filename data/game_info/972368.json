Then tragedy struck, and you washed up on the shores on Illyria, a mysterious island that seemingly co-exists with the anomaly that befell your group. The locals seem friendly enough, even though there is a brewing conflict between the mages and the monarchy. How will you settle into your new (temporary?) home? Will you cool old rivalries, start new romances, make new friends, and maybe even possibly figure out the origin of the giant gaping hole in the ocean? <br/><br/>Because there's a giant gaping hole in the ocean.
