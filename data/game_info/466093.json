Now the trigger is stuck and you've got to wrangle a run-away laser and try to get to a safe place to dispose of it\u00a0without melting your entire office.</p>\n<p>Hey y'all, I hope you enjoy this prototype. This is my first jam game, and it was a great learning experience. I'm sad that I only got one level done in time, but I'll probably keep puttering on this one. Let me know what you all like and what you didn't like.</p>\n<p>By the way, you can adjust the difficulty up and down by messing with the recoil slider in the options.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6b87d8513de7cd8126e06820824878.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Private Butts"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
