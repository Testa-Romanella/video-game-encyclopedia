In this game, the player controls a bird, attempting to escape by flying between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player clicks the left mouse button. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T10:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46f0866bfaca7f0ada8bc4c26dbdd5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SubhjeetTiwari"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
