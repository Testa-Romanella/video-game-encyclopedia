A horror game that takes place within the halls of The University of Baltimore, Horrific Halls uses sounds and environmental disturbances to rattle the player. Wandering monsters and possessed spirits roam the halls, guarding their home from intruders.</p>\n<p>When waking up after sleeping through class, the student finds themselves locked in their classroom, only everyone has left the building. The lights are off, the doors are shut, and the only signs of life are the demons and creatures that roam the halls at night. Using the environment to hide, distract, and run from the monsters, the student must find their way out of the labyrinth of unholy-horrors.</p>\n\n<p>Revee Watts \u2013 Coding, Production</p>\n<p>Adam Mizell \u2013 Coding, Interface, Video Capture, Interactions</p>\n<p>Nathan Dupree \u2013 Monster Art, Level Creation</p>\n<p>Gary Keeler\u00a0\u2013 3D Models, Level Design, Story, Sound</p>\n<p>Chris Rizzo \u2013 Filters, Environmental Design, Textures</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac2a34f690eb3ae20c715b83061c1f8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdamMizell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
