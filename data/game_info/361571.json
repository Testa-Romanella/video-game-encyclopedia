However, the evil blobs have other ideas. Kill the blobs to vanquish evil and to get back to what you were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>To propel around/shoot your multi-tool:</p>\n<p>1.Press a key to make your multi-tool rotate clockwise around you.</p>\n<p>2.Press another key when it is at the desired angle (YOU WILL GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE MULTI-TOOL).</p>\n<p>3.Smash your keys to get more speed (Shown above your character in green). You have a limited time to do this (Shown above your character in blue).</p>\n<p>4.The multi-tool will shoot out and you will go in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>5.The multi-tool will then return. During this small period, you are unable to shoot it (since you don't have it).</p>\n<p>Walls stop blobs from getting to you, but also means you can't shoot them.</p>\n<p>Blobs will go towards you, and harm you when they touch you. They each have their own hp, which goes down if they are shot by the of the multi-tool. The amount of damage is relative to the speed of the multi-tool.</p>\n<p>You lose when you are out of hp. Your score is based on your kills.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical thing</strong></p>\n<p>Because of issues with my computer, this game was made on a raspberry pi. Therefore, I had to make it using python(pygame). This means that not only is it bad, but\u00a0there is also no web-playable version, so you need to download it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbe16a9e3ad51e8c1c8799d92a9873be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rat-like"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
