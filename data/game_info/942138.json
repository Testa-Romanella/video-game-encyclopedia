It's time to take matters into your own hands and wipe them out forevermore.\r\n<p>Lich's Revenge is a short action game where you play as a Lich with a moveset suited for ranged combat. Lich's Revenge is also a game created to be a University Final Year Project about:<br/><strong>'Discerning what constitutes as \u201cfairness\u201d in video game design and how it makes for a more fun experience.'</strong></p>\n<p>If you found this game via itch and have played it, please consider filling in the survey below. It shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes, does not collect any sensitive information, and will greatly assist me with my project. The survey will ask questions regarding: your general video game experience, the main game, and the scenarios (from the 'Scenarios' menu option).<br/>https://forms.gle/YU36wHopfd3VeUXeA<br/></p>\n<p>There are two versions of the game available for download: version A and version B. These are related to the above survey. Version B allows you to modify the difficulty to your liking, while Version A has a set difficulty level. Depending on which version you played, you will be asked a seperate set of question in the survey. If you choose to play Version B then try to alter the difficulty to your liking and keep track of what you changed.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has an optional story that's not relevant to the survey. When starting the game you will have the option to play the game with/without it. If you play the game with the story it has an average playtime of 30-45 minutes.
