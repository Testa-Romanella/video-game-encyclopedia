The child is the oldest sibling in\u00a0the family and the adult are occupied by other things, so the player character is sent out\u00a0to find water. Water scarcity is a big problem in several areas of the world and are in\u00a0many cases a direct result of conflicts. For many people, getting access to water by\u00a0fetching it outside is a matter between life and death. We want to bring this issue\u00a0forward by having a game where you must walk around as a child and fetch water in a\u00a0dangerous environment.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone at team Task Trolls at NORD University during the 3rd semester ro reach the current state of the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a19f32c4dd001779e26c19e066edebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["FroztySeven"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
