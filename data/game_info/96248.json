I don\u2019t think I quite got the \u201cfarming simulator\u201d part of it clear though, mostly just the platform runner. But hopefully you enjoy it anyway!</p>\n\r\nGAME\u00a0\r\n<p>You play as Tabitha McBain, who has been too lazy playing videogames and has only 3 days left until she needs to fill the produce truck to sell her goods! While making coffee, she notices next to the sugar a conveniently placed jar of cocaine. She puts it in her coffee instead of sugar to give her the extra \u201cbuzz\u201d needed to get all her work done in time!</p>\n\r\nGOAL\u00a0\r\n<p>This game is super easy if you don\u2019t care about what score you get at the end. You can complete the game to the end without collecting a single item, so long as you don\u2019t hit a crate and get rekt. But\u2026you\u2019ll only get 1/5 stars!</p>\n<p>If you hit a crate - you get sent all the way back to the beginning of level one! Harsh, but I think it makes for a fun challenge. Also this was just easier to code in the short time frame so that I could spend more time on the art!</p>\n<p><em>Can you get 5 stars?? Show me a screencap if you do!</em>\u00a0</p>\n\r\nTOOLS\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Game Maker Studio 2 Pro</li><li>Photoshop CC</li><li>Pyxel Edit</li><li>Coffee (<em>NOT cocaine!</em>)</li></ul>\r\nBUG FIXES\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Accidentally deleted one of the crops, resulting in nobody being able to get 5 stars. Oops! FIXED.</li><li>Fixed problem with score not resetting after the game ends.</li><li>Fixed grass parallax issue.</li><li>Fixed jump issue A BIT.</li><li>Quickly added credits to menu, whoops. Forgot those!</li><li>Improved tutorial image to make the controls clearer.</li></ul>\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>I have improved the jump in comparison to when I first submitted (where it was impossibly hard), but it seems to still be very hard and I need to work on my jump physics and timing in the future.</li><li>I am aware that I should have checkpoints for each level instead of going back to day one, but I ran out of time to code this and I think it would be unfair for me to go back in and add this now.</li></ul>\n<p>But thankyou all for the feedback on these issues!\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0https://www.goattoastergames.com/\r\n\u00a0<p>https://twitter.com/Goat_Toaster</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c9f9a0b8270aae18aa9bec132cbe15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goat Toaster Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
