However, this is what I could do in the time allotted. I took the theme in a more straightforward manner. Basically you are an astronaut in space during a meteor shower, your goal is to survive and the platforms you stand on are limited. You get points for walking on as many tiles as you can. Also there is a chance to find coins, which in turn give you more points. The objective is just to score as high as possible. Meteors are randomly generated to destroy the only platforms you have to stand on! You may jump from platform to platform, in hopes to survive the waves of flaming meteors!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b94/b9481a2290f58662bab6e15b069e5ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LongBrotherStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
