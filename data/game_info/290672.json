{"id": 290672, "slug": "stellar-nomad", "name": "Stellar Nomad", "name_original": "Stellar Nomad", "description": "<p>A top down 2D space trader/action RPG/sandbox, focused on creating a unique experience for each player, with changes in the galactic economy and overall balance of power being driven heavily by player action. Join an existing faction and turn the tide of the ongoing war, or start your own and make a push for galactic dominance. Be a smuggler, a bounty hunter, a peaceful trader, or a seasoned military officer - or anywhere in between!</p>\n<p>Inspired heavily by games like Elite and the classic Escape Velocity series.</p>\n<p><strong>What to expect in the demo:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is just a slice of what the final game will be, and it's almost entirely devoid of story right now. I've been working very hard to get the sandbox elements working correctly, and I'm pleased with the progress. But you will find bugs, you will experience unbalanced progression, and you will experience combat that's overly difficult at the moment. All that being said, I still feel like this is a pretty good representation of what I want the game to be.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next for Stellar Nomad?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'm glad you asked! I'll\u00a0 be supporting this version (bugfixes mostly) for a short time, then continuing on towards the early access release version of the game. The demo will stay available! I'll be adding hundreds of star systems, dozens more ships and weapons, and more generated mission types.\u00a0There's also quite a few features planned, like fleet morale, and officers you can hire onto your ships to give them certain bonuses in combat, trading, or a variety of other perks. There's tons of UI functionality and refinement to be done as well.</p>\n<p>Donate if you want, but don't feel obligated - I'd rather you just played the game!</p>\n<p><strong>If you are experiencing terrible framerates in some systems, go to the options menu and disable nebulas. I'm working on a more performant way to do them but for now, just turn 'em off.</strong></p>\n<p>Control remapping and gamepads are not yet supported but both are planned, hang tight!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/ced3ab22fdab0830e81daabe9cf7c8e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["imaginaryrobot"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
