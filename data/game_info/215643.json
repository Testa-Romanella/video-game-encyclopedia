Boofhead is on a quest to get to the nearest body of water as fast as possible.</p>\r\nGMTK Game Jam\r\n<p>This game was built for the 2018 48 hour GMTK Game Jam. All code and assets excluding those listed in the credits where constructed during the timeframe.</p>\n<p>Our submission features\u00a0<strong>Adventure</strong> without\u00a0<strong>Stopping</strong> - the character must move at all times - Releasing a movement key has little effect on whether the character stops. Instead,\u00a0 Boofhead will continue in the direction he was sent until he hits a wall, causing damage.</p>\n<p>This fundamental shift spread to all parts of the game mechanics during development, with health tied to movement speed directly, so that players taking advantage of momentum and \"flow\" can survive the level with a higher score and therefore \"health\".</p>\n<p>This is our team's first game jam, and first game in general. We assembled on the day and built something that we're pretty proud of, combining programming, art and music design skills.\u00a0There is a fairly large amount of content unreleased that we believe\u00a0could be developed further.</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n\r\nMove around using the\u00a0W,S,A,D keys.\u00a0Water coolers will replenish your health, and hitting bushes or obstacles\u00a0will hurt.\r\n<br/>Keep an eye on this meter (your health) lest you burn up:\u00a0<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12f2b3a0785435e1ac2f8b9e2c89244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["UoA ENG Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
