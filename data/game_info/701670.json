This is our second project, which we developed for the <em>Lost Cartridge Jam 2021</em> .</p>\n<p>In this virtual world, you are a boy (or a girl) seeking to recycle all garbage in town. For that mission, you need to walk around with your three hammers and make sure you hit every single piece of garbage and enemy that you find with the suitable hammer (yellow for plastic waste, green for glass, blue for paper).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to navigate through the menu:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the space bar to start to access the menu</p>\n<p>\u2022 Use A and D to move horizontally and choose your level</p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the space bar again to load the level and start playing! :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the A and D keys to move left and right.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the W key to jump</p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the Q key to change your hammer selection\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Press the E key to attack\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this game, and following the requirements of the jam, we have decided to adapt our game proposal as if it had been released for the Game Boy Color console, being, thus, characterised by its 4:3 screen, 8x8 four-colour sprites, and 8-bit sounds and background music. For us, Frog&amp;Panda, this kind of aesthetics and gameplay bring us to our childhood memories with the utmost nostalgia, and it has meant a means of conveying ideas that are timeless, such as recycling, in a way that takes us back in time to the 90s like a time capsule.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we wanted to take the opportunity of this jam to spread awareness on the importance of recycling to protect the environment and our beautiful planet. We hope that you like our game and that you share it with your friends, family, and on your social networks. Everyone needs a reminder on the life-changing habit that recycling impersonates!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :)\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Frog&amp;Panda<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a43168a10d713553b1fec7bf492942bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frog & Panda"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
