You have managed to configure the ship on automatic but you have a very limited amount of fuel.  You will be forced to make several well timed jumps to make it home before your fuel runs out.  In order to survive you will need to upgrade the\"automatic\" configuration of your ship in order to defend it against the aliens that may lie between you and home.<br/><br/>Galactic Solo Command is now available in 11 languages! English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean and Simplified Chinese. <br/><br/>In Galactic Solo Command you experience the atmosphere of running a spaceship while trying to return home after the crew has mysteriously disappeared. It's a very dangerous trip, with every jump presenting a challenge with life or death decisions. What will you upgrade first?<br/><br/>System Include: Auto-Pilot, Sensors, Shields, Medical, Doors, Weapons, Life Support and Engineering.<br/><br/>Your weapon system provides greater offense and will eliminate the enemy ships more efficiently.  However, perhaps you should upgrade the shields in order to stop the enemy barrage. Preventing the enemy from damaging your ships system will be critical because you will begin to lose your precious configurations while the systems are down.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>The upgrades will require more power and if you overload the system you can expect bad things to happen to your ship.  All the while knowing that the enemy will attempt to board your ship and kill you so they can take home this prize.  This \"spaceship simulation\" allows you to take your ship on a perilous trip to get home.  With ever increasing difficulty you should be prepared for the worst.
