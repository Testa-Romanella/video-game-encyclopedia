Some of you manage to swim to the island (16 of you). There is nothing in the island left to do, so you decide to spend your last hours playing a deadly game:\u00a0<strong>see who is the one\u00a0to last!!!</strong></p>\n<p>Island Royale is a 2D\u00a0Battle Royale game <strong>prototype</strong> made for Mini Jam 50:\u00a0Islands.</p>\n<p>Play with your mouse!</p>\n<ul><li>Right-click on the spot you want to move to.</li><li>Left-click to pick up anything on the floor.</li><li>Left-click again to throw that object at an enemy.</li></ul>\n<p>Beware, you need to stay within the safe zones! Safe zones will gradually become smaller and be marked with a red circle. If you are outside the safe zone, your health will decrease! Get inside the circles fast!</p>\n<p>Tip:\u00a0if you are outside the safe zone.\u00a0you can look at the small bar below your healthbar to check how far away from the circle you are.</p>\n<p>Try to beat everyone and die last!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Why is this a prototype?\u00a0\u00a0This game currently has a very rudimentary (random) AI (yet). <strong>The AI will not attack you for the moment or do any special stuff - it is currently only randomly moving in order to test the mechanics</strong>. Apart from that, there are many bugs to fix and additions to be made in the near future.</p>\n<p>If you ever get stuck or want to restart the game, simply press F1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/134ca9e73b7dc99944202fced7ab5216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["biyectivo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
