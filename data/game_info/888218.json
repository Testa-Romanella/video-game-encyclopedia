He is forced to face his two mightiest enemies, a neighborhood cat, and an annoying squirrel, to face the odds and get back what they\u2019ve taken and what he loves the most, a bright neon tennis ball. They\u2019ve come together and gathered a gang of other cats and squirrels to team up against Valentino. He has to face them all by himself, in order to redeem what he has lost.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:39:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d70fd0523f252261d900f681f413d50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oliviaparamo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
