It is a direct sequel to the first Quake game.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In the distant future, an alien race of Stroggs attack human colonies. As a result, humanity develops operation Overlord as a countermeasure and launches a counter-attack at the Strogg homeworld called Stroggos. The main objective of the soldiers is to close down the portal, which is used by Stroggs to teleport their armies on Earth. The operation does not go as smooth as planned and Bitterman, the main protagonist, is the sole survivor of his squad. He must finish the mission.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Quake II is an iconic first-person shooter. There are no health regeneration or weapon reloading systems present in the game. Instead, the players have to pick up health kits, ammo packs, and scavenge ammo from the dead Stroggs. </p>\n<p>As the game progresses, more strong Stroggs appear, their numbers rise, and these aliens become much more accurate. More types of Stroggs also appear, such as the medics, that can revive their fallen comrades.</p>\n<p>The game features 36 levels with the addition of three secret ones. Secrets are hidden on all levels, which contain useful items within them, such as a Quad Damage special boost. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Quake II&#39;s multiplayer was one of the first games to be recognized as a competitive discipline. Several modes are present: Free-For-All deathmatch, co-op, Capture the Flag, and Duel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T11:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0c5/0c5fcdf04048200da14b90e0e6cfaf6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.18, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 96, "owned": 1823, "beaten": 337, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 136, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 400, "suggestions_count": 501, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 404, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Linux", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["id Software", "Hyperion Entertainment", "Logicware", "Soundelux", "HammerHead"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "Activision Blizzard", "Activison", "Activision Value Publishing", "id Software", "Empire Interactive", "Tec Toy"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
