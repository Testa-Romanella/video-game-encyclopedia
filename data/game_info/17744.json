Rent asunder by deceit and betrayal, the land cries out for a peace that only four united heroes can bring.<br />\nBeyond the protective walls of Illumina Castle lie miles of pastoral, rolling countryside, though once a serene landscape, the Aklorian forces have transformed the countryside into a charred battlefield. Simply passing through the region is unsafe, as travellers must be ever alert for ambushes.<br />\nFour friends have joined together to aid their queen. Though destined to encounter ancient gods, primordial wonders, and marvellous inventions, foes and betrayal haunt their every step. A keen eye could prove vital, exposing essential clues. And as the companions make their way through darkness and light, they\u2019ll discover that those two extremes have more in common than they once imagined...<br />\nReal-time, bone-crunching combat with incredible spells and combos.Control any one of the four champions at any time, and skip between them at will.Customise each character&#39;s armour, weapons and spells and evolve new powerful attacks.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2005-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T15:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5f3/5f3e3b02d402653dd1d54e3871e92c08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 480, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 28, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 64, "suggestions_count": 611, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 64, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Climax Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Climax Group"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
