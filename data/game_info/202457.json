The player gathers upgrades to boost their abilities. These abilities explore many classic action-platformer tropes such as wall jumping and double jumping. Beyond platforming, the player also has a select few attacks to deal with the various enemies in the game; these attacks can be upgraded as well, both in damage and range.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unique angle</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAt the beginning of each level, the player starts with no upgrades and must build up to the goal.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe upgrades allow more exploration and combat opportunities which are sometimes essential to a level's completion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A and D (or arrow keys) to move</li>\n<li>Space to Jump</li>\n<li>J to Dash/Hover</li>\n<li>i to punch </li>\n<li>O to kick</li>\n<li>Enter/Return to switch modes (requires certain upgrades)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Joypad Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joystick to move</li>\n<li>A to jump</li>\n<li>X to kick</li>\n<li>Y to punch</li>\n<li>Left bumper to Dash</li>\n<li>Right bumper to swtich modes (requires certain upgrades)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attacks can reflect projectiles</li>\n<li>Red boxes hurt, health at top left</li>\n<li>Some pillars can be destroyed with attacks</li>\n<li>\"Platform\" mode for standard platforming and wall jumping</li>\n<li>\"Flight\" mode replaces dash with hover, can move freely while hovering</li>\n<li>\"Roller\" mode speeds player up, makes controls more slippery, dash is also an invincible attack</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a2589b319d36d69f79c5b04e8a7819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cwaceto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
