I made all the assets present in this demo except for the pictures in frames and some art on a few book covers.\u00a0\u00a0It is not finished.</p>\n<p>At some point in development I tried to turn it into a escape room-like puzzle game, but\u00a0 found out I'm terrible at puzzle design and wasn't really enjoying it so I dropped it. Instead, what you will find is a relaxing first person experience about exploring a wizard's messy room with little interaction.</p>\n<p>It's not really optimised, you need an above-average PC to move this project, runs at 40fps using:<br/>Radeon RX 480<br/>i5 4690<br/>24GB RAM</p>\n<p>Check my\u00a0twitter and\u00a0tumblr if you want to see what else I'm up to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a10920ec766dff1091a2af73a150d69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wabbaboy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
