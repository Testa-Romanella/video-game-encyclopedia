Play as a sly time lord hired by wealthy individuals to test the flaws in their security, try to be unseen, and outwit the guards by anticipating their routes.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach the glowing blue portal located at the end of the hallways, while minimising the number of jumps you make, the usage of your powers, the number of guards who spot you and the time taken to reach it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD for movement, Space for powerful jumps, QER for (limited) time manipulation powers that affect your surroundings. Escape for pausing the game, and Mouse to look around.</p>\n<p>Please let me know of any bugs or improvements you'd like me to make, thanks for playing. I\u00a0plan to add more levels and a level selection screen after the game jam is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/059/059331b6db67b126a19de7726767eed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aolifu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
