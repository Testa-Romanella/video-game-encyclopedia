How are you doing today?\u00a0</p>\n<p> A: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I've been keeping busy lately with work and taking care of my home. It's important to me to keep a calm and orderly home, it makes me feel more at ease.\u00a0</p>\n<p> Q: That makes sense. I know a lot of people who feel the same way. Do you think that our need for a calm home is innate or something that we learn?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I'm not sure. I think it might be a bit of both. I know that I definitely feel more comfortable and relaxed in a calm environment. But I also think that we can learn to appreciate and value a calm home more as we grow older.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: I think you might be right. I know I certainly appreciate a calm home more now than I did when I was younger. Do you think that our need for a calm home is something that is universal?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I think it is. I think that no matter where we are from or what our culture is, we all appreciate a calm and orderly home. It's a place where we can relax and feel at ease.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: Why do you think that a calm home is so important to us?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I think it's important because it's a place where we can feel safe and secure. It's a place where we can relax and be ourselves. We all need a place like that in our lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: I completely agree. I think a calm home is a haven from the chaos of the world. Do you think that our need for a calm home is something that will never change?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I don't think so. I think that as long as there is chaos and turmoil in the world, we will always need a place to escape to that is calm and peaceful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: But don't you think that our need for a calm home is also a reflection of our own inner chaos?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: What do you mean?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: Well, maybe our need for a calm home is actually a way of trying to escape our own inner turmoil and chaos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I'm not sure. I think that our need for a calm home is just a way of trying to find some peace and stability in a chaotic world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: Why am I not asking about the game?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: I'm sorry, I don't understand.</p>\n\n\n<p>Donate:</p>\n<p>https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/secure/give-monthly-double-your-impact-...</p>\n<p>https://www.saintmonicasinhaiti.com/projects/soup-kitchen/</p>\n<p>https://help.rescue.org/donate?ms=ws_resq_top_nav_btn_fy22_NS_mmus_jul&amp;initialms...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T11:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e522a6969c8682eca386b7af6d66fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GLADITORYRED"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
