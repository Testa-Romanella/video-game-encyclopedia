Wake up as Durwood Champney, a sarcastic douche with a vendetta for early morning traffic and follow a true story that we made up.

A bit like James Bond without all the coolness and classiness.<br/><br/>Wield powerful top of the line second-hand gadgets from the innovative Tomato Gun to the more sophisticated Sniffer. With inspiration drawn from real life, fake life and artificial life we bring to life the weirdest, wackiest and socially awkward characters.
