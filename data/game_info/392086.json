Problem is, the path is broken in several places!\nTo ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged.\n\u00a0\nSeems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required!\n\u00a0\nYou just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.\n\u00a0\nBear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges.
