A design school based in\u00a0Wellington, New Zealand. Throughout the development process, many\u00a0challenges were encountered, however we were all determined to continue with the project in order to publish a product that many people would have a good time with. When deciding on what direction to take the game\u00a0further, the team found great inspiration in\u00a0the games Overcooked and Fall Guys.\u00a0The former for its gameplay loop and general chaos, the latter for its movement.<br/></p>\n<p>All in all this project was a huge learning experience for the team and we look forward to hearing from players about any feedback or bugs you encounter so we can try improve it further!<br/>Finally, We the devs hope you all enjoy our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T19:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95b/95ba392669e2c094fb07227d66afb5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NZSol", "Filches", "Wyntermoon", "Sopaipipalta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
