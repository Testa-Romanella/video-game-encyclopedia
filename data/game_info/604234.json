None of these students are good enough to act in your masterpiece so you must drive them away.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each student will audition for you and after their performance you must figure out how to best insult them. You can select insults from three categories: acting, costume, and interests. The different types of insults will have a varying degree of effectiveness on each student. After you use an insult, you will not be able to use that insult again until the next round. Insult each student enough and they will leave the audition. Your goal is to convince all of the students to leave before the end of the third round.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145fb40770a93827f683b7c6432893f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TGS02"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
