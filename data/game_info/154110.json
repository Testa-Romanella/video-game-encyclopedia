When you start the level and time begins to fall, press Z to remove pixels with a wicked blast.</p><p>\n<strong>PixelTrox</strong> has 5 levels of increasing complexity, each with less time to remove pixels. If you play from the beginning, a portion of the remaining time of the previous level will be added to the current time, that way you will have more time to remove pixels.</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/913d5c65e2ba8f18e6aaa8100faf7a37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Espantapajaro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
