After receiving a private\r\nmilitary contract, the researchers at this lab are tasked with creating a\r\ndeadly<strong> parasite</strong> capable of controlling its host. This <strong>parasite</strong> can take control\r\nof humans, and transmit itself to others, and kill them from within. The\r\n<strong>parasite </strong>was developed without the ability to survive outside of a human host,\r\nperishing when exposed to the environment for too long.</p>\n<p>Disaster strikes this research facility as the <strong>parasite </strong>has\r\ntransmitted itself into an unsuspecting host and is escaping containment. The\r\nfacility has deployed their top security agent, a <strong>Doomtrooper</strong>, and ordered them\r\nto hunt and exterminate the <strong>parasite</strong>. The <strong>Doomtrooper </strong>has a specially designed\r\narmour that prevents the <strong>parasite </strong>from infecting the wearer, at the cost of\r\npenalties to their field of vision and movement.</p>\n<p>The Thingy is a Two player head-to-head\r\ncompetitive game in which player one controls the guard and is tasked with\r\nhunting down and eliminating player two; An intelligent <strong>parasite </strong>which\r\ntransmits itself from host to host in an attempt to escape the research lab.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38d351211c1b0154219fb6939f033e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hexterion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
