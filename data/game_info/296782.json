Life set me back a lot, and I'll admit the theme was not well covered. Plans were levels themed after the colors of the rainbow, with seven in the order of OYGBIVR\u00a0(Great Wastes, Searing sands, Emerald plateau, Cerulean cavern, Indigo Trench, Deep valley, Ember Core, and the secret Silicon Spectrum). Level designs are to be simple, with finding the weapon or powerup necessary to continue being the only objective (E.G double jump module). If I had more time I planned to implement colored enemies that took more damage when using a weapon dissimilar to the color. Only shield pickups are implemented, with ammo and health pickups planned.<br/></p>\n<p> I plan on continuing to work on it, so check back in for updates now and then.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fab56a94f6c0949f53ac2deb5c3a7f44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["seacowhero1492"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
