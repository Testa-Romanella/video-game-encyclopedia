The action takes place in Kalkanus Lambda, a distant solar system. Kalkanus Lambda 1, the only planet of the system suitable for life is inhabited by formerly peaceful creatures which built their civilization on sustainable technologies. When a mining corporation discovered a huge deposit of Iskisite (a rare mineral capable of producing high amounts of electricity when mixed with water) on desert planet Kalkanus Lambda 2, they first established their operations on that planet, leaving alone the neighbor civilization. However after a several months they discovered that once the Iskisite released all of its electricity, the process of recovering the water was extremely costly. With their water reserve exhausted, the former administration evaluated the situation and decided that the survival of the Kalkanians was more important than profit and shutted down the facilities. But the stock holders weren't satisfied with that decision and called for a new CEO; an evil man took control of the company and the mining operation restarted even when it implied drying Kalkanus Lambda 1. When the OSCA (Outer Space Civilization Agency) discovered that the company was illegally extracting water from a civilized planet, they send a group of diplomatists and scientists to settle the affair, but they disappeared mysteriously shortly after landing in the planet. Several attempts have been made to stop the illegal water extraction peacefully, but they all have failed, military action was taken but the planet is controlled by a mercenary army which implemented a shield system that prevents any military gear from being deployed on the surface of the planet without their consent. The only way to fight them is by stealing their weapons. We have managed to teleport people successfully but the mercenaries have patrols that kill anyone that dares to go in the open. Lucky for the Kalkanians you were able survive enough to steal a tank. You mission now is to clean up the planet from mercenaries and return the control of the planet to the Kalkanians.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Download <strong>free promotional artwork</strong> at:<br/></p>\n<p>https://my.desktopnexus.com/GQ5154/</p>\n<p>http://gq5154.deviantart.com/gallery/<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<p>March 17th 2017: Now you can choose your tank, also some bugs have been fixed.</p>\n<p>February 28th 2017: Finally, a complete demo is available, not yet fully tested, but playable. </p>\n<p>February 22nd 2017: Uploaded a demo for the Pvjmx convention (Monterrey Mexico) if you download this demo, bear in mind it is neither finished nor stable, there are still some bugs to fix and some features are yet to be implemented.</p>\n<p>January 31st 2017: Every day I'm getting closer to have a playable game, please stay tuned for the next few weeks, because I'll be publishing the latest version soon.</p>\n<p>December 2nd 2016: There's been months since I published last version, but all this time I've been working full time on this project.
