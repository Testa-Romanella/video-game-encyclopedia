However, it uses cutting edge 3D technology, which makes it look like RTS. Plus, the engine allows you to move a couple of units in a close sequence so that visually they move and shoot simultaneously producing RTS-style visual effects.<br/>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe game is based on the legendary Massive Assault series from which it inherits the best elements: original &amp;quot;Secret Allies&amp;quot; concept, streamlined turn-based gameplay, perfectly-balanced unit parameters, state-of-the art interface and endless replayability.<br/>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe gameplay is easy to understand, but difficult to conquer, and most importantly, very addictive. Lead your divisions, fleets and air squadrons to crush the enemies with no mercy!<br/> <ul><li>A.I. opponents for training <br/> </li><li>Fascinating 3D engine <br/> </li><li>Fancy Camera captures the most dramatic moments <br/> </li><li>Play multiple games simultaneously <br/> </li><li>Find live opponents of any desired skill level <br/> </li><li>25 beautiful planets, 42 units of all types<br/> </li></ul>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2009-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a066f69701ccb4bbe8c48330f088de0.jpg", "website": "http://www.massiveassaultnetwork.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 16, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 624, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wargaming.net"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Wargaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
