Made this game a little slower than most Ludum Dares, so there are a few bugs and messy features I didn't get to. Fairly happy with the idea, execution... not so much. Lot of room to expand though, so hopefully I can make it a full game some day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: W,A,S,D or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Shoot (Only available in Weapon Ship): Space</p>\n\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>Make you're way through space, stopping in at planets to slow down and avoid being overrun by meteors, and building up warp energy until you can escape through a worm hole.</p>\n<p>You need 300 energy before you can enter worm holes.</p>\n<p>You must be in a ship to enter or leave planets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ships:</strong></p>\n<p>Basic Ship - Nothing special, but good enough to enter and leave planets.</p>\n<p>Solar Ship - Can absorb suns to gain extra warp energy, but this damages the ship. Can also enter and leave planets.</p>\n<p>Weapon Ship - Can shoot a powerful blast vaporising all objects in its path, but using this weapon\u00a0damages the ship. Can also enter and leave planets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d747038715ad68bb79281ec20bd0ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LozzaDawg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
