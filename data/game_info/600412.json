You must find a way to escape or be trapped for eternity.   You arrive through a rusting elevator and reluctantly walk into the room. You cannot recall how you arrived, but you know you must find a way out. In one of the rooms, you find a music box. You do not know how but it changes the room around you. Use this newfound power and your wit to escape.</p>\n<p>Basement\r\n  </p>\n<p>The first stop on the elevator is a basement, pipes run across walls and along ceilings. Storage boxes and shelves have fallen over in the room ahead of you. You decide to explore, checking each of the rooms.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You find files scattered across the floor, filled with information about the other soldiers that were here. Medicine that was once ready to be used to treat your friends, now lies shattered on the floor.   </p>\n<p>When you turn to your left and see an old music box placed on a desk in the corner of the room. You realise that the music box is empty, but it reminds you of a nostalgic tune that used to play.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Main Ward\r\n  </p>\n<p>When the elevator arrives at the second floor, you immediately recognize the room around you. Dusty wheelchairs tipped over and medicine cabinets emptied. As you walk into the main ward you feel uneasy, memories come flooding back and you are sure you are not alone. The wind howls through the large open room, whistling between the metal bed frames.   </p>\n<p>A large scale sits in the centre of the room with three rocks weighing it down. You know this must be your way out and decide to explore more. You find a small office that must have belonged to a doctor.   </p>\n<p>Files and medicine clutter the shelves. Amongst the mess you find a rock exactly like the ones on the scale.\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Cafe \r\n  </p>\n<p>You press the third-floor button and when the doors open you are hit by the smell of rotting food. Bowls and plates lie on the floor. Bugs scutter around disappearing into the corners of the rooms.   You hear the sound of dripping water and a low buzz of electricity. A fuse box makes you jump as it sparks loud in the corner. Tables and chairs are scattered across the room and you can almost hear the whispers of other soldiers as they sit down to eat and discuss there days.</p>\n<p><strong>Development Team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Harvey Brownley: Team Lead, 3D Models</p>\n<p>Miles Collins: Programming Lead, Gameplay Scripting, Sound Implementation<br/></p>\n<p>Benedict Rigby: Gameplay Scripting, UI/UX Implementation, Unity Integration, Unwrapping, Texturing</p>\n<p>Joshua Gray: Puzzle Design</p>\n<p>Leanne Mcadam: Level Design</p>\n<p>Chris Geraghty: UI/UX Design, Texturing, Audio Mixing, Quality Assurance<br/></p>\n<p>Michael How: Gameplay Design</p>\n<p>Aysha Berghout: 2D Art, Texturing</p>\n<p>Vasileios Kapodistias: SFX, Music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:53:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/540cb8e472d6368b951bdf874d241fab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Macaca Media"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
