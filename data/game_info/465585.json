While a crate is in the Control-Tek 9000 it can not be affected by gravity, but the moment it leaves, is the moment the box will fall. Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 in 48 hours.\u00a0 I am aware of the many glitches and lack of levels.\u00a0IMPORTANT - If you are playing with a standard 16:9 monitor, please click on the blue fullscreen button.
