You can follow me here on itch or on twitter for more stuff :)</p>\r\n\r\nPlonat Atek is a polar breakout-like game that is played by viewing the Audio output on a Vectorscope/Oscilloscope.\r\n\r\n<p>It also features an audiovisual (8-beat-short) soundtrack and sound effects! Since what you see on the 'scope is the sound, the sound effects double as visual feedback/impact effects and the soundtrack has been hidden in the graphics.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe project was built in PureData, a visual programming language for audio, or a digital modular synthesizer if you will. It requires a few modules from \r\n\tzexy, an extension to vanilla PureData (I have created this game in pd-extended, which includes  zexy and other extensions).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere is also a .wav file for those who cannot or don't want to run PureData but want to check if that sound-is-image thing is really true :P\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou will also either need a real Oscilloscope (in which case I would loooove a video of yours!) or an emulator, like these two:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://dood.al/oscilloscope/ (web)</li>\n<li>https://asdfg.me/osci/ (win/mac/linux)</li>\n<li>https://github.com/Foohy/Oscillofun#user-content-download (win, simplest setup but worst graphcis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can find some proof of it running on my scope \r\n\tin my ldjam feed and on twitter.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Setup takes a few steps. It is worth it in my experience though - not because of my game, but because of all the other stuff you can look at as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jerobeam Fenderson's Original Video and Oscilloscope Music</li>\n<li>Oscillofun video/song</li>\n<li>Youscope</li>\n<li>lot's of normal songs you like</li>\n</ul>\r\nQuick &amp; Dirty Version\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Windows, you can download the \r\n\t<strong>Windows Bundle</strong>, which contains the source patch, PureData itself, and the simplest Oscilloscope Emulator I could find.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>This Oscilloscope emulator is the most basic though, and looks the worst - it really doesn't showcase the game well</strong>, so if you are willing to spend a bit more time or effort than just unpack + doubleclick, and maybe learn a bit about the audio signals you hear every day, <strong>I strongly encourage you to read the download and setup instructions for a full setup guide</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJust open <strong>run.bat</strong> and when everything has opened and you hear loud, random sounds, <strong>focus a PureData window</strong> and use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to play.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fbe767a6f6c6a1ea026a1c44b1cf9f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["s-ol"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
