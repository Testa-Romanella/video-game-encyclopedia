Your goal is to settle and create a large-scale farm to grow and supply Earth\u2019s ever-growing population of humans with food and other supplies made much rarer due to the lack of farm space Earth has. Initial arrival has run smoothly and your home and basic farming resources arrived on the new planet, with your animals to be arriving in around a week or so once setup has passed regulatory inspection. Among your initial supplies is a weather adjustment device (WAD), which is primarily used to terraform portions of the planet on a small scale in case predictions on climate are slightly amiss. You wake to find the WAD malfunctioning, causing a huge snowstorm threatening to bury you in an endless blizzard.\u00a0Your goal is to search around your newly created farmstead to find replacement parts to fix the WAD and bring your area back to a nice warm climate.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Winter Reflections: Kevin MacLeod<br/>Door Closing: Nichols8917<br/>Metal hit: jorickhoofd<br/>Bag: detamine<br/>Locked Door: Leady<br/>Keys on Table: Areti18<br/>Paper flip: gynation<br/>Gate Latch: mhtaylor67<br/>Lightswitch: tbrook</p>\n<p>Skybox: Night Sound Games<br/>Wood Textures: Mezanix<br/>Snow Texture: Mesh Zone 3D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f08/f086ee1ad56c2f86edd27e056a7c2417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaredBronstein"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
