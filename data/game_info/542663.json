You moved to a new city a year ago. One morning, you went outside and found poop at your door again. It looks like someone of your new neighbors left it there. But you don\u2019t know who exactly did it, so you will have to give your present to each of them. Be careful, for it\u2019s not something they might like when they find poop at their doors.<br/>\r\nYour task is to come up to your neighbors\u2019 houses and leave your poop at their doors. Just as you do so, the owner of the house will run after you. The more neighbors are running after you, the harder it will be to escape from them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T02:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/acefd1e37805c76878b8b215b3d1fb2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Biscuit Play"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Biscuit Play"], "esrb_rating": null}
