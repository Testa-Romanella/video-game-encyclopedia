The move controls on this game are not your conventional control options. the \"right arrow key\" makes the game move forward, the \"left arrow key\" makes the marble move backwards, the \"up key\" makes the marble move left and the \"down key\" makes the marble move right. This was done to set the game different from other marble games.The aim of this game is to get to the gold structure at the end of each level. This transports you to the next level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T08:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/443b5aaa62b3baa1fc63cc85b1a21c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["dorothyakpovwa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
