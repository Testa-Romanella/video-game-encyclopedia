These quickfire challenges force you to quickly survey your surroundings and then jump into action in order to progress through the 100+ floors and net as much cash as possible along the way. You can climb Spearmint Tower solo, or bring along a friend to share in the frustration!</p>\n<p>The game starts with the\u00a0core floor-climbing, obstacle-negotiation of Donkey Kong and piles on the original Mario Bros.' single-screen management, and then cranks up the speed for slippier, sloppier silliness. With over 100 levels, unlockable characters, multiplayer action, and toe-tapping tunes, <strong>Collateral Thinking DX</strong> is more than ready to satisfy your arcade addiction!</p>\n<p>--&gt; 100+ Levels!<br/>--&gt; Co-Op Multiplayer! <br/>--&gt; Unlockable Characters!<br/>--&gt; Classic Callbacks!<br/>--&gt; Satisfyingling Simple + Simply Satisfying!<br/>--&gt; The Free Market is never wrong!(?)</p>\n<p>* <strong>Collateral Thinking</strong> is also available on the\u00a0<strong>Wii U eshop</strong>!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fd76ddf2dd663325234ad356c7df06c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astrosaurus Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
