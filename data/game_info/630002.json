Chaos.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>You are just serving the whisky one customer at a time, doing your job, and from nothing, someone flips a table in some corner of the saloon. Everyone freezes. That one second of silence... that omen of what is about to happen... the guns are out. Now the sound of the piano is getting stuffy with all the noise of gibber, shoots, glass, and screams. The place was turned into complete chaos. You can see the cheap wood floor start to burn, although not much because the floor is wet with blood. Glasses of whiskey and bullets are flying between the room. Probably you are going to die.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>________________________________________________________</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\nActionsKeyboardControllerMOVEWASDLeft Joystick<br/>DODGE<br/>ShiftFace Left<br/>INTERACTSpaceFace Bottom<br/>\n\r\nAvailable\u00a0Translations\r\n<p>English\u00a0 and Portugu\u00eas Brasil<br/></p>\n<p>________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>PS 1:\u00a0</strong></em> Chaos in the Saloon is the result of not more than three weeks of work and an idea picked from two random papers in a mug. :)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>PS 2:</em></strong> The Mac OS is untested, I don't know if is working correctly.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>A game created by Henrique Darko</em></strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d81/d814f36e850506dbc788d4ad3603d5e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["henridarko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
