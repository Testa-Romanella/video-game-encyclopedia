Instead you\u2019ll have to rely upon your trusty turrets to defend you. Your turrets require a large investment of materials which can only be obtained by killing enemies. Minimalistic visuals allow you to focus purely upon the gameplay, while the neon-rock soundtrack heightens every moment.</p>\n<p>Contributors<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mark Robertson - Programmer</li><li>Alec Vanlint - Designer</li><li>Brendan Head - Sound Production</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03b6b903be4212010b4f741aae05a0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minimal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
