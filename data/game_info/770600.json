It's best played with a controller, I\u00a0hope that doesn't deter too many people. I\u00a0had so many ideas that I\u00a0wasn't able to get into this game before the jams time limit. Even as I\u00a0submit this I\u00a0see things I\u00a0wish I\u00a0had a little more time to change, but over all, I'm really just happy I was able to finish something and share it with people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me during the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T13:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/1366b457c980bdfe7ed8ee03bd7607e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wishing Rock"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
