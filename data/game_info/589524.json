You are now significantly more grumpy, and take out your anger on the nearby robots and sacred temple.<br/><br/>Enemies drop power ups. You pick them up. They go away after 10 seconds. Picking up the next one resets the timer.<br/><br/>This game is a balancing act of speed, collection, and accuracy, if you lose your powerups, life becomes significantly more difficult. If impressions are positive, then more can be added, this project was a blast to work on, and we would both love to continue to add features!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pre-jam Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Footstep sounds.</li><li>Shooting sounds.</li><li>Bullet impact sounds.</li><li>Pickup sounds.</li><li>Checkpoint sounds.</li><li>UI sounds.</li><li>Global wind sound.</li><li>1 Music track for second boss.</li><li>Blunderbuss Model.</li><li>Skeleton Model.</li><li>3 House Models</li><li>4 Animations for CRU5H-3R</li><li>3 Animations for Cyborgs</li><li>Player Walk Left/Right/Back/Forward (Blended with custom upper-body animation)</li><li>Mesa Rocks (Heavily modified during jam) from Quixel.</li><li>Fonts: Vanilla Whale and Share Tech Mono</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90c979d26be6362ea51b7a800d8448f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Scott", "Gambsmoore"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
