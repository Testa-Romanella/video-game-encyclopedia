The game in itself was made for my 'Game Projects' class, alongside my two friends Silvia and Lucas. The rules are as following:</p>\n<ul><li>Every two turns, you switch boards with your opponent;</li><li>The loser is whoever has the board when all its ships are destroyed;</li><li>Players have two actions, which they can divide between <em>MOVEMENT</em> (move a ship) and <em>BANZAI</em> (fire at a tile in your opponent's board);</li><li>Not only do you have to place your ships, but you also have to place your <em>TREASURE</em> (basically, a power-up). If your opponent hits your <em>TREASURE</em>, you need to hide it again next turn;</li><li>A\u00a0<em>TREASURE</em> can be:<ul><li><em>BONUS ACTIONS</em>: when you use it, you have 4 actions instead of 2;</li><li><em>BARRIER</em>: when you apply a barrier on a ship, each of its tiles can survive two shots instead of only one;</li><li><em>RADAR</em>: when you use it, you must select a line on your opponent's board - all its tiles are revealed to you.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>It may look kinda complicated but actually I find it's a lot more fun than vanilla Battleships (which is just hurr durr select random number rinse repeat). The objective of this project was exactly that: to take a simple base game and try to make it more fun.</p>\n<p>This only works with Local Networks, which means that you must use Hamachi or something like it. I'm learning!</p><p>This game's code is on my GitHub. It was made in September 2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a27228bd57108d161a6945a9f62365c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vinizinho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
