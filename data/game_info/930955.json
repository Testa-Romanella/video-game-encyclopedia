As a reward, exquisite CG needs to test your shooting ability to obtain. Use the mouse to control the horizontal movement of your gun, and destroy all targets to pass the level. The props will be dropped randomly when attacking various marine creatures, which can enhance the attack power or increase the amount of life. At the same time, being touched by marine creatures will also lose the life value, so it is not necessary to drain the last drop of blood here.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T05:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a520eded1db1a2f66465ff29f72284d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ST BEA GAMES"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ST BEA GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
