Fortunately, a chiropractor is only a boat ride away. Unfortunately, a fat and sleepy bear wandered onto your boat before you left, and now you and the bear have shipwrecked onto a small island, with only a blueberry bush and a small pool of freshwater.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Survive by drinking and eating, but most importantly by avoiding the bear. Can you do this while only seeing the color of the ground beneath your feet?</strong></p>\n<p>Use the slider to limit the screen however you want.
