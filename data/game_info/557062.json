And please don't come away from the game thinking that I hate Pac-Man; I still have a great fondness for the <em>pucky </em>little game.</p>\n<p>As with my other Bitsy games, Pareidolia was another attempt to push the engine as far as I could. This time I delved into modifying the javascript engine code itself. Which is, I suppose, the Bitsy equivalent of <em>wall-hacking</em> but it proved to be a nice way to work.</p>\n<p>(I thought I might be first to emulate Pac-Man in Bitsy, but no; <strong>Em</strong> made this incredible hand-linked 800+ room Bitsy game.)<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you liked this, please check out my other Bitsy games; Cinerarium (of Solaris) and\u00a0The Solivagants.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>Game</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Rowan Crawford</li></ul>\n<p><em>Engine</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Bitsy by Adam Le Doux</li><li>Bitsy-Savior by Elkie Nova</li><li>Bitsy hacks by Sean S.
