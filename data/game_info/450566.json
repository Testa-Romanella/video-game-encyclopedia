She must travel to a huge volcanic mountain inside which<br/>lives the secret of Drofanayrb's horrible experiments.\u00a0 Will she reach the<br/>Heart of the World?\u00a0 Will she be able to face what she finds there and do<br/>what she must to banish the evil unleashed by the Wizard's unspeakable<br/>tampering with nature?\u00a0 Nine totally new levels with even more new<br/>weapons, monsters, treasures, stunning graphics, music and sound effects!</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls<br/>-----------------</p>\n<p>Following is a list of the primary keyboard controls used in the game:</p>\n<p>* LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys make Nikita run.</p>\n<p>* SHIFT makes Nikita jump.</p>\n<p>* ALT makes Nikita transform from wolf to human form, or back again.\u00a0 Note<br/>\u00a0 that this transformation will consume mana (represented by the tree in<br/>\u00a0 the lower left corner of the status bar); you can't transform unless you<br/>\u00a0 have enough mana.</p>\n<p>* SPACE makes Nikita attack.\u00a0 While in human form, she can only attack<br/>\u00a0 after finding a suitable weapon; while in wolf form, she can always<br/>\u00a0 attack with her teeth.</p>\n<p>* DOWN arrow key crouches if Nikita is on the floor, or climbs down if she<br/>\u00a0 is on a ladder, pole, vine, etc.\u00a0 Also, you can use the DOWN arrow to<br/>\u00a0 pick up weapons and treasures, or type T (for \"take\").</p>\n<p>* UP arrow key gets up from a crouching position, climbs up, enters<br/>\u00a0 doorways, or makes Nikita flip upwards while hanging from a handhold.<br/>\u00a0 Also, if you hold the UP arrow when jumping, Nikita will flip into the<br/>\u00a0 air, gaining a little additional height.\u00a0 Finally, if you hold the UP<br/>\u00a0 arrow while attacking in wolf form, Nikita will go into a frenzy and<br/>\u00a0 MAUL anything nearby.\u00a0 You can still use the left and right arrows to<br/>\u00a0 move while mauling.\u00a0 As with transforming, mauling is a special magical<br/>\u00a0 maneuver and requires mana; it continues to consume mana for as long as<br/>\u00a0 you hold down the attack button to keep mauling.</p>\n<p>* CTRL key activates levers, switches, and SAVE GAME signposts.</p>\n<p>* TAB or \"T\" key picks up any object Nikita is currently positioned over.</p>\n<p>* \"U\" or \"G\" key picks up and immediately use any object Nikita is over.</p>\n<p>* \"A\" or \"I\" key accesses the inventory menu, allowing you to use, drop,<br/>\u00a0 or throw items in Nikita's inventory.</p>\n<p>* F1 through F8 activate the object in the corresponding slot of Nikita's<br/>\u00a0 Inventory or Pack.</p>\n<p>* 1 through 5 activate the magic spells Nikita can learn during the game,<br/>\u00a0 which appear as small icons between the two snakes on the status bar.</p>\n<p>* ESC and \"P\" (Pause) keys pause the game and enter the main menu.</p>\n<p>* F10 displays the help file which also contains all of this information.</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Mana<br/>-------------</p>\n<p>In the status bar across the bottom of the display, you will see a large<br/>golden jar containing a bubbling blue fluid.\u00a0 This fluid is the Seltzer of<br/>Life and represents Nikita's health.\u00a0 When nikita is injured or hurt, the<br/>fluid level goes down.\u00a0 If the jar becomes completely empty, Nikita dies<br/>and you have to start over at the beginning of the level, or at the last<br/>place you saved your game.</p>\n<p>You will also see a tree in the status bar. This is the mana tree and<br/>represents Nikita's mana level.\u00a0 Mana is used to transform from wolf to<br/>human form and to invoke magic attack spells.\u00a0 The number of leaves on the<br/>mana tree represents how much mana she has. As Nikita uses her mana, the<br/>leaves fall from the tree and must be replenished by picking up gems or<br/>potions or finding sanctuaries.</p>\n<p>Spells<br/>------</p>\n<p>As Nikita progresses through the game and defeats enemies, she will learn<br/>additional magical spells, which you can activate by pressing the 1<br/>through 5 keys on the keyboard.\u00a0 As with transformation and mauling,<br/>casting these spells requires mana; more powerful spells require more<br/>mana.\u00a0 The first two spells, Stinger and Fireball, are available in the<br/>SHAREWARE version of the game; however, the three most powerful spells,<br/>Doball, Ghibli, and Lightning Bolt, are only available in the REGISTERED<br/>game.</p>\n<p>There are also various magical scrolls, potions, and wands scattered<br/>throughout the levels of the game, which Nikita can pick up and use.\u00a0 Some<br/>of these items correspond to the spells described above; in this case,<br/>Nikita does not have to have learned the spell yet in order to use a<br/>scroll or wand to cast it, and using a scroll or wand does not consume<br/>mana since the mana comes \"pre-packaged\" in the magical item.\u00a0 There are<br/>also various other powerful magical items that do not correspond to any of<br/>the standard spells; you will learn about them as you encounter them.</p>\n<p>Amulets<br/>-------</p>\n<p>There are three types of magical amulets which Nikita can collect during<br/>her adventures. These amulets are very valuable and should always be<br/>collected whenever possible.\u00a0 There is exactly one amulet on every level.<br/>If you miss the amulet on a level, then that level will be marked in red<br/>rather than in blue on the episode map, indicating that you may want to go<br/>back and replay that level later to find the amulet.</p>\n<p>Health amulets are blue. If Nikita has more health amulets, her blue<br/>health level will go down more slowly when she is hurt or injured.</p>\n<p>Mana amulets are green. If Nikita has more mana amulets, her mana level<br/>will not go down as quickly as she uses mana.</p>\n<p>Strength amulets are red.\u00a0 Nikita's strength is increased when she<br/>collects more of them, making her attacks more powerful against enemies.</p>\n<p>Inventory<br/>---------</p>\n<p>When Nikita picks up objects in the game, they are collected into her<br/>Inventory or Pack. There are eight slots in Nikita's pack. Each slot may<br/>be able to hold more than one of a given type of object.</p>\n<p>Selecting \"Inventory\" from the main menu will display a new menu of the<br/>objects in Nikita's pack if there are any. You can also access the<br/>inventory menu directly with the \"A\" or \"I\" key.</p>\n<p>If you select an item from the inventory, a new menu will appear asking<br/>you what you would like to do with that object.\u00a0 You can either \"use\" the<br/>object or remove it from the inventory by \"dropping\" or \"tossing\" it.</p>\n<p>Since more than one of the same type of object can be stored in each<br/>inventory slot, you are also given the option of taking the action on just<br/>one of the objects or on all of the objects within the slot.</p>\n<p>Function keys F1 thru F8 are shortcuts to using the items in Nikita's<br/>pack.\u00a0 For example, pressing F1 will use one item from the first slot in<br/>the inventory.\u00a0 To make it easier to know at a glance which slot<br/>corresponds to which function key, there is a small empty space on the<br/>status bar between the F4 and F5 slots, corresponding to the space between<br/>the F4 and F5 keys on most keyboards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba6856ba75078c032ee37594ab48638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sleepless"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
