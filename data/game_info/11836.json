Upon his arrival some surprise is waiting for him there . The base is evacuated and protection system doesn`t let out anybody. Furthermore, it works for destruction of all life forms. The envoy will be trapped and there is no way out for him.<br/><br/>It`s quite difficult to complete this level, because you need hack the terminal which is charge of protecting lazer fields. The first person who can hack the terminal, will get money reward.
