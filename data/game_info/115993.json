Do you like to push heavy blocks for no good reason? In that case, ChronoBox is for you. Our little hero, Baxter, is lost in time and space, and the only way he can get home is to solve the puzzles in each room. Some are easy, some will make you cry.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJust move the orange blocks over the switches to unlock doors. Use the WASD or arrow keys to move Baxter, press E to move blocks and the SPACE BAR to jump. And if you have trouble finding all the switches, change the camera angle to get a better view.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can try some levels for free (you are gonna love them) And if you really like ChronoBox, you can buy the complete version to get more levels and regular updates.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New render:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Old render:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nUpdates 13/09/2016\r\n<p>\r\n\t- Fixed a bug in level 6\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t- Optimized models for better performance\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t- New illumination system\r\n</p>\r\nTrashbot Studios\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe are a indie development studio from Ecuador, South America.
