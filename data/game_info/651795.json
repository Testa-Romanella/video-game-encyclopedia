Since the theme was \"Keep it simple!\", I took a literal approach to this theme, and the main objective, apart from not dying from the asteroids, is to protect the SIMPLE word in the middle of the screen.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong></li></ul>\n<p>You can either use WASD or the arrow keys to move forwards and backwards (WS/up-down), or to rotate left or right (AD/left-right). Use the SPACE or left mouse button to shoot!</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Where to play?<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>You can play this on Web, or in Windows/Linux/Mac. Be warned: I've only tested this game on Windows, and I don't have enough time to test it on the other platforms. Sorry about that :-(</p>\n<p>Also, for some reason, the game lags A LOT on Firefox, so you should play it on Chrome. Sorry about that too :-((</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Credits<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Joiro Hatagaya for the \"8-BIT WONDER\" font (score, life counter, and GAME OVER message).</p>\n<p>Eric Fredricksen, Chris McCormick and DrPetter for the JSFXR and SFXR tools for making 8-bit sounds</p>\n<p>Terry Cavanagh for organizing this amazing jam</p>\n<p>The Universe, for having begun with the initial conditions that led to this exact moment</p>\n<p>And, of course, THANKS TO YOU for playing! You're amazing :-D</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Bugfixes/new features?<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Possibly not :-(. I'm rather busy, and I'd have loved to put some more stuff in the game (asteroid fragments, start-game screen, in-game credits).</p>\n<p>Also, the continuous sound heard when hit is a bug, but it was cool (and weird to debug...), so I kept it as a feature.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Any comments/suggestions?<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Just leave them in the comment section :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf0e9d5d07a83feeb5b395620b1116c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Yxuer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
