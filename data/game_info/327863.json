Players must navigate through back-to-back shifts during the busiest week of the year, as the Paramedic begins to experience workplace burnout for the first time. The game teaches players about self-care and work/life balance, with the overall aim of making players more aware of their own physical and mental health and wellbeing.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The target audience of Blood/Sweat/Tears is anyone over the age of 18 who either currently has, or who may at some point in the future have multiple responsibilities such as a job, study commitments, or carer obligations. The content may also be appropriate for younger audiences over the age of 14 who may be considering entering the workforce for the first time, however these players should be warned about the nature of the content before commencing play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T05:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94d0722d0c1ac3fdc186c7bbfbd8f9ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dizmackay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
