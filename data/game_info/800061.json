It is adapted from the psychologist-oriented early AI Eliza, but with more machine-learning capabilities. It is currently being displayed and demoed at public libraries and schools as researchers assess the AI\u2019s intelligence.<br/></p>\n<p>You will play as human users and the AI itself. How you choose to interact as each will influence the game\u2019s ending.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>This game is currently a work in progress.
