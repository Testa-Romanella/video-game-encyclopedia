{"id": 538028, "slug": "immortal-until", "name": "Immortal Until", "name_original": "Immortal Until", "description": "<p>Immortal Until is an RPG Platforming game centered around randomly generated levels. The game was built from the ground up to be compatible with coop and coopetitive play. It plays somewhat similarly to Zelda 2 and Mario 3 as a result. In Immortal Until, you work with Kaze and Fibi to uncover the secrets to their curse and also save the Kingdom of Junios from utter destruction! You can consult the manual or website\u00a0for more information.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Immortal Until features many levels with lots of enemies, platforms, and weapons to use! You can also create and share your own custom levels using the level editor!</p>\n<p>This game makes use of mechanics such as Class Weapons which offer new moves and/or stat boosts to allow you to build your character your way. Stopping by towns will also allow you to buy, sell, or train at shops and gyms so you're extra prepared for the next level!</p>\n<p>The world of Ordon is ever-changing! Unique levels are generated for each playthrough, which gives a variety of levels and obstacles to overcome each time to play. If you're not a fan of generated content, there are still handcrafted levels sprinkled throughout the game's overworld.</p>\n<p>While the only accessible area is the Forests of Ordon, there is plans to also include three more worlds: The Arteenan Desert, the Hrumar Mountains, and a dimension beyond that lies between worlds!</p>\n\n<p>You can try out Immortal Until for free right now! The demo features most of the game's content leading up to the second world. There are a few different weapons and a lot of different enemy types to encounter as you explore the Kingdom of Junios. The level editor is also available for free in the demo!</p>\n\n<p>As a one-man project, it is difficult to set an exact date for release. However, I'm sure I can get the game finished in 2021 as long as things keep moving smoothly. Many of the game's base features are already in place and the production of new worlds is relatively fast and easy to do now that the systems are in place.</p>\n<p>One of my biggest concerns at the moment is making sure the game is easy to pick up and play, the features are easy to understand and accessible, and ensuring the game stays fun and balanced all the way until release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/317c8adaad9585ecb96f25b09bb2b122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darius Alvanez"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
