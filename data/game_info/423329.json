It started out as just a learning project, but as I went on I decided I wanted to share it with other people. As of now it's in a prototype phase and a few things seem really out of place. The main focus of the game is to stay alive as long as you can while killing as many cheese monsters as you can, so please try it out and let me know what you think. I'd love to know what bugs you can find!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1604afd74527f7cd538e5ccbe12b99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goldie Gamez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
