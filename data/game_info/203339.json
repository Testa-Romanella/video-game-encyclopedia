A group of thieves is out to steal your watch, but they'll only make their move when you're not looking. Tilt your Apple Watch away from you and the thieves will scatter. Tilt it back toward you to see where they've moved. Your job is to pick out the thief leader in the pack before he steals your watch. The thief leader will only ever move forward, while his henchmen will sneak backwards now and then. The thieves will elect a new leader every round, so stay on your toes. Stop him before he swipes your watch!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b96909029dc96aee3ddc1769a312e596.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinLennox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
