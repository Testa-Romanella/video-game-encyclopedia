The vertical line shows which stream the next <strong>data packet</strong> received will be sent down. When a <strong>data packet</strong> reaches an <strong>access point</strong> of an opponent it will reduce it's <strong>firewall</strong>. The strength of an <strong>access point's firewall</strong> is shown by the rings around it. If an opponents <strong>access point</strong> has no <strong>firewall</strong> left you will take control of the <strong>access point</strong>.</p>\n<p>Only <strong>mainframes</strong> can create new <strong>data packets</strong>. They release them automatically every second. <strong>Mainframes</strong> are shown larger than <strong>access points</strong>. Taking over an opponents <strong>mainframe</strong> gives you an additional <strong>mainframe</strong>. You will need a <strong>mainframe</strong> to continue so protect yours well.</p>\n<p>Happy hacking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f857511eaef576612801325b968dd3bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["David Williamson"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
