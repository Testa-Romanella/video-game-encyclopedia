The gameplay is fast-paced and decisions are easy to understand but meaningful.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Your deck consists of14 cards: one of those cards is a King and the rest form their army. Your aim is to kill the opponent's King.</p>\n<p>You start the game with your King and three other random cards from your army in hand. Each turn, you and your opponent secretly select a card to <em>clash</em>. Those cards then deal damage to each other, reducing their health. Whenever one of your cards dies, you draw a new random card from your army. Powerful cards have a cooldown period that lasts a number of clashes, during which you can't clash with them.</p>\r\nStrategizing\r\n<p>Many cards have abilities that make clashing more exciting. Some of those abilities include healing,\u00a0 damaging, reducing the cooldown and temporarily buffing cards in hands. Timing those effects well can be important to winning the game.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can strategize based on information of your opponent's hand, what they are likely to play and by taking advantage of the cooldown period of the more powerful cards.<br/></p>\n<p>Remember that Kings can also clash. In fact, if the rest of  your army is dead or in cooldown then they have to. However, you shouldn't necessarily think to leave your King for the end, because they often have powerful effects that allow them to handle less powerful cards with ease. This way, you can keep your more powerful threats to deal with the opponent's King. On the other hand, clashing with your King exposes them to danger, especially if the opponent can predict your play.<br/></p>\r\nOffline and PvP Play\r\n<p>The game features a fairly competent AI, which tries to read your deck and hand, predict and adapt to your plays and bluff its way in certain situations.<br/></p>\n<p>However, it also comes with a server, which allows you to setup network and online play, as well as trading with other players. In the future, we will try to setup our own server.</p>\r\nTrading Card Game\r\n<p>Currently, KingClashers features 155 cards, which you can use to construct your own decks. You can find those cards by opening boosters (in-game currency to get boosters can only be obtained by playing games).<br/></p>\n<p>You can use online and network play to trade those cards with other players.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/475/475fc808bb83b881eee2acbc2a2d1073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["maniospas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
