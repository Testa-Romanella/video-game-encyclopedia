It isn't a daily challenge, so you can reopen it as many times in one day as you like. Here's how to play:</p>\n<p>- The game chooses a secret 23-letter word from its list. The aim is to try and guess the word in as few attempts as possible.</p>\n<p>- Guess a word by typing it into the text box at the bottom of the screen, and pressing the green 'enter' button.</p>\n<p>- Each letter will get a colour. If a letter is green, it means that letter appears in the same spot in the secret word. If it is yellow, it appears in a different spot/multiple different spots. If it stays grey, then the letter doesn't appear at all.</p>\n<p>- If you don't get it within 6 guesses, you lose and the word is shown on the screen.</p>\n<p>A list of all the 23-letter words the game uses can be found in the .zip folder, beside the executable.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This game is basically a joke. Don't take it too seriously.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:14:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e9/9e9737ff83e9e0fbe5b7457f10dc03e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ilikecheez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
