Fight your way through a dungeon where, if you go through a portal, your entire play style has to change!</p>\n<p>There are three weapons:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Force Field: a yellow attack that has to charge up. Hits hard but has a long cooldown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Hammer: a massive hammer that slams down on enemies, but like the Force Field, must charge up and has a long cooldown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Sword: a light sword; less damage, but also less of a cooldown and no charge.</p>\n<p>Navigate with WASD and attack with the mouse button; hold down mouse button to charge attacks, when applicable. Press escape to pause the game.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/830504d60466bd6e22a2bc23019c30c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["huckleberryjen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
