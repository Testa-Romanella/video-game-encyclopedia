Ready for Take off, though, makes it especially easy to relive the last holiday trip from the cockpit\u2019s view, even for less experienced PC pilots. Unlike more complex flight simulations, Ready for Take off  was designed from the ground up to enable beginners to successfully complete a flight with less effort and learning. Advanced flight simulation enthusiasts in turn have a straightforward all-in-one solution at hand, including lots of airports right from the start.<br/><br/>The player can take place behind the control stick of one of the most well known airliners: the Airbus A320. Its cockpit places all the important functions and systems at the player\u2019s disposal \u2013 voice recordings from real air traffic help create the appropriate atmosphere. Additionally, the simulation includes a Beechcraft Baron for short range and training flights.<br/><br/>Ready for Take off comes with 9 travel destinations out of the box, including the airports of D\u00fcsseldorf, Palma de Mallorca, London Heathrow, and Nice. Their 3D models are of high quality and rich in details. They also feature movable objects \u2013 luggage carts, busses, pushback trucks, jetways, etc. create a lively apron scenery. A day and night cycle makes these sceneries appear in the right mood.<br/><br/>In the beginning, players can choose whether they want to fly freely between two airports or experience long-term thrill in the career mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Airlines:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Airbus A 320<br/></li><li>Beechcraft Baron</li></ul><br/><strong>Flight area:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Europe airports:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Hamburg<br/></li><li>Dusseldorf<br/></li><li>Zurich<br/></li><li>Paris Orly<br/></li><li>London Heathrow<br/></li><li>Nice<br/></li><li>Palma<br/></li><li>Kos<br/></li><li>Antalya</li></ul><br/><strong>Game modes:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Tutorial<br/></li><li>Random flight<br/></li><li>Route selection<br/></li><li>Free flight<br/></li><li>Career</li></ul><br/><strong>Other:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Beginner friendly<br/></li><li>Achievements<br/></li><li>Day and night mode<br/></li><li>Animated Pilot models in the cockpit<br/></li><li>3 camera views <br/></li><li>Original voice recordings with real pilots<br/></li><li>Liveries of various European airlines</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5db/5db26ef685800c6acf40909a31d3ec91.jpg", "website": "http://www.aerosoft.com/en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ExViRe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["SimWare Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
