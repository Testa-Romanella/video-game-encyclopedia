We're really proud of our musics and our layer system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We truly hope you'll like it, and make it to the end as there is an happy ending!(and sorry the game is harder than we thought)!</p>\n<p>The game can be finished in around 10 minutes but is pretty hard...</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE : After a good night of sleep and a couple of hours of debugging, we are releasing a corrected version of the build! As specified in the rulebook, we only corrected some near-gamebreaking bugs or things that were there but not showing for some reason... No extra content/mechanics were added.</p>\n<p>What's been corrected:</p>\n<p>- Realignment of some platforms/enemies</p>\n<p>- Dialogs with PNJ now correctly displayed</p>\n<p>- End cutscene is now correctly triggered</p>\n<p>End notes:</p>\n<p>All assets, codes, visuals, musics and sounds were created by us during the Jam, with the exception of two text fonts:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- MadJoe by 160 Studio - https://www.creativefabrica.com/designer/160-studio/ref/236320/</p>\n<p>- OpenDyslexic - https://opendyslexic.org/</p>\n<p>Our team: We are Andzura, Heo, Saltysa and Scratch! We pretty much shared most of the work without clear distinctions, except:</p>\n<p>- Saltysa did all the visuals</p>\n<p>- Andzura did the cool-as-hell disturbing remix of Scratch's song</p>\n<p>- Heo taught us everything about Git and its complexity (and we didn't listened... Sorry Heo!)</p>\n<p>- Scratch cooked (mostly, and with the help of the others, but it was his recipes)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e8dfabeeee2fc7a92e14b8be4f5660e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andzura"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
