As you know, all of our best government politicians have decided that every citizen should be judged at every waking moment of their lives! To assist in this process you, the honorable judge, shall be reviewing each and every person to see if they have broken any of the laws that have been provided to you! Simply <em>charge</em> the ones who break those laws! Isn\u2019t that fun?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no time to waste though, as the laws get added and changed every day! We\u2019ve also taken the liberty to automate half of the process for you by adding a conveyer belt to your workspace so you can judge them all as quickly as you can. After all, efficiency is key!<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck out there, new judge!</p>\n<p>- Department of Nonsensical Laws and Rulings</p>\n<p><strong>How to play: People will come down the conveyor and their activities will be listed on the suspect profile. Things that are illegal will be listed on the criminal offenses document. It's your job to determine whether the suspect's activities break the given laws. If they do, hit space to charge them with a crime!</strong></p><p>Note: Be sure to put the game in full screen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:50:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheTurtleDuckMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
