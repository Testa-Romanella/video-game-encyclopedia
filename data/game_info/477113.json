The Soothsayer's Augury games were popular early text adventures from AMICO Inc., not unlike Colossal Cave Adventure or Infocom's Zork games.<br/></p>\n<p>SA3: TDP was supposed to release Christmas 1983, but after two rapid changes in creative direction, massive resource shifts, a period of intense crunch, a series of disastrous playtests, and the acquisition of AMICO Inc. by Infocom, the project was shuttered and everyone on staff was laid off. <br/></p>\n<p>Towards the end of production, the lead designer, John Leonard Lyles, had something of a nervous breakdown dealing with the tight deadlines, conflicting notes, and a rapidly shifting interactive market. Shortly after being laid off, JLL moved to Thailand and ordained as an ascetic in a Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na monastery. He lives there to this day.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note that these files, in this unfinished state, may only be of interest to ardent interactive fiction historians, text adventure hobbyists, and those interested in JLL's philosophies.</p>\n\n<p>These source files contain all the extant material from the game, along with JLL's code comments, which I think you'll see are a tad... eccentric. Most of the actual adventure is missing. All that remains is a  short intro... and three conversations with deleted NPCs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d970786b4c2f731d72f55d4c37c883d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CogsAndSpanners"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
