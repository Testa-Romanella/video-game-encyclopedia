The idea for this game came from the night before my last Teacher Certification exam. I was fighting monsters under the Golden Tree when my friend texted, \"How's the Teacher Certification Test? \". I just went crazy...... Then immediately begin to print the admission ticket, take out the book, open the teaching app to start learning quickly. Then I thought, if the learning process had been a little more fun, or if I had been given achievements while studying, or at least if the learning process had happened on <strong>Steam</strong>, maybe I wouldn't have left it until the last minute? So I wrote down the idea. The next day, after the exam, I named the project \"Teacher Certification Hell\" and started making the game.
