The idea of a galaxy under attack from alien invaders and you, a lone space pilot with an advanced space ship is like a plot out of a sci-fi movie.\u00a0<br/><br/>Protecting the galaxy from swarms of aliens was a staple of arcade space shooters, and I hope I have recreated that experience for you on both the iPhone and Apple Watch! Have fun piloting your space ship, blowing up swarms of alien enemies - and don't forget to avoid those asteroids!<br/><br/>Thanks for playing<br/>-Johnno", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T05:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f7a567c87683036049be9bdf16ac001.jpg", "website": "http://www.redspritestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Red Sprite Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Red Sprite Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
