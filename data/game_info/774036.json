But this is a single player game. Maybe the outcome could be different in a multi-player game? I don't know. I feel very conflicted when I think about climate change. Why bother when rich people and big corporations are the ones to blame? But I can't avoid bothering. Sometimes. I try to lower my impact but sometimes I want to travel. Or eat a hamburger. I keep contradicting myself. This is what this game is about, kinda.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T19:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0ade43d42518b57c944c32566514fb22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N\u00faria"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
