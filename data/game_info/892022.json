Eventually, I\u00a0swapped it to Out of Time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have fixed the enemy pathing, and attacks. I made the enemy more aggressive, so it makes the game more challenging. I still need to setup some additional features, but so far the key mechanics are working.</p>\n<p>Move Keys:</p>\n<p>A, S, D, W</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button Click, allows you to attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shift allows you to sprint.</p>\n<p>Space Bar allows you to jump.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid the enemies, as they will reset your level.</p>\n<p>Holding the Right Mouse Button down allows you to manipulate the camera. This works better for controller, rather than console.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T08:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c02e994c7bf90b1e6ea830e7177ff8dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Console_of_Texas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
