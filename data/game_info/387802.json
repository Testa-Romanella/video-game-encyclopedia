One machine \"the Drill\" can mine the rock to get gold and fight back the enemy monsters but can't gather the gold. For that there is defenseless \"the Pickup\" machine.<br/>Get more gold to buy upgrades (lives and speed).</p>\n<p>Intended for one player using WASD and arrows or Gamepad, but you can cheat with friend and play it as co-op game.</p>\n\n<p>Source -\u00a0https://github.com/nezvers/Godot_3.1_Public_Examples<br/>Youtube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4-Y0E6mmwjtawcitIAzKQ<br/>Twitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/NeZversStudio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6aeec479c7943318d4822d61e50874.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nezvers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
