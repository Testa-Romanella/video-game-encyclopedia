{"id": 700859, "slug": "lost-knight", "name": "Lost Knight", "name_original": "Lost Knight", "description": "You find yourself in deep hole, in the dungeon, deep down under castle and you need to find a way up through levels of castle, rooms, catacombs and mu\u0441h more.<br/>\r\nYou are a small knight who can't remember who he is. Only thing you know that you need to reach top of the castle. You feel that there is an exit...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou, as a player, should run and jump your way up, facing some difficult parkour and some puzzles. There are also some fun parts and secrets which not every keen eye could find. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo not forget what is on shoulders. Yes, there is a head, but what else? Could be helmet? All knights know that helmets are the most important part (not really) of them. Helmet is a key.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you feel alone, don't be afraid to call your friend to this deep hole to try escape together. Don't worry if your friend isn't close (there is Remote Play Together *wink*)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCAUTION: This game is made to drive you out, but trust me there is an exit and that jump is possible, I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, my brave knight!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T03:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed7/ed7221535e470cd369949f7e613722a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ari1533", "OleNi Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pug Studio", "OleNi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
