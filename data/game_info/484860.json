As the miner, you must clear each level and progress- but be sure to watch out for the blobs!  Play through 130 levels, 30 in classic mode and 100 in arcade mode.  <strong>Classic</strong> mode sticks close to the game's namesake; Minetrap, a game which existed in the 90's (it does not exist anymore).  <strong>Arcade</strong> mode is the new, flashy version, complete with earthquakes, lava, dark levels, wind, coins, overly dramatic music, alternative objectives, crumbling levels, bosses, and more!  While in theory the game is simple, it is quite easy to end up in a bad position and die- there are death messages designed to enhance the user experience and provide encouragement for level progression.
