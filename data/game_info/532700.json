Well its not all that its made out to be! Ship systems malfunction CONSTANTLY. From the coffee machine to oxygen supplier, you need to prove to us that you have the skills to survive the onslaught of mechanical failures that you will have to face out in space.</p>\n<p>You'll also need to have some pretty thick skin. If you think having your life at risk constantly is bad, wait until you meet the Captain. He's got a bit of a\u00a0sailor's mouth, with years of sailing the vast reaches of space, learning how to insult his crew from the best of the worst across the galaxy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>So uh... ...Good Luck... ...you're gonna need it.
