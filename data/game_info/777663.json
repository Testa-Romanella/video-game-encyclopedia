(Right now there's only one gamemode so... just use the left and right arrows lol)</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------<strong>Versions:</strong></p>\n<p>0.1.0 [Previous Version]\u00a0=&gt; Prototype / early Alpha, only one gamemode. Almost nothing special.</p>\n\n<p>0.2.0 (Current Version) =&gt; This update mainly focused on making the game look better.\u00a0 You can call it the \"Design Update\".</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's new? (Differences from the previous version):</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Added stuff like backgrounds, FX, rotating effect for the falling squares, a new title and more...\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Added a\u00a0best\u00a0score counter, need some more fixes but is functioning fine. It saves your score\u00a0<strong>locally\u00a0</strong>so I still need to make the counter save your score even if you're exiting the game, maybe in the next update (0.3.0).</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Added new type of Square: Damage Square (its a red Square that deals damage and lowers your score).\r\n</p>\n<p>- Added sound effects (and in the next update there'll be music too).</p>\n<p>- Added new mechanic that allows you to go through one side of the screen and then\u00a0teleport on the other side of the screen.<br/></p>\n<p>- Changed the title of the game's window.</p>\n<p>- Bug fixes (Zero score bug)</p>\n<p>- Not a new thing inside the game itself but now you can download the previous versions of the game. I just think its nice lol.</p>\n<p>- You can play the game on your browser (although there's a bug that needs to be fixed that crashes the game whenever you click \"PLAY\" so just don't play in browser rn lol)</p>\n<p>and.... that's it basically.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Creator: QwertZero</p>\n<p>Programmer: QwertZero</p>\n<p>Testers: no one at the moment lol</p>\n\n<p>And thank you for playing the game!!</p>\n\n<p>Builds for HTML5, Mac and linux will be in the future!</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates, news and other stuff about the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Wb hvs waousg tczrsf hvoh wg zcqohsr wbgwrs hvs oggshg tczrsf, hvsfs'g ob waous ct o rwzrc hvoh wg hoysb tfca o rwgqcfr uwt, zcz.
