You can find his tutorial on YouTube:\u00a0CodeMonkey's KitchenChaos Tutorial. My game has several custom UI Screens that are not part of the tutorial and some minor game change tweeks.</p><p>The changes are mostly because I believe that learning happens best when you change the material slightly. This is because I believe you have to understand what is going on better if you make changes. So, I typically try and do that to all my follow along learning journeys.
