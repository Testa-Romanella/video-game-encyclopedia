For our CS4700.02 Game Development class at Cal Poly Pomona, our final project is\u00a0to take a classic game and put our own unique spin-off to it. Ever since we were younger, Space Invaders always had a place in our hearts.\u00a0 However, we realize that it is about time that a reboot should be released. Therefore, here is the second iteration of our game! As of now, there are still some leftover\u00a0bugs that we need to resolve. In addition, we still need to develop a clone of the classic version so many can see the vast advantage that our game has. We hope that you like it! The final version will be released around the finals week of our school.</p>\n<p>UNIQUE FEATURES/MECHANICS:\r\n</p>\n<p>-Avoid giant asteroids that head towards your ship\r\n</p>\n<p>-Avoid glowing orbs that disable your ship weapons for a few seconds\r\n</p>\n<p>-Try to catch all the shields that protect your ship from bullets for a period of time\r\n</p>\n<p>-Save up money to unlock another life, twice as much health, or even a burst missile firing system that will be more effective towards the aliens\r\n</p>\n<p>-Exotic music will play to keep you entertained\r\n</p>\n<p>-Alien AI is very challenging and move in its own unique direction\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4a44b8aad188175bc2010201c735323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Benjamin Mai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
