As the dragon attacks, they must avoid the attacks while shooting out the dragons vulnerable spots. Can you survive the encounter and make it safely to the ground?</p>\n<p>The game should only take about 5 minutes, including time for failures. It also requires a controller.</p>\n<p>This is only a prototype. I currently have no plans to adapt it further, but serves as a good starting place, should I decide later to adapt it into a full game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:00:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37d289d66861c082eb415e4c5c6ff32a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Van Zant"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
