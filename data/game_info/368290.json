It's instantly familiar, yet excitingly new and different!<br/><br/>The goal of Twistwris is to survive to score points, by clearing complete rows of blocks from around the cylinder. New block shapes relentlessly materialise near the top of the cylinder and slowly fall towards the bottom.\u00a0<br/><br/>The player can rotate the falling shape, and spin the cylinder, to manipulate it into an advantageous position and orientation on the cylinder surface. Rows of blocks are cleared when they form complete rings around the cylinder.<br/><br/>As the rings of blocks are cleared, the level increases and the shapes fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If a new shape materialises over an already existing block then the game ends!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T03:32:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed67efd3a326f6de4d832aa69cae2b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["James O'Kelly"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["James O'Kelly"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
