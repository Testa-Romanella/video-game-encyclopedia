In this project, a tumbleweed is rolling and bouncing around the Tilted Saloon, and you have to use the swinging doors to guide it to guide it to the end of the saloon, where it can go safely back to the desert, as oposed to\u2026 just falling anywhere into the desert i guess?</p>\n\n<p>In this pinball re-imagination, you have the actual objective to get the ball to the end of the level, not acumulating points or just keeping it alive, you\u2019ll guide it through several cool challenging obstacles, all keeping the pinball feeling and style, all themed in a Wild West saloon. Don\u2019t let the tumbleweed fall too early, guide it to the end of the saloon! though\u2026 i suppose it\u2019s gonna fall out there anyway in the end\u2026 oh well, try not to think about it too much!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>[[CONTROLS]]</strong></p>\n<p>Press any button to move the flippers on the entire game, press ESC to pause.</p>\n\n<p><strong>[[CREDITS]]</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Art]</em>\n</p>\n<p>- Nicholas Borghini</p>\n<p><em>[Programming and Game Design]</em>\n</p>\n<p>- Vitor Milioni</p>\n<p><em>[Music]</em></p>\n<p>- Preuss\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T00:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd7bb795f28177a8b3710e5d3f86c3fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nichow", "Vitor Milioni"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
