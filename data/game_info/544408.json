The goal is to reach as low floor as possible.</p>\n<p>You are a lone warrior heading deeper and deeper into the dungeon.\r\nIt is pitch black so you can't see what horrors hide in the darkness.\r\nOnly by walking through the room, one step at the time, you will reveal numbers\r\nthat indicate how many monsters are nearby.</p>\n<p>Once you've uncovered all tiles with no monsters you've cleared the room and\r\nthe doors to other rooms or if you are lucky the stairs down to the next level\r\nwill reveal itself.</p>\n<p>If you happen to step on a monster you have to fight it. Be careful though.\r\nWhen you fight monsters you lose health. When you've lost all our health\r\nthe game is over.</p>\n<p>Each time you fight a monster or clear a room you gain experience. Gain enough\r\nexperience and you gain a level and your health is replenished and you grow stronger.</p>\n<p>Control the player with the arrow keys (\u2191, \u2193, \u2190, \u2192). Click on buttons with the mouse.\r\nYou can use enter for some buttons.</p>\n<p>Released at Birdie 18.</p>\n<p>Code and gfx by snosscire.\r\nMusic by slundal.\r\nSndfx by bachler.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a8e3832ce48cfba9308bd4023025708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wedogames", "snosscire"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
