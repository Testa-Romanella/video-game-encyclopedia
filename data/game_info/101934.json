Use their different weapons and powers to crush anything that stands in your way, and explore the surrounding levels for hidden secrets. </p>\n<p>Bursting with vibrant art and interlocking stories, No Mercy draws both you and the characters deeper into the heart of a forest under attack. Your only hope lies in each other, but everyone has something valuable to lose. In a story of love, trust, and probably a few too many puns, you must work together to save the forest, your friends, or at the very least, your life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a06f97c35c61dd8e62990beb3c261f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Multivarious"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
