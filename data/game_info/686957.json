No one is denying their importance, but our fast-paced lives can sometimes lead to us\u00a0forgetting to take proper care of ourselves.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s where RescueBot comes in. A game that aims to remind us to take a break, to enjoy the little moments and don\u2019t lose sight of what\u2019s important. Our health. Happiness. And well-being.</p>\r\n\r\nKeyboard\u00a0 Controls\r\n<p><strong>SPACE, W, Up Arrow</strong> -- Jump</p>\n<p><strong>R, A, Down Arrow</strong> --Rescue</p>\n<p><strong>A, Left Arrow </strong>-- Slowing down</p>\n<p>Aspect Ratio <strong>16:9</strong> recommended!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This endless runner takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the humans were consumed by their stress and worries and mysteriously disappeared. The world is now inhabited by dangerous creatures and is filled with dangerous hazards.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>You play as RescueBot\u00a0and are tasked with surveying the city. But you better be careful, because RescueBot\u00a0is not a fighter! Besides your movement abilities you only have your Rescue-Move.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But what\u2019s the Rescue-Move for?\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout your journey you will encounter these mysterious shadowy figures. And these mysterious creatures are actually ... humans! Humans who lost sight of what\u2019s important in life and forgot to take proper care of themselves. But RescueBot is ready for this, and this is in fact the very reason why he travels around the now abandoned city. You can use your Rescue-Move when close to one of these enemies in order to save them! \r\n  </p>\n<p>Aim to positively influence as many people as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes the smallest gestures are the ones that matter the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout your journey you will find checkpoints (in the form of a fireplace where your RoboPals are relaxing). There you can simply use your Rescue-Move in order to take a break and take care of yourself. RescueBot will then be back to full health after spending some time relaxing, resting and being cared for by his pals.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Programmer</strong><br/>Max Giller</p>\n<p><strong>Artist</strong><br/>Mario Martinez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T03:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd2708a7b674d676df6c1dc567ff7f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Max", "Mario Mart\u00ednez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
