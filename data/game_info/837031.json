You get the chance to follow the  story of our heroine and make certain decisions. You can give the main  character your own first and last name. Each route has two endings, one  good and one bad. How the story ends depends on your decisions, as well  as which route you end up in.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Important! Please note that the game will  be released in<strong> German </strong>and if the funding on Kickstarer is successful, there will also  be an<strong> English text edition</strong>. Please understand that the English edition  will not be a professional translation. Due to the too high costs.  However, we will do our best to translate everything meaningfully.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you want to get an idea of the quality of the translation, feel  free to play the <strong>demo version</strong> of Connected through fate, which contains  the complete prologue.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game has an age rating from 16 years due to sexual as well as violent allusions.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You pay for the game once and have access to all content.\u00a0A Steam and Itch.io version will be released at launch.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Planned release of the game is in early 2023! <br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Connected through fate</strong> tells the story of our heroine, who is about to move with her mother to a new city. At her new school, she gets acquainted with the three strange Ichigawa brothers. The three brothers could not be more different, and so their first day is already extremely turbulent.</p>\n<p>But it's not just these strange encounters that will soon turn her entire life upside down!<br/></p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>The project </strong>is our first visual novel and  was started a few years ago and has continued to evolve after a long  break. Some stories want to be told to the end! So let us tell this  story and give you the opportunity to experience your chosen ending.\r\n  </p>\n<p>A lot of love and work went into this project. We want to get the  best out of our given resources and give you a unique experience.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>We will publish the game for Steam and  Itch.io in German. An English text edition will be released, if the  project will be funded on Kickstarter.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>With Connected through Fate</strong><strong> </strong>we want to tell  a deep, exciting but dramatic story. Through the four main characters  and a total of 8 different endings, the player will be able to explore  the characters and take his fate into his own hands. \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Kickstarter</strong> will get a beta access for the  game on Steam once Connected through fate launches into beta phase.
