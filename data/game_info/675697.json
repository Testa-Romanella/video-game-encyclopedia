And yeah, I ran out of time and I know that the math is terrible for how the generator works. :smile: </p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy the game!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/233c0e972c5a664c7a76aa768b965401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XeduR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
