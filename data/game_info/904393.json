With a team of 10 people including 2 GD and 8 3D, we created a 2-player speedrunner in 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>Our game was made on Unity 3D. All 3D models, animations and environment were made by the 3D team. The programming being done in 3 weeks is not complete, the race is finishable but the game is not and it surely contains bugs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Script pitch :</strong></p>\n<p>Jean and Oscar, both grandsons of the great adventurer Phil\u00e9as Fogg, have undertaken to take up the family challenge. To do so, they will have to follow in their grandfather's footsteps and finish the world tour in record time.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay pitch:</strong></p>\n<p>Play as Jean and Oscar, travel to all the iconic cities of the round-the-world trip in 80 days. Attempt to beat your brother in a race with many obstacles and set a new round the world record.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/6674f86025505504feed66452b00cc11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chloe24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
