It was created in 10 days for the JamCraft 5 game jam.<br/></p>\r\nInstalling\r\n<p>You can either download the Windows build below (standard Unity package) or you can run the WebGL build by clicking the Play button above.\u00a0WebGL build has been tested all the way through but YMMV.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Each level in Gastrocove involves scheduling your workers and then pressing Play to see if your schedule will earn the required amount of money in the allotted amount of time.</p>\n<p>There are three main crops in Gastrocove:\u00a0<strong>Coconuts</strong>, <strong>Sugarcane</strong>, and <strong>Coffee</strong>. Each crop grows best at a certain <strong>elevation </strong>and will take longer to grow otherwise. Additionally, the type of soil that you plant your crops in can increase or even decrease the required time before the crop is ripe.</p>\n<p>Later levels introduce <strong>appliances </strong>for crafting new food items such as an <strong>oven</strong>, <strong>grinder</strong>, and <strong>distillery</strong>. More complicated food items yield more money.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The controls in Gastrocove are very simple:</p>\n<p><strong>Pan Camera:\u00a0</strong>Middle Mouse Button + Drag or Left Click and Drag (while cursor is over non gameplay area such as the ocean)<br/><strong>Zoom:\u00a0</strong>Mouse wheel<br/><strong>Interact:\u00a0</strong>Left click</p>\n<p>Please note that for simplicity there is no camera movement (e.g. WASD) the camera always pans around the central point in the level and you can zoom in/out to get a better view.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Gastrocove uses the following free assets</p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Horticulture by Chequered Ink (I love this font)\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/horticulture.font\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>Bassa Island Game Loop by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3424-bassa-island-game-loop<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Click Sound http://soundbible.com/1705-Click2.html<br/>Fire Sound http://soundbible.com/1159-Fire.html<br/>Water http://soundbible.com/1126-Water-Drop.html<br/>Fireball http://soundbible.com/1359-Small-Fireball.html<br/>Mechanical Arm http://soundbible.com/1422-Mechanical-Arm.html<br/>Hammering http://soundbible.com/2028-Hammering.html<br/>Garbage Bag: http://soundbible.com/2118-Garbage-Bag.html<br/>Twitch http://soundbible.com/1138-Twitch.html<br/>Crumbling: http://soundbible.com/1886-Crumbling.html<br/>Bounce: http://soundbible.com/1120-Bounce.html<br/>AC: http://soundbible.com/343-Turn-On-Air-Conditioning.html<br/>Cuckoo Clock:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1261-Cuckoo-Clock.html<br/>Music Clock:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1619-Music-Box.html<br/>Toxic Goo:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1112-Toxic-Goo.html</p>\n<p><strong>Color Palette</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://lospec.com/palette-list/zughy-32</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Store</strong></p>\n<p>DOTween\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676</p>\n<p>POLYGON Starter by\u00a0Synty\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/polygon-starter-pack-156819</p>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<p>Skybox Shader\u00a0https://github.com/keijiro/UnitySkyboxShader</p>\n<p>Toon Water Shader:\u00a0https://roystan.net/articles/toon-water.html</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>I have always wanted to make a game that involved an island and crafting recipes. I also always knew it would be called Gastrocove. About 2 years ago, I even started working on game called Gastrocove for a few months which you can read about here\u00a0https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=g73jfo63lacus0c0lgmpq70cc3&amp;topic=64402.0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like most game dev projects, real life got in the way and it was forgotten about. I participated in a few LDJAMs and other game jams since then and when I saw the JamCraft 5 I thought it might be the perfect time to finally do something with the idea that would never leave my mind.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the result of the jam, this version is much different from the one I\u00a0previously built. I'm really not sure how the idea of scheduling robotic workers hit me but overall I'm very happy with the result of the past 10 days.</p>\r\nScreenshots", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:32:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399159b9fb7c826e9209f59ff19c1e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["morphinegames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
