Thanks so much for hosting the jam! I had a great time designing all the different rooms and setting the lighting for the scene.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Objective: You wake up in the middle of the night and you want a cup of water, but you're not supposed to leave your room. Find a cup and fill it with water before going back to bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: If you get locked somewhere or you're not sure what to do, there may be a bug where you accidentally locked yourself into a room, so just restart and try again. Feel free to leave a comment if that happens or any other bugs occur!</p>\n<p>Participants: Andrew Hsu, Stoew34, Zassimo(sfx!)</p>\n<p>Used asset packs from the Unity store and a prebuilt FPS controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Build 0.1 Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>-Currently there is no menu set up, so if you want to restart or if there is a bug, you'll have to restart the application.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Some doors don't have interactability yet and you can just phase right through them (two doors specifically), so you may want to try each door.</p>\n<p>-There IS\u00a0a way to technically win but due to time constraints, it doesn't show it. This will be included in the next build.</p>\n<p>If you want to let me know of any bugs, please comment below!</p>\n<p>***********************</p>\n<p><strong>Platform: PC (Sorry Mac users!)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Run - Shift + WASD</p>\n<p>Interact - Left mouse click</p>\n<p>Zoom - Right mouse click</p>\n<p>Crouch - Ctrl</p>\n<p>Jump - Space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/564525497ef40d359728915564cedd25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HuckCG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
