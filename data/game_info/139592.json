A mix of the clicker and RPG genres, and I quite like the idea myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344e71841537ef583fa3e1e544db8d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kobeDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
