Visit distant planets, interact with exciting locals, and undertake perilous missions for the space program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is available for free in text-only form, where it is about three pages long. The paid version is a one-page game that, dare I say, has a slightly prettier layout.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPACE CHIMPS\u00a0</strong>is largely inspired by the musical works of\u00a0<em>Clutch,\u00a0</em>in particular\u00a0<em>Spacegrass\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Escape from the Prison Planet,\u00a0</em>as well as\u00a0<em>Mobius Interactive's Outer Wilds.\u00a0</em>One additional shoutout goes to the Chilluminati Podcast community, where the initial idea was spawned earlier this morning.<br/><br/>Happy journeys!<br/>---</p><p>Minor update:\u00a0I realized I'd missed re-editing a few things in the artsy version, so I've quickly pushed a new version.
