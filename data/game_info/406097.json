Players take care of their plants in their greenhouse, while also venturing out to steal new plants from their neighbors. During these stealth sections, the player must carefully navigate past ever-watchful security cameras and cute, yet relentless, guard Pomeranians.</p>\n<p>The greenhouse section of the game, before and after every stealth section, gives the player a space to relax and feel at peace with their plants. Every plant can be watered and taken care of, and the plants retrieved from your neighbors can be named too.</p>\n<p>The visual style is colorful and soft, and the plants are huggable.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Steal plants to add to your greenhouse</li><li>Five unique plants to collect and love</li><li>Eleven pomeranians to chase you</li><li>Relaxing atmosphere</li><li>Show your plants\u2019 personalities by naming them</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Video</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Trailer</strong></p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/pgE3KCp8ceg</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Coding: Chloe Wohnoutka &amp; Josh Fickes</p>\n<p>Art: Chloe Wohnoutka &amp; Josh Fickes</p>\n<p>System Design: Chloe Wohnoutka &amp; Josh Fickes</p>\n<p>Level Design: Josh Fickes</p>\n<p>Sounds:</p>\n<p>Background Music: https://freesound.org/people/Slaking_97/sounds/459706/</p>\n<p>Birdsong: https://freesound.org/people/bajko/sounds/385280/#</p>\n<p>Lose SFX: https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/364929/</p>\n<p>Win SFX: https://freesound.org/people/shinephoenixstormcrow/sounds/337049/</p>\n<p>Pomeranian Bark: https://freesound.org/people/Cribbler/sounds/396307/</p>\n<p>Camera SFX: https://freesound.org/people/leviclaassen/sounds/107786/</p>\n<p>Coding Reference:</p>\n<p>https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_yUEnGQXM</p>\n<p>https://answers.unity.com/questions/438304/how-to-check-if-trigger-is-empty.html</p>\n<p>Animation Reference:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J38rJI5NNVI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:15:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/1025f17ad2172033ee68d777f96cf851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sombergraph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
