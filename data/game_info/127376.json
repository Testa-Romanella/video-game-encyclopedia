Online is not implemented yet!! We made the decision to create a small demo to put out, to show what we have and what we plan to do with this project, so expect bugs and issues.<br/><br/><strong><em>Mechanical Genocide:<br/><br/></em></strong>Mechanical Genocide is a vehicular combat game that focuses on small online, match making skirmishes, mostly 1 v 1. It is set in a post-apocalyptic setting in which we plan to do different environments for maps, not just dust and desserts.  <br/></p><p>The idea behind it is that the player's must utilize their vehicle's systems, weapons, and knowledge of map to obtain victory, some skill may be a factor as well. <br/></p><p>Vehicles are composed of three weapons, a front fixed weapon. a front gimbaled weapon, and a fixed rear weapon, an active system to aid you in combat, from boosted armor repairs to cloaking systems, and a deployable structure, from offense to supportive towers. <br/><br/>2 v 2 is planned, but not 100% sure about it. That's pretty much what this project is about and what we would like to do with it as we build it.<br/><br/><em><strong>Other:<br/></strong></em>We are also looking to fill some positions for people who would like to help/participate with the project and maybe grow with us as a team for future projects. Currently we need another 3d modeler and a concept artist.
