He ventures a few cities down, and gets locked in said \r\nhospital, unable to get out through the main exit. He drops his current \r\nassignment of getting a story for his newspaper, and focuses on one \r\nthing: Getting the hell out of this place.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\r\n However, the hospital is abandoned and empty. Nobody has entered\r\n it for 30 years. Blackwin is alone, stuck in an old, dark hospital. At \r\nleast, it seems you are.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Version:</strong> v00.00.004 <em>ALPHA </em><br/><br/></p>\n<p>&gt; The first builds released, currently v00.00.004 ALPHA, only includes the base <br/>game, Intro, and Level 1 and 2. This version will give you a quick preview of <br/>the game, and some of its mechanics, along with introducing you to the <br/>first part of the highly complicated story.</p>\n<p>&gt; We will be releasing newer versions slowly with new levels, \r\nmechanics, and more. Do expect new releases, and be sure to check back \r\nevery once in awhile for any!</p>\n\n\n<p>TIP: If the game closes/crashes, try opening it back up. It's likely intentional..</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccb/ccbbb8f3cb5cfc8ee1efa8e755db46be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ILMXStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
