You play as the embodiment of the soul and psyche that has ascended beyond our mortal plane, physically represented as a simple inanimate object: a teapot! Your soul however has taken on a darkness, burdened by fear. You must navigate your way through this mental prison, avoiding the manifestations of fear, cleansing yourself in areas of light. Only once you have rid yourself of this darkness will you be able to confront fear itself and reach a higher plane of existence.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong> WASD to move<br/><br/><em>All assets were created for the jam, during the jam.
