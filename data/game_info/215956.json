Using your magnet tongue, you rip the guns off of enemy ships when you get close enough. The fearsome belches produced by feasting on these fully loaded weapons clear bullets.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Gnorff is hungry. Use his magnet tongue to rip the tasty magnetic guns off of nearby ships and swallow them whole. Consuming the power sources from these guns gives Gnorff bad gas. Expelling it will cause all nearby bullets to explode.</p>\n<p>When Gnorff is running low on health, he can suck up green, magnetic-mineral-rich asteroids for a pick me up.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrows\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Movement<br/>Spacebar/Enter\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Burp<br/>R\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Restart<br/>Escape/Q\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0-Main Menu<br/><br/>Game made in UE4.
