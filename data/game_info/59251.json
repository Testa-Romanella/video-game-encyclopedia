Initially released in Japan and North America in late 2005, the game was later made available in Europe and the PAL region in early 2006. It is the first strategy-based installment of the series, using tactical, grid-based combat instead of the turn-based battles employed by previous games in the series. The game&#39;s music was composed by series veteran Norikazu Miura and features the opening theme &quot;Another World&quot; performed by Japanese vocalist yoshiko.<br />\nThe game&#39;s fantasy story is told in two parts, taking place both before and after the events of Suikoden IV released one year earlier, and features appearances by characters from the title.
