{"id": 466538, "slug": "vermilion-prison", "name": "Vermilion Prison", "name_original": "Vermilion Prison", "description": "Information:\r\n<p>Vermilion Prison is a 2D top-down shooter in which every time<strong> 20 seconds</strong> pass a new <strong>event</strong> will happen. Events vary from window resize to reversed controls and many more (<strong>you need to play it to find out the rest</strong>).</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\nMovement:\u00a0\r\n<p>WASD keys or the ARROW keys</p>\r\nShooting:\u00a0\r\n<p>Left Mouse Button</p>\r\nPause:\u00a0\r\n<p>Escape key</p>\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n1) My antivirus detects this game. It this a virus?\u00a0\r\n<p>No, It's really not. The game messes with things like the game window so that's why.</p>\n<p>Here's the VirusTotal\u00a0scan if you still don't believe me .</p>\r\n2) I got the same event 2, 3, 4... times in a row\r\n<p>The events system is fully based on RNG. That's why an event can happen multiple time in a row. Is improbable to happen more then 3 times but it's still possible.</p>\r\n3) Why can't I play in fullscreen?\r\n<p>Short answer: because of the way the game was made (maybe I will fix this in the future)</p>\r\n4) Why didn't you build\u00a0a web version?\r\n<p>The game couldn't work if it was web based. If you play it you'll understand why.</p>\n\r\nCredits for the music:\r\n<p>Follow Kraedt:<br/></p>\n<p>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Kraedt<br/>Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/kraedt<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/Kraedt<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Kraedt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed597c7d1e0ec4ea41cc878dd983363b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Painite\u30c4"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
