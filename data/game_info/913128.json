Was trying to figure out booster animations and sounds when I decided to start learning Godot instead so I left it at this. Maybe I'll \"port\" it to that engine\u00a0and build it out a bit for a sort of sequel at some point. There's a little bit of fun and challenge to be had so I thought why not put it up.</p>\n<p>Very basic but pretty much functional :)</p>\n\n<p>*controls are keyboard only</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0e85ea4772da7ed17621347f8b51476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["half-Baked Boat shop"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
