This dungeon was one long hallway, filled to the brim with monsters, traps, and treasure, but nobody's ever gotten to the end, or at least came out to tell the tale. Can <em>you</em> make it?</p>\n<p>Unnecessarily Complicated Dungeon Crawler hearkens back to the days of old: when games had way too many stats, items, and text. Of course, UCDC refits this to fit the modern era, with slightly less frustrating exactness and a battle system that isn't in first person, but rather, a top down view.</p>\n<p><em>This game is in open beta and is being actively developed.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e0bc53edfdf447bc79d9f3ec6d8ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Kevster Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
