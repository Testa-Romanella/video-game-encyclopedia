It was a mid-semester project, we were only supposed to spend a week on it but I stayed up two nights in a row to get it finished. The music is from Newgrounds since I can't do music, but I did the rest of it all myself (art, programming, \"design\" etc.)<br/><br/>I was pretty happy with how this turned out and this game evokes the feelings that got me really excited for game development, back in the day. It's really important for me to revisit that to remember where I wanted to go in game development, so I figured I should at least make it public since it's still playable.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/36338c3afb92489107419db1a7902d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Knight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
