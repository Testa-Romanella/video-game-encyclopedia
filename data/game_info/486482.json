Each wave is more difficult than the previous one, with more powerful zombies and a bigger number of them. You control a party of main characters, each of them represented not by a human, but by a weapon. You decide which weapon of the party to manually control at any time, while being able to give directions to the rest of them on how to behave. There is a total of 10 weapons, which you have to find across the level, hidden in randomly located chests. When the zombies kill all the weapons in the party, the game is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18636a6e99c1d1da1bd0bf465703dad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antonio Marco Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
