There are growing zones that make the block grow bigger and shrinking zones that make it grow smaller.</p><p>As you get larger you also jump higher but you'll become an easier target for stray projectiles and you'll be unable to move through certain paths. On the other hand if you become too small you won't jump very high. Try to get your size right.</p><p>If you spot any bug please leave a comment. Especially collision bugs.</p><p>Keys -&gt; Z = Jump, X = Change direction</p><p>Entry for Ludum Dare 34: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=e...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34ba0941d2f8428f2fef3719f6bed3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndreSilvs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
