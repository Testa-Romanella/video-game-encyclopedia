In cast, you need to play an actor and complete one performance after another. You need to switch back and forth in the three scenes, jump over obstacles, avoid fort, and let your shadow reach the end of each scene. This is the shadow of actors, shuttling in every dimension; This is our shadow, this is our love for the game; This is the shadow of each \"you\", switching in different scenes and meeting different challenges at different times, just like your shadow, crossing the bumps and reaching a new stage of life. Suddenly looking back, the applause rang out, the lights fell, the actors were in place, the shadow moved with the shape, and life was like a play.</p>\n<p>Cause all the developers are sophomores and poor at English\u00a0so that this game is not that polished. But, we are still developing this game. This game will soon be posted on the steam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c2c04d00fb36fdf1d3bb74719204014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CareEJoken"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
