The levels are timed to increase the challenge. Starting in the carnival tent try to hit as many targets as you can in the time you have allowed in each level. The upper levels take place outside the carnival tent which will make things more interesting! Test your skills on not on stationary but moving<br/>targets. See how good of a shot you really are!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af81f5d724f48f0ca43d6f0f4d56c4e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thornbury Software"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
