You have to wait a while for the colorful ENTERPRISE logo then press a key.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0To load Flooder click on File, Load Snapshot, then select FlooderEP128.ep128s\r\n  </p>\n<p>You are now ready to RUN the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Its the well-known Flood-it game: press the numbers to paint the stage to the same color. Press F when you finished. I you see Fail, you loose, else you will see your points (less \"move\" earns more points).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Now press Reset or F11 and run the program again for the next \"stage\". Each stage has random difficulty, displayed by border color. You can use more or less keyboard (=color) to do the job.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The ELAN Enterprise 128 has very advanced BASIC but that BASIC has many limitations. It makes the \"10 line limit\"\u00a0 progamming quite difficult: FOR...NEXT, IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF, and other commands (LOOK, PING for ex.)\u00a0 cannot use multiple in one line, or maybe the end of the line. Because of this i have to use some tricks: the program contains only one for-next an one if..then command pairs. Thats why it is possible only one game/run, then you have to reset the computer, and run the program again.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There is a hidden level in the game, just delete the \"!\" from the end of line 1.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Keys:   </p>\n<p>0...8(9) (depends the level, check the colors)\r\n  </p>\n<p>F - finish the stage (then the program will check the blocks\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Program lines:\r\n  </p>\n<p>1 - set the graphic mode, colors, reset the variables, and random level\r\n 2 -5   </p>\n<p>E=1 - fill the field (line 4), E=0 - check the fields remaining (line 3, \"C\")\r\n  </p>\n<p>6 - read a key / print \"Fail\" and points, but in black color until the end of the game, then if c=0, Point has color, else if c&gt;0 \"Fail\" has color and shows.\r\n  </p>\n<p>7 utilize the keypresses : paint the color depends the key, and add 1 to p variable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>8 if \"f\" pressed, starts to paint black (=0 for the LOOK command), GOTO2 with E=0 : check the fields and add colors if not black.\r\n  </p>\n<p>9 endif   </p>\n<p>10 goto 6 to read a key, and print the keys with colors. there is a 3 line limitation so i cant show the 9th color, it will be the hidden part.\u00a0 Also i cant use another FOR command, so this line caused that this \"less than PUR80\" program can enter only to the PUR120 category.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Have fun!\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T04:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3912b90d180809da7dc81c0d1e0083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
