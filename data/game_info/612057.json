I finally have enough of a working prototype to share.</p>\n<p>Included in this build is\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Sonic Advance </strong>(released in 2001 in Japan)\u00a0 that I used to test the emulator during the build. To play it\u00a0just turn on the power at the bottom of the console. I've implemented all the instruction sets needed by this ROM, so\u00a0 in theory it should work for other game ROMs as well, although I haven't tested enough to be sure. To load your own ROM\u00a0click the '...' on the bottom right corner of the game window.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Drag your mouse to rotate the console. Left click on any of the buttons on the 3D console\u00a0or use the associated key on your keyboard.</p>\n\r\nEnhancements\r\n<p>If there is enough interest in this prototype, these are some of the features that can be added in future builds:</p>\n<ul><li>Custom keyboard mappings</li><li>Gamepad support</li><li>Volume controls</li><li>Zoom controls</li><li>Pixel smoothing</li><li>Zip support</li><li>Improve 3D model &amp; textures</li><li>Case\\button customization</li><li>Game Boy Advance SP 3D model</li><li>Save game states</li><li>Cartridge models</li><li>ROM library management</li><li>Support\u00a0Game Boy and Game Boy Color ROMs</li><li>Desktop version</li></ul>\r\nReferences\r\n<ul><li>Game Boy\u00a0Advance Architecture\u00a0by\u00a0Rodrigo\u00a0Copetti</li><li>Game Boy Advance Technical Reference\u00a0by\u00a0GBATEK</li><li>Techniques for Emulation Programming\u00a0by\u00a0Victor Moya Del\u00a0Barrio</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378af0b5ebeaedfe1e5d0f91e56715f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
