It's more survival or action than strategy. That said, you'll find some strategy to be had in defending your stuff. City building was never my strong suit... :d<br/></p>\n<p>Hint: use shift + S to get a save code. You can paste this into any other instance of the game, click off the textbox, press ctrl+L and it -should- put you exactly where you were when you saved! \\^-^/ It's a placeholder, don't worry. <br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>By the way, the version is the approximate amount of finishedness. a050 would mean it's about half way to being a 1.0 release. I will probably keep developing it after full (r1) release though. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Join the Discord!</strong> https://discord.gg/8fWrcAF <br/>Also roadmap thing to see what features I want to add.<br/>If you want to boost my development a bit, please go ahead and donate! Even the smallest contribution goes a long way, plus you get the downloadable version. I will likely put up a Patreon soon for those who want to get involved. <br/></p>\n<p>version a020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13dc800a3c4488baec301118373d60f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sumyjkl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
