Mixing fast-pased gameplay and intense synthwave music for a full body experience that will rival any gym session!<br/>(Music by the amazing\u00a0producer\u00a0MegaHit -\u00a0https://www.megahit.hu/en/)</p>\n<p>In SynthRunner you will duck, dive and dance your way through each song in a fight for the highscore. Grab pickups to boost your score and try not to lose all your lives or it is GAME OVER for you in this energetic 80\u2019s styled rhythm extravaganza.</p>\n<p>SynthRunner comes with three difficulty settings with the ability to turn off pickups so you can tailor your experience perfectly to yourself or others! SynthRunner currently comes with five songs which are picked at random each time you play, however I am looking in to a custom music feature so you can use your own music in game!</p>\n<p><strong>YOU WILL NEED STEAM VR INSTALLED AS WELL AS A HTC VIVE OR OCULUS RIFT IN ORDER TO RUN THE PROJECT.</strong></p>\r\nHow much is SynthRunner?\r\n<p>SynthRunner is $2.99 (Roughly \u00a32.46) and this is for a reason, in my time of creating VR games and experiences it has become clear to me that even as a solo developer, I can create viable products for an affordable cost to the consumer unlike most studios or even AAA studios. VR games do not need to be expensive!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58acfc77913cdbce4cb2d2c62cf09add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoidVR"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
