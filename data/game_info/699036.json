In every bullet, we strive to make sense of our actions. The fall of fate, the rise of depression. The blind night puts a curtain over our eyes to keep our screaming conscience at bay. Do they not realize this is the end of the world? We see death in reflections, and it seeks for our eyeblink. We've arrived at the point where we're battling it till we die. As the moon's leaves descended, we jumped off the train of history.

I am the one who dwells in the depths of your soul and mind. Those who don't know how to forget every now and again perish from memory stress, you know that? No, no. Don't think about death. The image of death is a good dance companion. What about to listen a song? Can you hear the sound? Look, tick-tock-tick-tock, time is ticking! Keep an eye out for shadows; I'll be waiting for you. <br/><br/>Do you believe the war is over in the mind, rather than with the guns?

Contribute to the game's progress by captivating your opponents' minds with our character, built for the players who say \u201cManipulation is my thing!\u201d  <br/><br/>Although Indoles is a close-combat character, one's ranged abilities and rapid movement speed make one ideal for chasing down your opponents.<h3>\"This is war\", said the great ancestor.</h3><br/>What a futile endeavor. We kept an eye on you, trusted you, and left you with a wonderful world. However, you? You, poor humankind, have succumbed to your conceit. You have spilt your own brother's blood, and drawn a line in the earth, and claimed what didn't belong to you. With the promise of a good future, you fooled yourself and sold your soul to the matter. You grew up, and as you matured, you launched war on those who were different from you. We accept your war. We are approaching, and we will catch you off guard when you are alone with your fears and feel the most alone. Until there is no one left to remember you and you were never born.<br/><br/>Become one of the Ancestors, whose mysteries and how long they have existed are beyond our comprehension. With your psychic abilities, dehumanize the forest and restore the order you previously had. It entirely depends on you to save modern life from destroying nature and your species.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T03:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/84133f5451d53694069f7e183c87ec59.jpg", "website": "https://www.venatiogame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ludos Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ludos Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
