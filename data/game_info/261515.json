Although the view is limited, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty to explore; a wide gamut of puzzles and amusing sights are strewn in almost every pixel of this charming scene. Gameplay is simple: point and click to zoom in and out, examining objects and deciphering codes until you've opened every lock. Game's typical user-friendly interface makes navigation easy so you can sink all your mental powers into finding your way out the door. While a few answers will be staring you straight in the face, you'll also be expected to infer some solutions based on a number of rather vague clues. The HINT button will give you just that: another hint to throw into the mix of information while still leaving the credit for solving the puzzles squarely on your shoulders alone. <br/><br/>Good luck and have fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe0480a7f639f8ed7a6f7ba8498a2d86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Longwei Yang"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Longwei Yang"], "esrb_rating": null}
