Hashimoto, a.k.a. Buster, and released on his website. The original game was entirely in Japanese, but saw a translation patch months after its original creation.</p>\n<p>The game hearkens back to early &quot;Metroidvania&quot; games like Knightmare II: The Maze of Galious and Legacy of the Wizard: the player explores an immense maze-like dungeon, collecting tools and keys that allow them to proceed deeper. Certain areas are cordoned off from the main dungeon area, and each presents a more linear zone with a boss at the end. The player can find new equipment to make themselves stronger as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-02T02:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0b6b0a77d74d11cf1d770e3efbf7563.jpg", "website": "https://www.rgcd.co.uk/2012/01/hydra-castle-labyrinth-pc.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
