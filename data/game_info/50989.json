It's time for you to learn what really goes on inside!<br/><br/>In this bizarre, yet somehow familiar environment live small digital life-forms called Hexters. It is your role to assist these little guys and learn about bits, bytes, polygons and hexadecimals (it's all nonsense by the way).<br/><br/><br/>Meet some helpful programsInteresting and quirky programs will help you to unlock the secrets of the Cyberscape.<br/><br/><br/>Build and expandStart from a meager Hub - the center of your operations - and plan your expansion. Everything must be connected to your node network for power to flow.<br/><br/><br/>Power is lifeNothing works in this world without power, and there are only so many computational cycles available. Make sure you always have enough of them to power up your buildings, otherwise bear the consequences of inefficiency.Extract, collect, refine and improveFind all the resources available to you and build refineries, extractors, polysmiths and other buildings to improve them.Day &amp; Night cycleEven inside a computer it can get scary when it's dark. Hexters prefer to stay inside the base perimeter during the night, and move slowly outside with their flashlights while figuratively pooping their pants (which incidentally has no visual nor mechanical representation whatsoever). Hope you generate enough power as you need to recharge your illumination probe for night to end.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way: During the night... There be dragons.<br/><br/><br/>Fight backThere's all kinds of problems inside a computer, like viruses and glitches. And those things wants you GONE, permanently.
