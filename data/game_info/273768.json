A high score chaser where you play as a little dragon navigating a dangerous dungeon in search of loot to take back to your treasure hoard. Grow larger as you collect coins, gems, and other valuable items to increase your score multiplier in order to gain even more points in your pursuit of a high score. Be Careful though, should you run into any obstacle or wall, you\u2019ll end your run. Your score multiplier is based on your Dragon length, thus you must reach full size to add a score multiplier effect, and before you see gems and better items appear beyond the classic coins. If you run into yourself at any time, you will sacrifice your body at the point of impact causing you to lose your score multiplier and have to build it back up, but you will be able to continue your high scoring run. When you die, you will be offered the opportunity to sacrifice some of your collected loot, in the form of your best items, the things you have worked so hard for and the things you treasure the most, to continue your run. To achieve your highest score, decisions will be presented, and sacrifices must be made.</p>\n<p>Hungry Hungry Dragons uses hand drawn pixel art. Moving forward with the game, we plan on expanding out the roster of Dragons to showcase many more Dragon looks and styles created by our artists. These Dragons can be collected by hatching eggs acquired in game using the coins collected. At certain intervals throughout the game, the Dragons can actually grow and mature into large adult Dragons. </p>\n<p>Dungeon rooms in Hungry Hungry Dragons are procedurally generated offering different runs every playthrough. Pre-designed rooms will also be created to offer a more challenging experience, with some of these rooms even offering up puzzle like conditions to escape to the next room. </p>\n<p>In Hungry Hungry Dragons, the Dragon with the largest treasure hoard is the best. You\u2019ll be able to compete against fellow Dragons and show off your highest scoring treasure hoard complete with all the special and rare items you\u2019ve found along the way. </p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this small demo of Hungry Hungry Dragons as there is so much we have lined up for the complete full version. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>- Credits -\u00a0<br/></strong>Kelly Maguire &amp; Todd Juneau: @appatheia</p>\n<p><strong>Designer</strong><br/>Josh Johnson: @Josh_L_Johnson</p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong><br/>Sam Franco: @sam.racoon<br/>Alea Staley: @leiya_art<br/><br/><strong>Engineer<br/></strong>John Otis: @JohnROtisJr</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Artist</strong><br/>Miguel Torres: @wholesalebirbs<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>\"Cruising for Goblins\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703f82fc36c551bd65fc1af6c4a101bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["appatheia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
