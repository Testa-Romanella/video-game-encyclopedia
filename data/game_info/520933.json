The catch is that their language is entirely gestural. You must therefore learn the gestures with corresponding English meanings, and move your avatar accordingly to speak the tongue. You will be given a phrase to translate, begin recording, start moving into each pose (hold each gesture for about a second!), then stop the recording and you will be told if you successfully translated the phrase and if not, what you ended up saying instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T04:56:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/5778ee81285bfefa6e61a267bc1f2ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charly Yan Miller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
