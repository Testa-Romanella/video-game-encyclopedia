Players\u2019 time will stay put if they are inside a special moving area locating close to the map center. In this area the one who owns most resources will be marked by system and seen by others. The marked player\u2019s team will win victory directly if he could survive for 3 minutes and keep his resources always the most one during that time period. So the tactical strategy of time point and location to enter the moving area are very important. As the circle keeps moving, there\u2019s no persistent blindage to offensive and defensive sides.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3b278fd76e2fedd5483268c08a32da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cerberus Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Snail Games USA"], "esrb_rating": null}
