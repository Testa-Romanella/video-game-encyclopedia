That isn't very hard. However, imagine that in said country there is no one that shares your views on the world. Imagine you had the power to change it.</p><p>Imagine your phone was your only tool, and that all you did to improve your situation had to be handled through it. Imagine checking your Parliament's composition, how your co-citizens thought of you, all through apps.</p><p>Imagine going to protests. Imagine giving interviews. Imagine chatting with fellow citizens and improving their views on your views.</p><p>Now stop imagining. Because a phone is all you need.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p><p>Jes\u00fas Baena: developer and game designer</p><p>Mario Bizcocho: head developer and game designer</p><p>Eva Rivero: 2D artist</p><p>Sam Woodfin: SFX and music (music not yet included)</p><p><strong>Special thanks:</strong><br/></p><p>University of Seville, for its facilities at the Computer Engineering School's basement</p><p>Serious Games, for their support and shared knowledge (or ignorance, rather) about game development</p><p>Juan Dom\u00ednguez Jara, for some valuable help with planning and some tricky algorithms</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/ced3d165fa26e3faf7b06e607515f52d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarioBG3"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
