{"id": 19430, "slug": "dragon-age-origins-awakening", "name": "Dragon Age: Origins Awakening", "name_original": "Dragon Age: Origins Awakening", "description": "<p>Dragon Age: Origins Awakening is an expansion pack to fantasy game Dragon Age: Origins developed by BioWare.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s story continues where Dragon Age: Origins ended. The protagonist becomes a commander of the order of The Gray Knights which acquire a manor in their protectorate. The players arrive at the castle, where the creatures of the Darkness still attack humans even after the murder of their leader. The Knights find information that several Darkness creatures became sentient and began their investigation.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s core mechanics are largely the same as the base game with several additions. Now the players have to take care of the land in their possession, making decisions about building up new defenses (by looking for ores and purchasing new buildings). </p>\n<p>The story takes 10 to 15 hours to complete. There are many side quests present in the game apart from the main story. Unlike the base game, you cannot romance any of the Knights as there is no love story whatsoever in the expansion pack.</p>\n<p>The players are free to create whatever character they like, but the story does not depend as much as it did on the player character&#39;s race. There are three specializations with several classes in them. That makes it very easy for the players to create a character to fit their own playstyle.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2010-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:47:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/736/736e1e2e7670169114a48b5f65f66bdb.jpg", "website": "http://dragonage.bioware.com/dao/game/order-ultimate/", "rating": 4.45, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 68, "owned": 726, "beaten": 460, "toplay": 53, "dropped": 33, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 396, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 396, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PC", "macOS", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["BioWare"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
