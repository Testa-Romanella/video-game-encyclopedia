In centuries after that, while the outside grew more and more hostile, Govnograd extended skyward, with its inhabitants building more and more layers of the city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Top levels of the metropolis\u00a0are occupied by normal law-abiding citizens, who were lucky enough to be born into wealthy families, but two bottom layers - Slums and Slumy Slums, are inhabited by low-lifes, criminals and con-men. Just like yourself.</p>\n<p>You are a lucky native of\u00a0Slumy Slums (as lucky as you can be, considering...) and an entrepreneur. You had just saved up enough money to get an illegal business license from the city's official\u00a0mob boss, and to buy a promising estate to produce knock-offs of famous brands. The only thing is - you don't have enough left to hire any actual staff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's when the idea hits you - cheap child labor! You take your trusty lasergun, hop into the sewers and make your way to the most crime-infested areas of the Slumy Slums, to rescue poor orphans from awful life on the streets. give them roof over their heads, and a purpose in life - bring You some sweet profit! And also to exterminate some dangerous individuals along the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b8954cb154f3bb43be82156c1e9269a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Huggetz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
