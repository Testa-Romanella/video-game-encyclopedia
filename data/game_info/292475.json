Every decision you make will have consequences. You will receive character points and romance points for every decision you make. The points determine the course of your game and how your romance develops, as well as the outcome of your story.</p>\n<p>As an example: You are always unfriendly to your colleagues at work, so you will never have the option to decide if you want to go for a drink after work with them. This scene is withheld from you and you go home immediately. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Warning:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Boy's Love, mature content (18+), sex being portrayed uncutted, bad / vulgar language, sexual innuendo.</p>\n<p>Whether it has sexuality or not because the story deals with adult and maybe triggering subjects in general:</p>\n<p>Sexual abuse, (domestic) violence, trauma, mental health, rape, character death.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Even if the warning sounds a bit gloomy, you will see more homorous scenes than tragic ones.
