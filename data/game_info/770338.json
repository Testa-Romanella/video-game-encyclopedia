In this project you'll be \r\ngiven a  meat suit and you'll be in charge of making vital and unimportant choices! To start \r\njust click the  green flag on screen.  \r\nWe would like to state that this experiment is still \r\nin alpha so only the first chapter (or as it's  called, a save file) but in the full release \r\nthere will be a total of 6 save files!   This is technically a RPG/visual novel crossover, \r\nbut because most of the RPG elements (like  battling) come in later, I categorised it as visual novel.  \r\n<p>Music is on the soundtrack (I'm still adding to it but the songs are all there)\r\n</p>\n<p>I did all the coding in Scratch because I'm useless at any other programming language.</p>\n<p>Also on Newgrounds:\u00a0oooooooooooo</p>\n<p>Download (Mediafire):\u00a0ooooo<br/></p>\n<p>Credits to my brother for being the first alpha tester (despite him only clicking the printer and not actually progressing)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T11:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc6464ba04771748088beefe36837fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PearlHikara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
