The theme of the jam was Mixing Genres and we accomplished this by combining a retro shooter inspired by Missile Command with a typing game.</p>\n<p>Protect the city from the perils of outer space! Asteroids are falling and aliens are firing. Man the orbital defense platforms and see how long you can fend off the hostile waves of enemies. <br/></p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>Type the words that appear below the asteroids and alien spacecraft to target them with your lasers. Destroy glowing green asteroids that contain nuclear material to bolster your nuclear armament. Type \"nuke\" followed by the launch code to deliver a devastating attack that clears the screen giving you time to regroup. When all of the buildings have been destroyed it's game over.
