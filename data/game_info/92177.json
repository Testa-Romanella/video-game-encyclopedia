Whenever you need you can freeze time, draw whatever you want, unfreeze the time and play with it!  Make your way through the levels, avoid obstacles and solve puzzles, but be mindful of the ink or it will run out. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>I will provide updates as often as I can. With new updates expect bug fixes,  more polish and, hopefully, I will be able to add a story mode.</p>\n<p>Hope you like the game, have fun!</p>\n<p>Feel free to contact me if you want to report bugs, ask something about the game, or just say hi.</p>\n<p>You can also download it on Android and IOS.<br/></p>\n<p>My email: callmevladislav@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter for updates: vladmaxli<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff9594eda02730c707e99849678af614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vladmax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
