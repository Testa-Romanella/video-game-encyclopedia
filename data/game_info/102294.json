FEEL THE NAUSEA, THE FRUSTRATION OF BEING UNABLE TO OPEN DOORS OR FIRE GUNS. BE TRAPPED IN <strong><em>E1M1</em></strong>. ALONE, TOGETHER WITH <strong><em>AFFINE TEXTURE MAPPING</em></strong>. WIW WOW.</p><p>DO NOT LOOK AT THE FLOOR.</p><p>This is a partial recreation of E1M1 from 1993's DOOM, relentlessly lathered with Burning North's <em>Flashback '94</em> for extra nausea. I mostly just wanted to see how it'd look with affine texture mapping and vertex snapping (PS1-era hell), but also saw the recreation as a fun exercise in modelling, texturing, and making quick prototypes in Unity.</p><p>The entire project took about a week. Three days for the level (had to be remade from scratch twice), three evenings for the DOOM logo model, and everything else was done inbetween!</p><p><strong>Assets used:</strong></p><ul><li>ArtLeaping \u2014 Camera Perspective Editor</li><li>Burning North \u2014 Flashback '94</li><li>UnityCoder.com \u2014 Doom Style Billboard Shader (GitHub)</li><li>Hutong Games \u2014 PlayMaker</li></ul><p>You can find me on Twitter at @Hey_Its_Lollie!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a75dbf8cb34bb860ee810e1ca38f444f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lollie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
