After that, it will be available to purchase for $2.\u00a0</p>\r\nHelpful Hint:\r\n<p>If replaying the game from the beginning in order to see all the different endings is too tedious, you can press the S key at most points in the game to save :3 Then you can reload and play from there. Sadly, if you save near to or during a timed choice, it can sometimes result in a bugged save, that when loaded, will cause the game to become very laggy for some reason &gt;.&lt;</p>\r\nVoice Talent:\r\n<p>Male Voice 01 - Anthony Rodriguez -\u00a0anthonyrodriguezvo.com<br/>Male Voice 02 - Seth Heart -\u00a0twitter.com/SethHeartVA<br/>Female Voice 01 - Danuta Marie -\u00a0https://twitter.com/MinaMinaVA<br/>Female Voice 02 - Lindsay Marie -\u00a0https://www.castingcall.club/m/Lindsay%20Marie</p>\r\nOther Stuff:\r\n<p>There are probably some little bugs since I haven't had time to do extensive testing due to the submission deadline for the jam. I will post about any bugs\u00a0I find when I get a chance. If you happen to spot any that I haven't listed, please let me know so I can add them + fix them :3 I don't have a mac to test on, so I have literally no idea if the mac version even runs &gt;.&lt; I know mac + Tyrano don't like each other very much though :( I know that using the skip text function can cause issues/crashing! Also, messing about with the volume controls in config can result in odd volume levels... I dunno why, I use Tyrano's default config options but they must be broken. I don't think quicksave or quickload work either for some reason (another Tyrano thing I dunno how to fix!)</p>\n<p>Some jam feedback has mentioned that the shower scene + some of the transitions at a certain point in the game could do with being sped up, so I will make sure to do that once the jam is finished :3</p>\n<p>I also want to say a huge thanks to the voice actors for volunteering their talent to help bring this project to life :D</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game! Happy Halloween \\^_^/</p>\n<p>Edit Notes:</p>\n<p>I am uploading a new set of files cos I noticed an annoying typo in the old ones, haha.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Shortcuts:</p>\n<p>S = Save<br/>L = Load<br/>M = Open Menu<br/>T = Return to title screen<br/>A = Begin auto text mode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:21:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0e/c0ed279cfce9adbef0e7da59741b6be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Melancholy Marionette"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
