This is an indie dev pre-alpha game, so all your feedbacks are welcomed!</p>\n<p>2. There are some bugs ahead! So please do hesitate to tell us about their existence in the comments below!</p>\n<p>3. There are only 10 levels as of yet \u2013 but worry not, those levels will give us the necessary amount of feedback required for adding more in-game features and levels soon.</p>\n<p>4. Like any other great game on its pre-alpha build, there are not many visual assets in the game at this stage of development</p>\n<p>5. And as a final note: this current version doesn\u2019t include a final level with a big bad evil boss and advanced level mechanics \u2013 but we\u2019re confident you\u2019re going to enjoy yourself playing through the levels!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T06:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f2a8debb288f75e6dcbc7e0c113ca0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedro_Silva2761"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
