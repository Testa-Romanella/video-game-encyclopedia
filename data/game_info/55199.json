The primary target is a number of Mega-Mines, which approach the Earth and must be destroyed. The game is level-based (there are 36), and after all the Mega-Mines are destroyed the game progresses to the next level where players encounter a growing variety of enemy attack ships, with different speeds and offensive capabilities. An animated cut-scene is played every four levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f43/f43a119c63ef7be3b2f68aee136f1777.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 5200", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["First Star Software"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["First Star Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
