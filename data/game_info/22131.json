And for a long time he ruled the Kingdom just because the lazy and well prospering animals didn\u2019t care about politics. Years have passed as fast as new budget cuts were appearing. But what struck the animals in the Kingdom was the reform of public media. Bigger license fee?! Oh, we will not tolerate that! But thankfully there was a law, or maybe a so called a hole in law, that let any animal challenge current ruler. The only detail, that the cat Leonidas didn\u2019t notice was the fact that it was in fact an open tournament. So it wasn\u2019t long before more contenders appeared to claim the throne for their own reasons.<br/>So it\u2019s time to sharpen your claws and fangs, prepare your hair and nail \u2013 the fight is about to Begin!<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes:</strong><br/><br/>Collector - you will get a random set of items to collect as fast as you can and bring them to your table.

But beware of the traps on the stage! <br/><br/>Catcher \u2013 try to catch most of the cannonballs fired by the cannons! But remember \u2013 enemies never sleep.
