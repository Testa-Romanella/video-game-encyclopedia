It's a very tiny city builder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think everything should be clear from the get-go, but I will still go over the main elements of the game:</p>\n<ul><li>when the game starts, you'll have 4 villagers</li><li>build structures to produce wood, iron, food from the natural resources spread across the map</li><li>buy/sell resources as you see fit</li><li>your people will slowly consume the food stored</li><li>if you run out of food, they will start dying because of the famine</li><li>if they all die, that will mark the end of Square Town</li></ul>\n<p>The goal of the game is to build the Tower.T o do so, you will need resources aplenty, a sizable population and your village needs to have survived for some time. This will put to test your management skills.</p>\n<p>To control the camera, hold down the right mouse button and move the cursor.</p>\n<p>I'm sure the game is super unpolished and there are probably some bugs I didn't get to fix, but it should be playable. I hope you'll spend some fun and comfy times here in Square Town.</p>\r\nNote: This game features waving. Villagers will wave at each other every now and then\r\nedit: v1.1 fixes a bug with the fields preventing the player to build something else over them\u00a0edit:\u00a0v1.2\u00a0<ul><li>fixed a bug where a map tile became unusable after destroying a building</li><li>fixed a bug where villagers would get stuck in their harvesting animation if the resource they were looking for gets destroyed while they're going to it</li><li>a few minor fixes and tweaks</li></ul>Thank you so much for the incredible support. I never expected for this tiny little game to have so much following and love.\u00a0Thank you all for playing it, even in its bug-ridden state.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02fac08c79f00558d54c287a0eb2a91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
