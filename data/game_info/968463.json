{"id": 968463, "slug": "the-kindeman-remedy", "name": "The Kindeman Remedy", "name_original": "The Kindeman Remedy", "description": "Doctor Carl Kindeman has lost everything. Scorned and hated by the entire medical community for his \u201cquestionable\u201d methods, he accepted a miserable job in an appalling prison. <br/><br/>But that is all part of the plan. Here, he will restore his lost reputation. Here, no one will notice his experiments.<h3>Be the Monster</h3>Doctor Kindeman would do anything to restore his reputation. <strong>Anything</strong>.<br/><br/>Do with the inmates as you please. Let them die screaming on the electric chair, or save them...only to use them for your research afterward. Melt their bones, burn their intestines, or simply maul them to death: you are a genius, and they are just your guinea pigs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It feels good to be bad...but do you have the stomach for it?<h3>Physician, manage Thy Lab</h3>Being an evil doctor is hard work: <strong>upgrade </strong>and use eight different rooms, <strong>manage </strong>your resources, play with poisons, drugs, and hazardous substances, and conduct secret experiments. <br/><br/>It is a lot to handle, but you are not alone. <strong>Sister Anna</strong> is there for you. Always. And always ready to do just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/><h3>A Story-Driven Madness with Multiple Endings</h3>A dark story populated with complex characters adds depth to this gut-wrenching experience, raising disturbing moral questions and showing us the other side of evil: humanity. <br/><br/><strong>Multiple endings</strong> and <strong>unlockable events</strong> make the game replayable, leaving the destiny of Anna and Carl in the player\u2019s hands. Whether they fail or triumph is up to you.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-18T22:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c17c83a1eb08d8b065d36d484eac3db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Troglobytes Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["3D Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
