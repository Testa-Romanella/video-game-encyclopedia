Go down to the pub and play the hot new card game where you also race starships. Just try not to spend too much money on card packs (after all, the only thing stopping you is your own self-restraint).</p>\n<p><strong>Playing the game:</strong></p>\n<p>When you start a race you will need to make a deck from the cards you own. Click on a card to move it in/out of your deck. A deck consists of 1 ship card and 6 standard cards.</p>\n<p>During the race, use the movement controls (A/D or arrow keys) to avoid incoming asteroids (hitting them will give you a time penalty).</p>\n<p>At certain intervals, the race will pause and an \u201cevent\u201d will occur - this is where you play your cards. You need to match the difficulty level of the event card with your ship\u2019s relevant stat, or you take a time penalty. Choose a card to play - this card will add to your ship\u2019s stats for this event.</p>\n<p>At the end of the race, your time is compared to your opponent\u2019s - the lowest time wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab62cb27eb037f553d494bbc5b38da1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cheesey Bob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
