You have 5 minutes before things start getting toasty. Keep an eye on your battery meter, if it gets too low, you'll need to find a recharge socket. There are many data keys to collect around the ship which adds to your score as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music by Sergey Tosov</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c9f6a8cef501df34af59e766597da50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prefim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
