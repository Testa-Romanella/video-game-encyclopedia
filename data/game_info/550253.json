Recover your connections with your old school friend, workmate and a recent stranger you met through your hobby by using your (social distanced) interactions represented as cards. Send memes to their faces as a Geeky Mage, recommend the latest teas as a Druid Hipster or got all-out as the Athletic Berserker. As you recover your connections, you can buy more cards to be able to interact in new ways. To max out their relationships, you'll need to use powerful ultimate cards.</p>\n<p>You may have felt that you've lost their connections with them, but you may find out, that that was never true at all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T05:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f860b86397553f941dfb605c11f5d99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Torana", "DigitalDice"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
