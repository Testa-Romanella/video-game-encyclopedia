Avoid obstacles along the way and deliver as much mail as possible to earn a high score. Use Left- and Right-arrow keys to move side to side, Up to roll and Spacebar to jump and flutter in the air, and lastly Down to slow Pigeon man down. Pressing ESC will close out the game and pressing R will restart. WASD keys are another way to move Pigeon-Man, and fluttering (double jumping) in the air is limited to three times.</p>\n\n<p>Made in Unity with a team of talented people during the 2018 Global Game Jam.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/unstoppable-shipment-pigeon-service<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a60cbd4557b07d37a0091e985e1bf1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Austin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
