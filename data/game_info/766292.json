I added every currently recognized planet in our solar system and scaled them appropriately using a 1/1 ratio of earth. For example, Earth's scale is 1,1,1. Jupiter has a diameter of 11.19 Earths, so the scale used for Jupiter is 11.19,11.19,11.19. I did this for every planet, including the Sun but at a 1/4th scale because a full-size replication of the Sun would be too much. I\u00a0added 53 moons to Jupiter for fun, in honor of the 53 named moons Jupiter currently has.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Created by Keean Snediker</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:18:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c21e2617bdc0391d591b465b95b3940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["keeansnediker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
