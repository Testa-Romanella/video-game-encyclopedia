For their next planned outing, the club has agreed to kayak a newly discovered river that runs through the mountains and forests of Finland. Helping locals by charting it as they go. You are rather wary of the cold but put on a brave face and vote in favor of it. The river has been noted as being rather strange. Compasses don\u2019t work around it and stars seem oddly dim in the night sky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf91b9d2c8dccb8a2ccbd26dc224dde1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MasterReeses"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
