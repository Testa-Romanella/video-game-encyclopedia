{"id": 779865, "slug": "cat-powered-ufo", "name": "Cat Powered UFO", "name_original": "Cat Powered UFO", "description": "Cat Powered UFO is a comedy RPG inspired by the old-school Super Nintendo game Earthbound.<br/><br/>The design philosophy was to combine the best parts out of old school games like Zelda-style puzzles and overworld battles, as well as turn-based combat, and leave out the grinding and other boring bits!<br/><br/>Much like Mario Odyssey, Cat Powered UFO allows you to move on to new areas and challenges without finishing absolutely everything possible in your current area.<br/><br/>Battles revolve around minigames, which are unique to each enemy.<br/>Combat is easy to learn, but offers surprising depth to players who wish to find synergies of \"Illegal bonuses\".<br/>You can combine these \"Illegal bonuses\" to break the combat system!<br/>And essentially customize your battle experience to your liking.<br/>There is even a \"HARDCORE MODE\" for the player who likes their games to kick them in the scrotum.<br/><br/>The whole game is designed to be a short and sweet experience, taking players somewhere between 3-5 hours to reach the standard ending.<br/>However, there is also a \"True ending\" for those that want to go above and beyond!<br/><br/>I recommend using an Xbox controller for the best experience.  However, a keyboard also works perfectly well.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a whacky and light-hearted experience to fill your day, I humbly suggest you give Cat Powered UFO a try!<br/>And with that, I leave you with a poem.<br/><br/>A poem, for you!  My potential player!<br/><br/>Be yourself!  As you always are!<br/>My next request, is a bit out far!<br/>You're an alien! <br/>AN ALIEN?<br/><br/>You even have an Alien Wife!<br/>Livin' that sweet Alien Life!<br/>What more could you want?<br/>Ok, let's say shes pregnant!<br/><br/>But no good thing can last for long!<br/>THE SPACE DEVIL has come along!<br/>He kidnaps your wife!<br/>Causing you strife!<br/>And so your adventure begins...<br/><br/>Your means of travel, powered by cats!<br/>You look around, and how about that!<br/>There isn't a cat to be seen or heard!<br/>The solution, you know to be absurd...<br/><br/>To venture into a world you hate!<br/>Full of mischief, I'll tell you mate!<br/>This place is crazy!<br/>Lost their minds!<br/>No doubt you'll do the same in kind!<br/><br/>Strap yourself in!<br/>Let us begin!<br/>Embrace the madness thats within!<br/>You'll laugh, you'll cry. <br/>You'll probably die!<br/>And yeet your keyboard to the sky!<br/><br/>But won't regret a dollar spent!<br/>Cat Powered UFO!<br/>Worth every cent!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T06:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7af9fd1c0b41cb1a21cc2666433d5cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squashed Newt"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Squashed Newt"], "esrb_rating": null}
