It is better optimized for a mobile experience. Scroll down to the bottom of the description to find the download button.</strong><br/></p>\r\nGame info:\r\n<p>Consider this game as a modern day reimagining of the Retro hit - <strong>Charlie Charlie</strong>.</p>\n<p>The original Circus charlie has 5 levels, each with its own unique game mechanic. I always imagined what the game would be like if all of those game elements could coexist simultaneously in the same level. This game is an attempt to realize that vision.</p>\n<p>This game has <strong>5 levels</strong>. Each level offers you variety of obstacles. The levels are not very difficult, and have 5 checkpoints. You can skip a level if you feel it to be impossibly difficult. If you do so, definitely leave feedback on which part was difficult.</p>\n<p>Also, if you want to skip over the game, <strong>please try out level 5</strong>. It is the heart of the game.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Arrow keys/ A-D</strong> === movement<br/><strong>Up arrow/ W</strong>\u00a0=== jump</p>\r\nDifficulty Settings:\r\nTWO BUTTONS:\r\n<p>The back button is disabled making it impossible for you to move backwards in a level.<br/><em>Difficult</em><br/></p>\r\nYOU ONLY LIVE ONCE:\r\n<p>The checkpoints are disabled. You'll have to start over the level from the beginning if you die.<br/><em>Very Difficult</em><br/></p>\r\nRAGE QUIT MY ASS:\r\n<p>The Movement keys are disabled. You automatically move forward and are in control of only the jump key.<br/><em>Warning: Extremely Difficult</em></p>\r\nFUCK THE GOD!\r\n<p>All the above three, at once!<br/>How to beat?<br/>1. Take a deep breath.<br/>2. Start the level.<br/>3. Hold your breath till you complete the level.<br/><em>Warning: Impossibly Difficult</em></p>\r\nJam specific details:\r\nRequirement:\r\n<p><strong>Boss</strong>: Play level 5.</p>\r\nTheme:\r\n<p><strong>On The Edge</strong>: The levels are designed to keep you on the edge, especially the new mechanic in the last level. It will drastically change your gameplay style.</p>\r\nDiversifiers:\r\nColour Blind Friendly:\r\n<p>In the options menu, two options <strong>Colour blind Mode</strong>\u00a0and <strong>High Contrast Mode</strong>\u00a0are available. Select whichever suits you.</p>\n<p>This is not tested and I'm not sure how affective it is. I went off the sources from internet. I naturally designed the game to have enough contrast to identify the difference between different level elements. If anyone is interested to add any inputs with regards to colour blind support, please feel comfortable to do so in the comments.</p>\r\nDoing you part:\r\n<p>I uploaded pixel art animations of the fire shaders you see in the game to\u00a0<strong>OpenGameArt.org</strong>. Check credits section for more info.</p>\r\nInfinity:\r\n<p>I'm planning to implement an infinite level that procedurally generates the level elements.</p>\r\nMobile:\r\n<p>The browser game is still playable in mobile. You'll have to enable the <strong>on screen buttons</strong>\u00a0in the\u00a0<strong>options</strong>\u00a0menu.</p>\n<p>Else, an .apk build, that is better\u00a0optimized for a mobile experience, is available for download.</p>\r\nMusic generation:\r\n<p>The game contains no music, only Sound Effects.</p>\r\nMy own noise:\r\n<p>All the Sound Effects are recorded at home, and manipulated using Audacity.</p>\r\nOld music:\r\n<p>Although any\u00a0music is absent, the song\u00a0<strong>The Lion Sleeps Tonight(1961)</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>The Tokens</strong> is used as a soft theme throughout the game.</p>\r\nQuick Run:\r\n<p>Each level takes around a minute to complete. And the game can be completed within 5 minutes. Try speed running the game in different modes.</p>\r\nRetro palette:\r\n<p>The game uses a restricted colour palette. I'll upload the colour palette later.</p>\r\nToolmaker:\r\n<p>Planned for future.</p>\n<p>This will enable creative players to turn into game designers and create new levels in a drag and drop style editor.</p>\r\nTwo Button:\r\n<p>Enable\u00a0<strong>Two Button\u00a0</strong>in the\u00a0<strong>Difficulty Settings</strong>\u00a0to play the game with only two buttons.</p>\r\nOne Button:\r\n<p>Enable\u00a0<strong>Rage Quit</strong>\u00a0in the\u00a0<strong>Difficulty Settings\u00a0</strong>to play the game with only jump input.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><em>created by\u00a0<strong>RK</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>socials:</strong><br/></em>Twitter\u00a0-\u00a0<em>@i_rk_jain<br/></em>Insta\u00a0-\u00a0<em>@i_rk_jain</em></p>\n<p>Made using\u00a0<strong><em>Godot Game Engine</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Product and Testing</em></strong> - Kavya Sree</p>\n<p><em><strong>Art done by self.</strong></em><br/>Pixel Art Animations of Fire Shaders in the game are available at<br/>FireBall (64x64, 128x128, 192x192) -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/fireball-4<br/>Fire (Adjustable length - Tilemap ish) - https://opengameart.org/content/fire-9</p>\n<p><strong><em>Art borrowed.<br/></em></strong>Dragon -\u00a0Sirce-AP -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/chinese-dragon<br/>utilized after minor colour corrections.<br/>Fountain -\u00a0rubberduck -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/animated-fountain-isometric<br/>utilized after minor colour corrections.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sounds recorded by self.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c7fe180ff871d04d5682bf4a9fb316f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["RK Jain"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
