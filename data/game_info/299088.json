Those creepy little creatures, who are making life hard for your beloved doggo's. Wouldn't it be amazing to join\u00a0in a gigantic (tiny)\u00a0battle against flea's, and exterminate them ALL? Yeah, I thought so. In this tower defense\u00a0game you can do that! Fight your battles on the small planets of the fleas, the doggo's, and lead them to victory.\u00a0Use spray towers and soap cannons, because... why not? (and lasers of course... we're in space, what else did you expect?)</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programmer: Mark Porter<br/>https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ixZ6UT0IW1Bnx-w_N1qWAn_6hPlftvBL</p>\n<p>Music And Sound Effects: Yavuz Selim Yorulmaz ( a.k.a.
