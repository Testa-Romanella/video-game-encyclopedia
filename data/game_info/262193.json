{"id": 262193, "slug": "imagine-cavern", "name": "Imagine Cavern", "name_original": "Imagine Cavern", "description": "<p>The full game is here. There is one bug that I was unable to fix. It is when you first encounter the man in the cavern and he asks if you want anything from him. You have to say no otherwise it crashes.</p>\n<p>The focus of this game is to allow players to use their imagination while playing a game. Video games today always have fancy graphics and don't challenge you at all. If you play this game it will challenge you to grow your imaginative capabilities while playing a fun adventure. It does not have to be realistic and that's good because you will have to imagine stuff that would never happen for real but solely in your mind.</p>\n<p>In imagine Cavern you play as yourself on a journey to find your friend in a deep cavern that has mysterious things lurking in the shadows. Visit the creepy underground merchants that are questionably human. Immerse yourself in the music of the cavern as you play through the story. Go through intense battles with crazy magical powers and abilities. All packed into a great story line of finding your friend in the deepest depths of the earth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81a63de6db792d3d4362ca65ee6bc55b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RollPoll123"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
