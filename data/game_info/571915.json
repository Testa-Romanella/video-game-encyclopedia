Adam,s [sic] speed chalenge[sic], in all its original glory.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, up + side movement to jump.\u00a0Beat levels in 30 seconds or die. If you die for any reason, including the previously-mentioned invisible time limit, the game closes, so you'll need to open it again. Some things that look like walls are actually ladders with janky hitboxes. There's other uh, \"fun surprises\"\u00a0in this game like that too.</p>\n<p>This hasn't been recompiled in modern CF2.5, but rather is the original EXE compiled in whatever version of TGF2 I was using at the time,\u00a0for the sake of keeping any and all original bugs in-tact.</p>\n<p>The cover is literally just a screenshot from the game because the game doesn't have a title screen... so I also added comic sans to it. Because believe me, it fits.</p>\n<p>FUN FACT: TGF2 games should be able to work in versions of Windows as far back as Windows 95. Feel free to give that a whirl, if you'd like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/41589015da598206128fee74b25fd186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Happy Frog Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
