We have already observed that the players tend to throw the ball in a parable. Instead throw it like a bowling ball, at the lowest point of your throw arc. It will improve the speed.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Aiming </strong>in VR: We have already noticed that putting the same leg as the throwing arm before you improves accuracy. If you step forward with that let\u00a0at the moment of throwing the ball also tends to improve the result of accuracy and speed.</p>\n<p>- Everyone is different!
