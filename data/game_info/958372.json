Luckily for you, you just need to find\r\nher basket in someone's backyard and then using the given map and the special head torch you have to find the\r\nlocations where to hide these eggs (they will be marked with a red |X|) before the morning comes (indicated by\r\nthe timer at the top of the screen). The objective, i.e., what you have to find, will be seen in the top left\r\ncorner of the window. You have to hide as many eggs as there are eggs in the basket. Good luck!\r\n  \r\nMusic credits \r\nMusic generated using cgMusic: http://maciej.codeminion.com/2008/05/cgmusic-computers-create-music/ \r\nfrom: https://www.fakemusicgenerator.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T17:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/2944ab81113c39fc6be06249c2efc900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matiiss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
