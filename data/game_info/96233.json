{"id": 96233, "slug": "hells-gate-a-wasteland-kings-mod", "name": "Hells Gate - A Wasteland Kings Mod", "name_original": "Hells Gate - A Wasteland Kings Mod", "description": "<p>This is a small little mod made by one dude, me, for the original Mojam game-jam back in 2013. Because of the primitive base this mod is jumping up from it will seem a little basic but I promise in time this will become something new in of its own.</p><p>Currently the game has a few new features from the Wasteland Kings prototype. Including a replacement for the 3 old areas (Desert,Sewers and Scrapyard) called Labs, Old Labs, Purgatory and the Boneyard which have some new enemies in them. We also have 7 new mutations which feature all new icons/art for you to enjoy. There's also a host of new weapons with 3 new kinds of shot called Bouncer (re-added to the game) , Nail (low damage high peircing shots) and thin melle which is found in the eleusive Power Hatchet weapon. Not only that but there's a new ammo type known as Hellfire which has charging shots that create an enemy-damaging expolsion upon contact.</p><p>There's also the main change in the game, the new characters. As of Update 6 there are no original characters found within Nuclear throne with 6 new characters added to the roster. There characters are Commando (who receives more ammo and can dash), Crawler (who's both fast and able to teleport), Dammed (a weaker character who does more damage and can shoot a massively powerful shot) and well as Cultist (Who can eat corpses for a chance at an item and has levels spawn earlier), Freak (who creates gas) and Flesh (who has more health/health drops and can create enemy-blocking walls).</p><p>Obviously due to the primitive nature of both the mod and the build of Nuclear Throne it was based on bugs will occur. So if you encounter a bug either post on one of the reddit threads found on either /r/NuclearThrone or /r/ntmods or notify me in the itch.io comment thread. While I do try to release weekly my limited skils will mean that weekly updates are something I can't promise. We also have a Discord, where the invite can be found at https://www.reddit.com/r/ntmods/comments/4u133k/he....</p><p>Can you reach the gates of hell?
