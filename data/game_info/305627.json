These are the cards that are in your hand that you can use to fill in the blanks in the black cards. No one else can see your white cards until you play them. <br/><br/>Game phase<br/><br/>You will also see one black card. This card contains a sentence you will need to fill with one (or more where requested) white card in your hand. Try to pick the card that makes the sentence in the black card most funny, satirical, ironical, or whatever you stupid kids are into these days.  Btw, the white card you just used will be immediately replaced with a white card drawn from the deck, so you will always have white 10 cards.<br/><br/>Judgement phase<br/><br/>Now the best part of the game happens: the judge will need to pick the winning white card from the list of shuffled and anonymised replies that every player gave. Once the judge chooses a white card the player who played it gets one point and becomes the judge for the next round.<br/><br/>It\u2019s so easy that maybe even you can play this game. Or well.. maybe not.<br/><br/>Note: to play this game at least one player should be a Game Host.
