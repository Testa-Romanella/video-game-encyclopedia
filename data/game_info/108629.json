Most people can do that\r\n\t\tquite well within weeks. <br/><br/> \r\n\t\t\r\n\tWhat has taken many YEARS for most musicians, is intuitively pouring out their musical thoughts, \r\n\t\tand getting them flowing out of their fingers and into their instrument.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYour time in this game can help you gain skills for this improvisational style of playing.\r\n\tThe muscle memory, the feel of the note intervals, the spatial relationships &amp; scales.<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nFeatures:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n* More intuitive &amp; comfortable than other games' Pro Modes<br/>\r\n* None of your game time is simply throwaway entertainment<br/>\r\n* You can play a song instantly, by sight.  No looping/studying/memorizing necessary.  <br/>\r\n* You can control exactly how fast or slow the song goes in fine degrees.<br/>\r\n* Mistakes sound like REAL mistakes.  Out of tune and/or out of time.<br/>\r\n* Jump in late on a note, &amp; still get partial score.  It's a satisfying feeling being able to correct \r\n\t\t\tyour mistakes.<br/>\r\n* You can play a harmony or play independently of the song.  Like a real instrument.<br/>\r\n* Improvise extra notes, runs, trills, etc. in between your on-screen notes (without losing score).<br/>\r\n* Allows spontaneous \"fingerpicking\"/arpeggiating of chords, &amp; adding rhythmic variations.  Express yourself.<br/>\r\n  * You can even play a REAL instrument (without being scored) with the help of the game's visuals<br/>\r\n  * All this without being a lot harder than 5 \"note\" pure entertainment games<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac3a171c2f0f99a2653b2d6d8c7b2dbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["corpusc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
