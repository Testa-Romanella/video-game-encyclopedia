They had the genius idea to develop a remote control in order to speed up getting all the cars from A to B. But somehow, this idea worked much better in their mind than in reality....</p>\n<p>Move all cars to a free elevator (W, A, S, D). But beware, there are new cars coming every now and then! Also, the frequency selection does not quite work yet, so <strong>all</strong> active cars are controlled at the same time. And on top of that, the frequency switches sometimes (so your active cars change). But that shouldn't be a problem for <strong>you</strong>, right?</p>\n<p>Oh, and the parking garage isn't the newest anymore, so please <strong>be careful</strong> with the supporting pillars.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:42:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e21590beb11c9f8e956eec7fdeeb60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lennovative", "Camaika", "saveng0r", "Felan", "Sushman", "Aaron Kirchwehm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
