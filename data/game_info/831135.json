You will soon see a world where such </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>peaceful place will be everywhere.\r\n<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>~~~~~<br/></em></p>\n<p>It was all written in the book of Creation. <em>Laksen Erfus.</em> That was the name of the Creator. The old people told every children of his might. A might that only a great wizard is capable of! Old folks also mentioned about his undying hope to preserve the world and deliver us to life. The very thing that we have now. It was all thanks to him.</p>\n<p>But... none of the book ever mentioned how exactly did Laksen created Lakserf. What was his life before being the Creator? What was the world like back then?</p>\n\n<p>~~~~~</p>\n<p>Lakserf: The Creation is a short story-driven adventure rpg intended to be a side story and introduction to a game I'm currently developing. Although mechanics were heavily modified in this to follow certain criteria, the battle system done to this game is somewhat identical with the main game.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Turn-based battle system heavily relying on strategy</li><li>No resources/items. Certain mechanics are introduced to make up for it.</li><li>Limited yet unique character skill sets.</li><li>Energy system.</li></ul>\n<p>All of this are just the result of my ideas. Hope you enjoy the game!</p>\n<p><em>*Note:\u00a0 This game currently requires keyboards with arrow keys for a specific mechanic.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>TRIGGER WARNING:</em><em> Contains flashing lights</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T14:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f2c7ec4ab0218831416c27ba2e29a4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EGStryker"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
