What if there was <strong>fire</strong> in the middle? What if the whole field was <strong>frozen</strong> and there were skaters knocking the ball? What if there was a <strong>snake</strong>? A <strong>cannon</strong>? <strong>Ghosts</strong>? <strong>Bats</strong>? <strong>Wind</strong>? <strong>Water</strong>? <strong>Portals</strong>? This is the kind of ideas that inspired me in creating <strong>Project:Pong</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Project:Pong offers many hours of fun gameplay with lots of levels and a competitive local multiplayer.

I'm constantly uploading new videos!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the <strong>Master mode</strong> you will face the Master, and beating him is the most difficult quest in the game. In this game mode the ball moves at an extremely high speed, but the Master is able to predict where the ball will go almost every time! The best I managed to do was to score 5 points and then lose miserably....<br/>Who will be the first to defeat the Master?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheat code to instantly unlock all gamemodes, skins and levels:<br/>In the main menu press F8 and then type 4321 in the keypad that will appear on screen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T09:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66ba4df0ba8854371dc7cccce2cdc1a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matteo D'Alessandro"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Matteo D'Alessandro"], "esrb_rating": null}
