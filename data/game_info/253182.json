As they lament their situation, something unexpected happens... Can you guide them to their freedom?</p>\n<p>This game was an entry for the RPG Codex 5-day RPG Maker Contest. Navigate your way through the ruins, using your spells to explore the dungeon and avoid deadly monsters. Exploration is turn-based like in roguelikes - the monsters only move when you move, so take your time to plan your route.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- Arrow keys - move in four directions and navigate menus</p>\n<p>- Z, Enter or Space - interact with the environment and confirm options in menus</p>\n<p>- X or Esc - open or exit the menu<br/></p>\n<p>- Alt+Enter - toggle full-screen / windowed mode</p>\n<p>A gamepad should also work, but I haven't tested it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay tips:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- You can save the game at any time outside battles. Use it to your advantage  to try out different approaches.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Experiment with your spells available via the\u00a0Skills menu.<br/></p>\n<p>- Your resources are limited. Conserve your mana or you might be forced to restart!<br/></p>\n<p>- You don't gain anything useful by killing monsters (besides clearing the way). Try to avoid unnecessary fights.<br/></p>\n<p>- There are two different endings.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- It is possible to sequence break and skip a part of  the game which results in some inconsistencies. It does not prevent you from finishing the game though.<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to use the game for any purpose, but please credit me when appropriate.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca034b426a21b041086e9a945d1206b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niekt\u00f3ry"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
