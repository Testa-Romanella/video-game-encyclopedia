It doesn't matter if your answer is correct if the audience disagrees. What a hard show, maybe there is a way to win? You could try to guess all the answers or maybe click on another tab? Be careful because you don't want to get caught, and the audience might change their answer if you keep checking! The show isn't over till you have answered all the questions whether you win or lose. Have fun and thanks for playing.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Audio:<br/></p>\n<p>EZduzziteh (https://opengameart.org/users/ezduzziteh | https://ezduzziteh.itch.io/)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"Well Done\" Copyright 2013 by Iwan Gabovitch <qubodup.net> multi-licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license <http: 3.0=\"\" by=\"\" creativecommons.org=\"\" legalcode=\"\" licenses=\"\"> and/or GPLv3+ <http: gpl.html=\"\" licenses=\"\" www.gnu.org=\"\"></http:></http:></qubodup.net>- qubodup (https://opengameart.org/users/qubodup | https://qubodup.github.io/)</p>\n<p>Fupi (https://opengameart.org/users/fupi|https://fupicat.github.io/)</p>\n<p>Listener (https://opengameart.org/users/listener | https://www.patreon.com/listener4u/creators | https://twitter.com/listener4me)</p>\n<p>sauer2 \"Anonymous\" (https://opengameart.org/content/oldschool-win-and-die-jump-and-run-sounds)</p>\n<p>Kenney (https://opengameart.org/users/kenney | https://www.kenney.nl/ | https://www.patreon.com/kenney)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08ad17e54fc8a9ed7abf1fc33a11e65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MelloBot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
