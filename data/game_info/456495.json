There is a .json file in the resources folder you can edit to add or change the cards if you don't feel like using the built in card creation system. There is no limit to how many cards you\u00a0 can add so go nuts! At the moment I only have regular and key cards working I am currently working on equipment and disaster cards (spells). Feel free to leave a comment about the game. Uses ASCII graphics for each card.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8ac6a7545b2ca07ab7ea15d2687b93a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trunks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
