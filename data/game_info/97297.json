You're invited to share any advice, thought or feeling in the comments!</p>\r\nPlot introduction\r\n<p><em>The protagonist has somehow lost his memory. He is part of an intriguing group of high schoolers that have a kink for investigating shady misteries.</em></p>\n<p><em>This idea has been inspired by Norman, \"Newsman\" for friends. He is their informal leader, and finds out tricky things every day. Their discoveries are usually minor scandals or illegitimate relationships among their friends. They also usually track down bike thieves, coward bullies and the like.</em></p>\n<p><em>The mystery involving the protagonist's loss of memory is, though, something that immediately keep everyone's breath still, as Norman finds out that he - or she - may be not the only one involved in this mysterious happening.</em></p>\r\nProject details\r\n<p>The project was developed during itch.io \"<em>My First Game Jam: Winter 2018</em>\".</p>\n<p>Its 1.0 (open beta) version was completed on 20/01/2018.</p><p>This project was thought to be completed in a short period of time. It was developed by RectorNero alone, to explore Ren'Py framework capabilities.</p><p>For this reason, it has plenty of room for improvement, it is a beta (prototype) version, as it was meant to be.</p><p>If you like the concept and would like to contribute, you're welcome.

Be sure to click on it, and not on the other parts of the\u00a0screen.
