The game doesn't have any win/lose conditions yet, but you can move around and do some stuff. Again, gotta reiterate, so so <em>sooo\u00a0</em>unfinished. Look forward to the... more finished version, hopefully by the end of the year.\u00a0 p.s. there's also an exe if you wanna download and play this, which honestly, thanks if you bother playing it at all, I appreciate it. p.p.s. those stairs to the 2nd floor are tricky, you might need to hop a bit.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c40e25dba9b148ef3ab19211efa4bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drella"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
