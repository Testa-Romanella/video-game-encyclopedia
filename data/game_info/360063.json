The Theme was \"Only One\", so at the start of every level, you have one bullet; and to earn more, you have to get Combo Kills. Did I Mention that you also only have one HP?</p>\n<p>As a Side Note, Time Slows down when you Jump. That's Pretty Cool, Isn't it?</p>\n<p>This is the Second Game Jam I've Ever Participated in, so go easy on the reviews, eh?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:27:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/64952a673853899a68eed822f53d423a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UltraSkull1000"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
