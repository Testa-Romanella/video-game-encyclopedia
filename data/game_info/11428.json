You run on a platform that falls apart and you need to stay alive as long as you can. The world around consists of cubes; you have a physics-based ability to return them to their place before everything is destroyed.</p>\n<p>The game is split into two modes. The Survival is classic: stay on the platform using your powers. The Dash mode adds to the concept a necessity to collect orbs on the same collapsing platform. All changes on the levels are random: there are no identical playthroughs. Every time you play Streamline, you face new challenges and ways to reach the goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:40:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/928/928515db0188ec1703eee284d19a4cc0.jpg", "website": "http://www.frostcloudstudios.com/", "rating": 1.74, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1560, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 26}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 49, "ratings_count": 81, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 81, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frostcloud Studios", "Watson Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frostcloud Studios", "Watson Ventures"], "esrb_rating": null}
