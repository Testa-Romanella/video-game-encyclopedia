Some messages contributed by Ada and Jesper van Heeswijck.</p>\n<p>To customise, edit the Tiles.xml file found in the Windows_Data\\StreamingAssets\\ folder. You can hot-reload the game at any time\u00a0by pressing CTRL-L .</p>\n<p>Tile specifications require the 'Tile' tag and the 'type' attribute, e.g.\u00a0<tile type=\"Grass\"></tile></p>\n<p>The game has a simple height mechanic - you can only travel up or down one level at a time, with levels increasing as follows: Water &lt; Grass &lt; Hill &lt; Mountain</p>\n<p>Tiles also need a 'Position' element with 'x' and 'y' attributes to place them in the desired row and column. I've used negative x values, but they can be positive too.</p>\n<p>You can specify the starting tile with the 'start=\"true\"' attribute (try to have only one of these!)</p>\n<p>Any tile can be given a text message with the 'Message' element. Tiles with no Message element will hide the message window.</p>\n<p>Sprites: www.kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Easy Lemon (30 second) Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\n</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/729/7294bf4be474635a02363cfb8cbe9133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Torbjorn van Heeswijck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
