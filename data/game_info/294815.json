(In this case, the level could indicate the strength of your plane, or how many pieces are still attached).\r\nOnce you go below level 8, bombs are disabled, and it just gets worse from there.\r\nTo level\u00a0<em>up</em>, and also to gain lost health, you must ram into floating wrenches, which are often clustered or inside blocks.\r\nLastly, there's a reward for leveling up past level 12: You get a top hat!</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\nUp/Down to move plane\r\nSpace to shoot\r\nB to bomb<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"The plane slowly falls down due to mysterious reasons.
