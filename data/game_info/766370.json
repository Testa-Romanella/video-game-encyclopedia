{"id": 766370, "slug": "the-saga-of-thorbjorn", "name": "The Saga of Thorbjorn", "name_original": "The Saga of Thorbjorn", "description": "<p>Welcome to the world, where there is nowhere to run\u2026 That is, until you build a path. You are Thorbjorn Olafsson, a Viking in pursuit of your sweetheart, Helga, who has been kidnapped by the fire giant Surtr. You must reach the Yggdrasil to finish the level.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple. You begin in the starting point. As soon as the level starts, Thorbjorn starts running. You must add the parts of the track to keep Thorbjorn running, until the finish line is reached. The choices are: a straight piece of track, a left turn, and a right turn. Use the following controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>A - adds a left turn\r\n</p>\n<p>W - adds a straight piece\r\n</p>\n<p>D - adds a right turn\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - jump\r\n</p>\n<p>You can only add five track pieces ahead. That means, once you step on a track piece, you can add another piece as long as there are zero, one, or two pieces after the current one. This is a lot to read, but once you play the game, this will be very obvious.\r\n</p>\n<p>There will be obstacles on the way, so you must build the track around them. There will also be obstacles on the track pieces; the pieces will be chosen randomly, and you won\u2019t get to choose if you will get a piece with or without obstacles, because that wouldn\u2019t be very fun now, would it? Anyway, you can jump over those. If Thorbjorn hits an obstacle, he dies. If he hits an existing track, he dies. If he hits an obstacle on the track, believe it or not, he dies.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/1597c0678fe54c4e91e367f4a4074588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kr0s"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
