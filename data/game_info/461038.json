You need to run around a maze-like island, kill bad guys, find secrets and save kids before time runs out. Kids will give you +1 damage or +0.1 to speed multiplier.<br/><br/>Your goal is to complete the level very fast or get most amount of points (you'll get most points if you kill all enemies, find all secrets, save all kids and do it very fast, so you need to find the fastest way around the island). You can see my own records in screenshots section.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, so there is only 1 level now, but i am already working on a second one.<br/>You can always find old builds on my github\u00a0here, if you're interested (but releases are in russian).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a4bbfb553b8f3a7521092f46e8174f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["soslowman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
