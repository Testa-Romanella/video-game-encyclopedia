She has recruited a unique foursome of watertight buddies - The Buddy\u00a0Squad - to fix that for her. By taking over the world for Blighty.</p>\n<p>Daniel Johnston is the Welsh-ish eco-warrior with a thirst for violence - renewable violence. Mark\u00a0Alexander is the Spanish\u00a0Scot whose number one priority is to look cool in victory. Allison James is English, scared of loud noises, but is happy to wage war if it means she ends up with a bigger home. And the Irishman Darrell Flood? He just wants to watch the world burn.</p>\n<p>Command the Buddy Squad's four armies around a map of the world blitzing capital cities, weakening or recruiting enemies, building British towns everywhere they go, and keeping a steady flow of troops in their midst as they conquer every square.</p>\n<p>Britskrieg mixes strategy with idle game, and a sprinkling of education - every sovereign state that's a member of the UN in its own right (thank you Richard Osman) is represented, as well as their capitals with rough locations and their 2018 populations. And there's also\u00a0a little bit of patriotism. But only a little bit. Because British patriotism is British pessimism.</p>\n<p>Contains no Brexit humour. Breathe a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Created for the GMC Jam 32.</p>\n<p>Game programming, design, art and music: Allison\u00a0James (half of Chequered Ink)<br/>Sound effects: Universal SFX<br/>World data: Wikipedia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:02:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16d23b35b08596d4506728f7b27fc652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
