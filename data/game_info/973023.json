Where did it all go wrong? <br/><br/>He sighs into the crowd, then to no one in particular\u2014 <br/><br/>\u201c...I sure could use a little kindness right about now.\u201d <br/><br/>But in that moment, feet away, Mami Mamiya is searching, too. This shy she-demon is on the hunt for a human connection, and so Koichi\u2019s story takes a supernatural turn... <br/><br/>Tempted by fate and an unsolicited invite from Mami, he hitches a car ride to her remote mountain abode. Little does he know he might never return. Or will he...? <br/><br/>Koichi is soon shocked to learn he\u2019s in no ordinary village, but a succubine sanctuary, hidden from human eyes! <br/><br/>After years of self-exile and isolation, a son of Adam is just what this hamlet needs to reacquaint itself with the outside world. Demon contact, however, can prove lethal to the average joe... <br/><br/>Not our Koichi, though. This guy\u2019s built different.<h3>MAIN HEROINE </h3><br/><strong>Mami Mamiya</strong><br/>Voice: Yuki Kitaohji <br/><br/>Mild and meek with a jealous streak. <br/><br/>For all her shyness, Mami\u2019s powers are almost second to none. At first, she wasn\u2019t too sold on the idea of befriending mortals, but for Koichi, she\u2019s willing to make an exception. In truth, the two have met once before\u2014at a summer festival years ago\u2014and she\u2019s been hoping to reunite ever since... <br/><br/>\u201cApparently, part of the plan was that I\u2019d get to meet my father. If that was even possible... Guess I\u2019ll never know.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T05:28:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ad/8adc4a1e12f92eb9556cd36cc7b385a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 503, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MOONSTONE", "Argonauts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
