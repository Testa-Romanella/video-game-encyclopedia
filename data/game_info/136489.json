The player movement is controlled by the visor rotation, and has controls configured to switch between jumping and interacting dynamically by providing any input in the form of a press/tap/click of any button.</p>\n<p>The Way of Life is, somewhat, inspired by the real life wherein people transform their perspective to better see the solutions to the problems. In the game, the player can change the environment to City, Grasslands, Desert or Sea and they consume &amp; provide certain resources. It is up to the player to balance it all out and achieve the highest score in an endless addictive &amp; fun game.</p>\n<p>(Note: I tested this game on a low-end android device resulting in severe lag and low FPS. For a better experience, high-end android phones are recommended)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a03e755bb948c30ae9c1682352a1d29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["aachman98"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
