Carefully decide what you will and won't need, and shoot for the fastest times you can.</p>\n<p>Use of a controller is highly recommended! The game works natively with both Dual-shock 4 and X-input controllers.</p><p>NOTE: There's some missing collision in the penultimate level of the game, but it's still fully beatable. Sorry about that mishap. I hope you still have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Programming and Design - @ZazSaysStuff</p>\n<p>Art and Design - @wendyisurfrendy</p>\n<p>Level Design and Moral Support - @Drooling_Demon</p>\n<p>Music by Abstraction:\u00a0http://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f07573a134b698a0acfe27029005998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zaz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
