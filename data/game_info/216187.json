You must learn what different\u00a0sounds mean to progress.\u00a0It is styled similarly to a roguelike\u00a0in that movement is\u00a0turn-based, but the levels are\u00a0static like an adventure game, and it ends up being more of a puzzle game in the end.</p>\n<p>Making the game playable for\u00a0blind people had the effect of making it unplayable by deaf people. Funny how that works. I could always\u00a0make a deaf-friendly version in the future.</p>\n<p>Be sure to read the readme file in the folder for the controls or you won't know how to go past the \"title screen.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/2876d97c4c6e3119a61052b8d25a9806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OrangeAdam"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
