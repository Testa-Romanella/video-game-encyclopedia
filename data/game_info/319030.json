{"id": 319030, "slug": "holm", "name": "holm", "name_original": "holm", "description": "<p>This is an abandoned prototype, originally meant to be a wander game about traversal, providing a huge environment to explore at a very leisurely pace.</p>\n<p>I was hoping to experiment with landscape design, creating a variety of small microbiomes and subtle gradations of place. Oddly enough, the inspiration for this was the 2006 adaptation of <em>The Wicker Man</em>, which, if nothing else, had a number of compelling settings.</p>\n<p>The idea was that you would start at one tip of the crescent-shaped island, and across the bay on the other tip would be your ultimate goal, a large manor of some kind. Taking the long way around, you would visit various other settlements and construct a history of successive lived generations in this place. Arriving at the manor you'd find... who knows, ghosts, probably.</p>\n<p>The main mechanic I was interested in, besides wandering, was the folding of space at certain points on the map. Playing it now, you start just down the hill from a tall tower. Approaching it, you're teleported to the top (I'd put a loading screen here, or ghosts, or something). From that vantage point, you can see a few other towers on the horizon. Initially, there'd be nothing to do besides observe the other towers; by the end they would serve as a means of instant point-to-point travel, effectively collapsing the space that had previously taken you a very long time to traverse.</p>\n<p>On indefinite hiatus for reasons of scope. You should try Eastshade, though.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WADS to walk around, mouse to look.</p>\n<p>Controls begin inverted, as nature intended, but you can hit I to flip them this way and that.</p>\n<p>If your crosshair touches one of three towers, it will be highlighted; left-click to warp to that point.</p>\n<p><strong>CODE<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The project, such as it is, is available on GitHub.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Drink pairing: Riesling<br/>\r\nMusic pairing: High Aura'd, No River Long Enough Doesn't Contain a Bend.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8f27b34ff3fb9f50b6bf07db8d90ebb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nicknicknicknick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
