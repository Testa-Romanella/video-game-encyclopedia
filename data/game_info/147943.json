I decided to make a Bully/ Enviro-Bear crossover in First Person! So I thought that it would be fun to have the player play as a guy or girl going through an arcade beating the sh%$ out of kids (Capsule shaped things (So far)) and robbing their drinks and food AND taking their go at the arcade from them! The aim of the game is to have as much food, drinks and fun as possible FOR FREE! </p><p>I have 3 UI bars that fill when\u2026 you've guessed it... eat, drink and click on the working arcade machines (for fun). </p><p>Eventually I hope to have models for the kids and actual playable arcade games but for now there is this\u2026 </p><p>Tell me what you think in the comments!</p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe post an idea or a direction you'd like to see me take the game? :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/43077fb259d681b471e86a5e3946bb46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Richard Fahy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
