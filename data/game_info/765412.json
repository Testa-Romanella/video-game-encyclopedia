This is our attempt to make the new Lyra Multiplayer 3rd Person game available on Mobile\u00a0 and PC. We are starting with the PC port, so we can learn from braking down the project, all the new ways in which we can develop our games in UE5. Android version to follow.<br/><br/>We are not going to change very much, as we want to get all working from default project by design. Moving forward, we will push it further and add more gameplay, story mode and levels,\u00a0along with \u00a0a master server to allow all players to find each others sessions without the need of a service like Steam, and a dedicated server to host games away from the LAN.<br/><br/>This project will be on going way into the future. We will update frequently with release information.\u00a0Feel free to play and let us know your thoughts :)<br/><br/>Enjoy and have fun.....\u00a0<br/><br/>Project Download:https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/learn/lyra</p>\n<p>UE5 Doc Resource :\u00a0https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/<br/><br/></p><p>v0.0.01 Alpha - 1st build test.
