This may still happen, but it's more likely I'll just end up making a different game and updating this one much later. If that happens, I'll try to have a more polished post-jam version uploaded here eventually, so stay tuned for that if you find yourself in need of some more sophisticated bone-rattling.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for playing and all that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T14:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb3e9cbabf11fc5f8d4062bb5e4c3d80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Dr. Pudding"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
