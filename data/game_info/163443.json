In the game you have a set number of lives and each time you die you loose one. You can get more lives by picking up the green power up which occasionally drops from enemies. There are also full-heal (Blue) and weapon (Red)\u00a0power ups which you might find while you play.</p><p>Dev Note:</p><p>I have been holding onto this game for sometime and only recently realized I have had a work in progress page for it recently.
