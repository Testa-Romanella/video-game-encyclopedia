Your wife has been kidnaped and YOU have to save her. Therefore you must climb a tower. In the tower, you have to get through a maze and for each floor, you only have 7 moves, so be careful and think before you move. The game was made within 96 hours in the Legacy Mob Beginner Game Jam #7. It was made by 2 junior devs from Germany and it was our first game ever finished. We hope you enjoy our indie game :D</p>\n\n<p>Sound:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx5HXT7xSj0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Scott_Holmes/cinematic-background-music/missi...</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asset:\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d8d4bdc44bf79dddb43cf3013f3c71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ality", "Mynato"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
