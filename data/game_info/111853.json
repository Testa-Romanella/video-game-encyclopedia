{"id": 111853, "slug": "evil-never-dies", "name": "Evil Never Dies", "name_original": "Evil Never Dies", "description": "<p>Evil Never Dies (E.N.D) needs your help. Our game is built upon inspiration from Evil Dead as an\u00a0enemy wave horror-like\u00a0shooter. Upon entering the cabin, you unleash a terrible evil that will stop at nothing until you are dead.\u00a0</p><p>Your character will be armed with a gun but, legend leads you to believe there may be something useful laying around just waiting to be discovered to help you stay alive.<br/></p><p>\u00a0But, truthfully, how long will you last before this place becomes your E.N.D?\u00a0</p><br/>\n<p>Currently, an Early Access is planned to start Late October 2018 provided the game gets enough support to fund these efforts. If not, this may delay it\u00a0further with an Estimated Release pushing the game's developmental release\u00a0into Mid\u00a02019. You can help speed this process up by donating and thanks in advance for your support.</p>\n\n\n<p>You are Asher Willson, a young adult that had it pretty good for awhile. But, trouble always seemed to have a way of finding you even when you tried to head in the opposite direction. So eventually you packed your stuff up, hitched your trailer and headed off down the road in\u00a0your old run down car.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as luck would have it your car broke down leaving you stranded in the middle of freaking nowhere! A few hours went by, you even began trying to fix\u00a0your car when a strange scream for help shattered out of the darkened woods behind you just to the south. You could've swore there wasn't a path there before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Against your better judgement you grabbed a shotgun from your car and headed down through the treeline met by a\u00a0strange forest of decaying trees.\u00a0Oddly, you can't seem to remember how you got there or how to get back when\u00a0you spotted a sign ahead pointing to a rather creepy looking Cabin just\u00a0down the path.</p>\n<p>A chill begins to creep down your spine. \u201cSomething feels very wrong about this place\u201d, you thought to yourself.\u00a0 At the front, you notice the Cabin\u2019s door is busted down with a\u00a0warning\u00a0painted in blood before the doorway. Starring inward there's blood is everywhere as if something just happened moments ago but, all is quiet, too quiet as you enter the Cabin neglectfully. Come to think of it you recall hearing a Legend about\u00a0some guy in\u00a0a Cabin that was said to have been\u00a0destroyed years ago where something Terribly Evil happened..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>ENEMY WAVES - fight to survive as long as you can against an increasing amount of difficultly becoming demons that want to rip you to shreds.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>GUNS GALORE - you're armed with a handgun but if you kill enough demons maybe you can find something better than just one measly gun..</li></ul>\n<ul><li>UPGRADES - perhaps if you scrounge around you might be able to find something more useful to prepare yourself before more demons arrive.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0ALTARS - scrounging around a means to upgrade your gear you notice strange demonic ruins scattered about with three gruesome-looking books to choose from or dare you chance it to see if something good or bad happens.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>SECRETS &amp; MORE - there will be many secrets to find in the game and additionally depending on how well the game does there are plans to expand on the game with some really cool things to make it even more uniquely interesting!</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>The Wrong Book is our uniquely defined horrific choice and consequence\u00a0system unlike any other to date. This technology is designed to allow players to risk your kills to\u00a0reap potential full rewards while fighting an onslaught of never-ending evil or face the ultimate evil at hand in the worst ways, the choice is yours!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Evil Never Dies is a game that has been greatly inspired and based upon the roots of the highly popular and horrifying\u00a0Evil Dead Franchise. With that said it also pays a lot of homage to it with unique inspiring evil ways that would make even Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi proud. Horror Fans alike can also find\u00a0Key Locations, Gear, &amp;\u00a0Secrets.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>WHY PRE-ORDER?</strong></p>\n<p>We're a small Indie Team and we have a very small budget plus we are trying to outsource a few things to speed up development. However, in the amidst of all of this chaos we are also trying to not only finish it but doing several other things at the same time just to survive financially (working a day job,\u00a0doing side projects, selling game assets, etc). Doing these things forces us to delay END's development and causes delays and we don't want that. Instead, we want to make it our ultimate goal of providing you with the best horror game we can possibly give you!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>HELP US GET THE GAME ON STEAM!</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone whom helps support our game that buys it to day for at least $14.99 will receive a Free Steam Key + Special 2 Week Early Access Invite as an extra thanks from us to you.
