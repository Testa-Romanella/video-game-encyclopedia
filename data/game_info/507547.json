{"id": 507547, "slug": "lightspeed-timboe", "name": "LIGHTSPEED (timboe)", "name_original": "LIGHTSPEED (timboe)", "description": "Playing the Game\r\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0or the\u00a0<strong>arrow keys</strong>\u00a0to navigate your ship.\u00a0<strong>A/left-arrow</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>D/right-arrow</strong>\u00a0control your orientation while\u00a0<strong>W/up-arrow</strong>\u00a0fires your rear thruster and\u00a0<strong>S/down-arrow</strong>\u00a0fires your weaker front thruster. These are powerful thrusters which boost your ship following the equations of\u00a0relativistic acceleration\u00a0(your thrusters change your momentum, but your velocity is the hyperbolic tangent of your ships rapidity).</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This game has no audio.</p>\r\nArcade Mode\r\n<p>As the game progresses the speed of light slowly decreases while the speeds of the asteroids increase. In the later portions of the game this will even result in superluminal asteroids! These `tachyoids\u2019 show up a scintillating yellow colour. Mentally extrapolate their trajectory and make sure you your ship is\u00a0<em>elsewhere</em>\u00a0located otherwise you\u2019ll be hit first, then see yourself getting hit moments later. Tachyoids have no respect for\u00a0causality. The game is over when you have lost all of your lives.</p>\r\nSandbox Mode\r\n<p>Sandbox mode lets you play with the game mechanic. Use the controls at the top to add/remove asteroids, set their speed and play with the speed of light. In addition to the normal controls, you can click-and-drag to relocate your ship.</p>\n<p>Also shown in the display is your ships fractional velocity of the speed of light,\u00a0<em>\u03b2</em>, and its corresponding\u00a0Lorentz factor,\u00a0<em>\u03b3</em>. The red line shows which way your ship is oriented and the blue line its current speed and heading.</p>\n<p>The option to show\u00a0<strong>True Positions</strong>\u00a0(or,\u00a0<em>cheat mode</em>) renders the outline of the\u00a0<em>actual</em>\u00a0positions of the asteroids. Lines are also drawn to connect the\u00a0<em>true</em>\u00a0positron with any\u00a0<em>apparent</em>\u00a0positions, as observed by your ship.</p>\n<p>As the asteroids move through space, they are continuously emitting photon shells. These shells encode the position and velocity of the asteroid at the time of their creation and subsequently expand outward at the speed of light. The information stored in the photon shells in the immediate vicinity of your ship is used to render the observed scene. By enabling the\u00a0<strong>Photon Shells</strong>\u00a0option, the propagation of the shells is visualised.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay Options\r\n<p>In reality, the effects of relativity are intimately interconnected. In this game however, some laws of physics my be conveniently enabled or disabled at your pleasure on the title screen.</p>\r\nToroidal Mode\r\n<p>When enabled, the universe is of the classic never-ending variety with the left edge-of-space stitched to the right and the top to the bottom. The topology of such a universe is a\u00a0<em>Torus</em>\u00a0or doughnut shaped. With Toroidal Mode off, the universe is edged with perfectly elastic walls which instantaneously bounce your ship back.\u00a0</p>\r\nLength Contraction\r\n<p>One of the ways the universe distorts such that the speed of light remains constant to all observers is the apparent\u00a0contraction\u00a0of the universe at relativistic velocities, along the direction of motion. The true contraction is the reciprocal of the Lorentz factor. However as a concession to keep the game vaguely playable, the magnitude of the length contraction effect is decreased by 90%.</p>\r\nRelativistic Doppler Shift\r\n<p>For large relative velocities between your ship and an asteroid, the light from the asteroid is either blue-shifted if it is approaching or red-shifted if it is receding from you. Enabling\u00a0Relativistic Doppler Shift\u00a0implements this effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8ef0b48ad5735bf9c7498d480283691c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["timboe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
