After killing the square another one will appear and\u00a0you will lose your gun and have to grab another one. You lose when the square touches you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2b2a28cd12b72387ebae61d75f908c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mertmerp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
