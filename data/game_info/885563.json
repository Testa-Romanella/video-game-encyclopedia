Feeling like I really enjoy these tiny game jams! Essentially made classic Snake but without being confined to a grid, and also with no direction controls of your own.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>Snake but harder<br/></strong>No direction controls. To move where you want, try to get the timing of the pointer arrow correct.<br/>180 degree movement, no grids.</li><li><strong>Snake but easier<br/></strong>Snake doesn't move on its own - take your time.<br/>The walls can't kill you - only your own tail can.<br/>More food - no need to hunt down one piece of food, multiple spawn exponentially.</li><li><strong>Easy<br/></strong>A slight challenge at best - this game was meant to be a quick win, not a rage-inducer.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was thrown together by\u00a0<strong>Asith\u00a0</strong><em>(@AsithDevs\u00a0on Twitter).</em>\u00a0Stick around for more random stuff. I have no idea what I could make next!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T10:30:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9efb5497250b912b453545bfef2cdc70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
