Inertia is a space racing simulator created in three days for the November 2016 Unreal Engine game jam competition. This game aims to demonstrate how the physics of local area flight in space works. Unfortunately this means the controls will not be as \"easy\" as most space flight sims today, since in reality, <em><strong>an object in motion stays in motion</strong></em>. Navigate through the checkpoints to complete two maps in the fastest time that you can. Hopefully you'll learn something new about how inertia and zero-g movement work in the vacuum of space!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e0084f18a5ca5859d79ee8ff32e62ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fresh Lemonade"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
