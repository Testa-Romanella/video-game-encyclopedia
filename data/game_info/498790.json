In the future I will try my best\u00a0make a better, cooler and more beautiful game.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to help me\u00a0 financially (to buy Unity Enterprise), just make a small donation. (1.50$)</strong><strong> I will be as happy, as a poor game developer might be.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c1c77d1e83bd024469d3fed6676028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["moondie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
