I was able to place some NPCs and objects in the left lower floor of the building and finished the cameras for walking around the park. Second floor and other rooms are empty and there is no interaction and no dialogue.<br/></p>\n<p>You can still walk around to not miss out on the amazing soundtrack. ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T03:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bfc741842d4953f35768baf534c0d50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Odrez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
