However you lose points if you add the same card again.<br/>- You win when all the cards are gone.  However you lose if your score reaches below 0.<br/><br/>With a pleasing minimalistic design, try to beat others on the leaderboard or get lost in the zen of matching suits.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e4545342833ed38310c1315f8983c41e.jpg", "website": "http://jamesswiney.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["James Swiney"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["James Swiney"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
