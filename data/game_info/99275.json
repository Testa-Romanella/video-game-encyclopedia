I'm working on a polished version which will be ready somwhere in 2018 so please stay tuned!</p>\n<p>--------------------</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 39 in 72 hours, the game is very rough around the edges. There's no sound whatsoever and unfortunately I didn't have time to implement time-rewind nor in-game hints, there are also some game breaking bugs... Also the nature of the game requires that you will probably need to restart it a few times. Unfortunately you'll need to to do it manually by restarting the game. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\u00a0All of that will be corrected/added in the post-jam version which is comming...</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you're stuck, check out the spoiler free hints &amp; complete walkthrough that you can find here.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a913956073bab18bbf16587180baaa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["axoona"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
