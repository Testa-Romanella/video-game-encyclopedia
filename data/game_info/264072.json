I'm down . . there going to hold me, but I'll escape!!\"<br/><br/>\"I'm not a pilot, but I'll manage to fly outta here!!!\"<br/><br/>You've been captured by the enemy.  You manage to escape.  Since you are not a trained pilot, you are going to have a difficult time flying these aircraft.  Its up to you to inflict maximum damage on the enemy.  You have 4 aircraft to choose from.  <br/><br/>--The fast and powerful Tornado<br/>--The sleek and heavily armed Reaper Drone<br/>--The classic WW2 War Plane<br/>--The Navy Jet<br/><br/>Each aircraft has its own special abilities. <br/><br/>Hints : There are BONUS cut scene sequences when you destroy the Battleship and the Nuclear Reactor (White Cooling Tower)<br/><br/>Note : **These airplanes have been made intentionally difficult to fly.  Please don't complain about bad controls.  They are supposed to be bad - this guy is not a pilot.<br/><br/>To the female fans out there - we wish there were more models made for female pilots.  They are few and far between.  So, we had to use a dude in this game - sorry about that.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T04:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b92d45887b961197b6659f824ee2257e_3SU4ogi.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sharkweed"], "genres": ["RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Sharkweed"], "esrb_rating": null}
