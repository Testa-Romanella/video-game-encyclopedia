{"id": 692950, "slug": "the-prisoner-en-c64-oric", "name": "The Prisoner (EN) [C64 & Oric]", "name_original": "The Prisoner (EN) [C64 & Oric]", "description": "<p><strong>History: </strong><br/><br/>Patrick McGoohan conceived and starred in The Prisoner in a series that aired between 1967 and 1968 and ran for 17 episodes. Ahead of its time, it has been and continues to be a cult series and totally current. <br/></p>\n<p>The series begins with the resignation of the protagonist to the position of him, within the British secret service. He, returning to his apartment, plans to quickly leave the place and go far away, but he is surprised by a numbing gas and is taken to a mysterious coastal town called La Villa. There, he will be assigned number 6 and will try to escape in every possible way while he tries to find out who is number 1 and if it is this who runs the Village. <br/></p>\n<p>It is curious that fiction connects with reality in an almost insulting way since Patrick McGoohan was tired of shooting Danger Man, the series in which he was the protagonist, and he needed a change. He played the role of John Drake for 4 seasons with a total of 86 chapters and in the end it was a slab that he wanted to get out of.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>We are in front of a classical text adventure.
