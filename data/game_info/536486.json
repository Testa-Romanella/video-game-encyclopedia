To start place level select on the podium in front of you, select a level, then pull the lever. You can press the \"secondary button\" on either controller (Y or B on Oculus Quest 2) to bring up a menu in the middle of a level if you wish to leave or restart. This game has only been tested on an Oculus Quest 2 so let me know if there are any issues on other devices and I will try to find a fix.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for checking the project out, I appreciate you. \\(~_~\\)</p>\n\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Artist: DJ Quads</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/djquads/<br/></p>\n<p>Liscense:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc885ba6e56cd7265747377017296e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Hyperspace Wizard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
