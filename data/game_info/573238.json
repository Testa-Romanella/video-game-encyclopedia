With accurate light physics, make use of reflection and refraction to control the path of light. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe laser beams are created with red, green and blue lasers that blend together. As the different wavelengths refract at different angles you can use dispersion to separate them into individual beams of light. Or you can pass the beam through a filter to reflect the other wavelengths.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the tools provided to direct one or more laser beams, to mix and separate colours, open doors, hit targets and solve the puzzles, many with multiple solutions. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeaturing 42 puzzles, original music, no timer or locked puzzles, complete the game at your own pace.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T03:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86fecdfa6ef8fa504098d8d735e304f.jpg", "website": "https://www.vectmatica.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vectmatica"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vectmatica"], "esrb_rating": null}
