Now, after 240 worked streets in his hometown 'Citylight', he was supposed to be back at the entrance gates to the headquarters of the local road maintenance department, as his builders had actually designed it. But the impossible seems to have happened\u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0MID-SQUARE is somewhere in the labyrinthine street canyons of his hometown with limited energy reserves in his batteries and doesn't know what to do. Help him back on his way through the streets of 'Citylight' and keep a close eye on his power consumption, because careless maneuvering of the small robot can quickly end in a dead end and cost one of three of its rechargeable batteries.\"</em></p>\n<p>Fold'em is a puzzle game where the player has to clear all other (white) squares with his own blue square (robot). A \"folding\" effect is created, which is the inspiration for the name of the game. You have 3 failed attempts (level restart) available, but since there is a password after each completed level, the time limit shouldn't be a problem either.</p>\n<p><strong>Simply designed, but definitely interesting in terms of play, Fold'em provides 240 entertaining maze puzzles!!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:45:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c2606bb884c5cc0d22274eb55351423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["INC-X GDG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
