What better way to end the school year than to spend it at an all expenses paid stay at a luxury mansion for a whole month? After all, after this month, everyone's going to be moving away to focus on their chosen paths in life, so this is the last time that everyone's going to be together for a long way.</p>\n<p>Will romance flourish in the time spent isolated in a mansion, living the high life? Or is this all an elaborate ploy by someone pulling the strings at the mansion itself that just sees the group as a bunch of playthings for something much more sinister? Expect a story full of questions and mysteries as the friends suffer through tragedy, death, and a looming threat that grows ever closer all while trying to remember the nicer times in their lives before everything may come to an abrupt end.</p>\n<p>Characters will die, decisions must be made, and shying away from the consequences of such will only make the journey forward harder. Can you change their fate by using the mysterious vault that seemingly wants a password to open? Is this your one salvation to save everyone?</p><p>https://www.patreon.com/PASSWORDVN<br/>https://twitter.com/passwordvn<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T03:47:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e0e65746201b5c6f05bad6fcebfcb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Grizz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
