Lucky enough to make it out with his life but unluckily without family or relatives, he is in no shape to look after himself due to his injuries. What he does have left is his adventurer\u2019s spirit, which fuels his hopes to make a full recovery and head out to face the world again.<br/><br/>In the meantime, what he needs is someone to take care of him...<br/>But having been deceived by a band he thought he trusted, and now being grievously wounded, what he\u2019s shortest on is faith in anyone else. Complicating the situation even further, word of the fortune Garland acquired through his personal disaster has spread far enough that everyone he meets seems to be after his money. If he had his health he might have little to fear, but as the situation stands, he needs help that he can rely on. At the moment, Garland needs assistance to survive.<br/><br/>As he mulls over what to do, the news reaches his ears that his homeland has captured a certain smaller nation. He also happens to see in passing some citizens from that fallen nation, perhaps captured during the takeover, being transported to be sold off as indentured servants. As an adventurer who believes in freedom, Garland doesn\u2019t like the idea, but with such unfortunates trust is optional: magic makes them obedient. <br/><br/>After much consideration and lacking other options, he makes the decision to get the help he needs\u2014whatever it costs.<h3>CHARACTERS</h3><br/>Alienor (Voice: Aika Kashiwagi)<br/><br/>The eldest princess-in-exile of the fallen kingdom of Pixenzax.

During a physical examination after her capture, she was found to have a birthmark unique to royalty and was thus treated as a high-status hostage.<br/>When Garland comes to town to hire help, she meets her destiny.<br/><br/><br/>Farna (Voice: Miina Ayukawa)<br/><br/>Princess Alienor\u2019s lady-in-waiting.<br/><br/>She loves Alienor as if she were her own sister.

Convincing the shopkeep that she and Allie could turn him a tidy profit if Garland were to buy the two as a set, she succeeds in pushing them through as a package deal.<br/>She trusts Garland to some extent on account of his personality.<br/><br/><br/>Garland (Voice: -)<br/><br/>An adventurer who hopes to return to his occupation and the main character of this game.<br/><br/>After the death of his parents, he left his unremarkable hometown for the city to become an adventurer.
