{"id": 702702, "slug": "shroomworld", "name": "shroomworld", "name_original": "shroomworld", "description": "<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>\n<p><em>A once prosperous village flourishing from the powers of alchemy and magic now lies before you,</em></p>\n<p><em>leaving only remnants of mysterious crystals scattered throughout this ruined landscape.</em></p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The world we are creating is based around the concept of past and present, following the struggle\u00a0</p>\n<p>in securing an important and finite resource. This finite resource, being crystals, is the link between\u00a0</p>\n<p>timelines and acts as a portal that the player can take to traverse between worlds. Since there are going to be two worlds, there are going to be two different settings. The present depicts a ruined rustic village that shows signs of development in the fields of alchemy and magic. This village contained collapsed buildings, shattered lamp posts, and overgrown foliage that depicted a landscape that has been devoid of human presence for a significant amount of time. The structures are elevated off the ground, using trees as a support. These structures are all connected to each other using bridges. Among the manmade objects, there is a world tree, a tree that acts as the center of the village. The trees themselves peek a faint glow through the bark. You, the player, arrive at this scene during night, to only be surrounded by moonlight, animals and insects, and a fog that blocks vision of the ground. After navigating through the village, the player finds a crystal, which is an interactable object. By touching the crystal, a portal is opened to the past world, one which is vastly different from the ruins. The player enters this world at dusk, with the previously bustling activity of this village slowly dying down as families begin to enjoy their time together at the dinner table. The lamp posts begin to flicker on, and the player moves through this world seeing the seemingly endless sight of a flourishing civilization. After some time, the player is ejected from this world, returning to the previous one. The crystal is no longer glowing, signifying that it has exhausted its power.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROL</strong></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - Move around</p>\n<p>MOUSE - Look around</p>\n<p><strong>Art 107 - Section 01 - Fall 2021</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team KANS</strong></p>\n<p>Project Producer: Niloofar Banaei</p>\n<p>Lead Designer: Soovin Choi</p>\n<p>Lead Unity Developer: Adrian Tsang</p>\n<p>Lead Interaction Designer: Kevin Sagara</p>\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong></p>\n<p>Sounds:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/smand/sounds/521035/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-ambiant-cinematic-drone-main-10526/</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/YsiaBSHGenE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T06:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b76c7d5447a6a35eff2f7860255c1b2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdrianTsang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
