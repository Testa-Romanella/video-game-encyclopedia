If you remove 2 pairs (9+1, summ 10) and click rewrite, you see this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and you will not see 9's again. It's not a problem it's original rules of the game. It's a part of a game or your strategy - choose right way to win.<br/><br/>The objective is to cross out neighbouring (vertically or continiously) pairs of digits to completely empty the screen. You can cross out the same numbers or the ones that give a total of 10. <br/><br/>Features: <br/>\u2022 Classic game with numbers from 1 to 19 <br/>\u2022 Random game for advanced players <br/>\u2022 Achievements for fun with numbers! <br/>\u2022 Up to 20 undo steps, don't worry about mistakes <br/>\u2022 Undo by finger swiping<br/>\u2022 Score, time, lines, pairs and left pairs statistics<br/>\u2022 Different high scores for Classic and Random games <br/>\u2022 Saving results to Camera Roll<br/>\u2022 Demo mode for training<br/>\u2022 iPad, iPad Retina, iPhone, iPhone Retina, iPhone 5 Support<br/>\u2022 Game Center Support", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd9/cd90345e51c86674cbcd3ba1551116d1_jNSO437.jpg", "website": "http://www.okroshka-lab.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Okroshka Lab"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Artem Demidenko"], "esrb_rating": null}
