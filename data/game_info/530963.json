This is my first time using a proper game engine, Godot, and I'm so glad I finally know how to program. This is the culmination of my first month of learning how to program videogames TwT</p>\n<p><strong>Also, a slight notice:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If the game triggers your antivirus, it's because I had to use Resource Hacker to change the .ico file of the .exe in order to have it use the custom icon I made rather than Godot's basic icon.\r\nIf only it was a lot easier to do that without using 3rd party software. Anyways, I won't gain anything from giving people viruses anyways, and I doubt my 1 month of programming skills is enough to even make a virus. Anyways, have fun</p>\n<p><strong>Another notice:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Due to this being a mere school project and only meant to kickstart my programming skills, it will forever be stuck at Beta 0.4\r\nI have no intentions to continue development nor finish this game. The deadline for it is on Dec 14, 2020 anyways, so I kinda have to upload it now, aaaaaa-</p>\n<p>Lead Developer:\r\n<br/>me\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Lead Artist:\r\n<br/>MIjzie\r\n<br/>IG: rish_draws</p>\n<p>Lead Animator:\r\n<br/>me <em>(hA the animations suck and I'm proud of it cause it's the best I can do TwT)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T04:19:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a8524334706649665d3cb4893633bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Razeacc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
