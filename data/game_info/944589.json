Feedback is welcome in the comments.</strong>\n<p>It's the year 21XX, and Earth has completely been invaded by aliens, rendering it uninhabitable. Now the aliens want to attack Mars, where the last remnants of humanity reside in a colony. Build your Mars colony up to gather enough resources to also build towers that can defend against the aliens' attacks.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Camera movement:</strong> To move the camera around, drag your mouse on the map.</li><li><strong>Buildings/Towers:</strong> To place down a building or tower, drag and drop from the Build tab. You will need sufficient resources to do so, and possibly you will need to unlock it with research (magnifying glass icon) by tapping the lock icon.\u00a0 The Control Center (the central building) is unbuildable and produces energy, and people who work there can produce research.</li><li><strong>Humans:</strong> Humans will need to consume food and water to survive. Adults will be able to work at workplaces to produce resources. The Control Center both houses people and is a workplace.</li><li><strong>Aliens:</strong> Every round until Round 15, aliens will come from the top and proceed toward the base. When defeated, they will have a chance of dropping some resources. During this time, you will not be able to place down any buildings and towers, and humans will not go to work.</li></ul>\n<p>All code and art for this game was made by me (Yousurname). The music is made by AI. This game does not reflect how living on Mars would be in real life.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/8486387ffb50cd1fe767b5a2f4060306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yousurname"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
