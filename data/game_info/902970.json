It's heavily inspired by Tower of Druaga, one of my favorite arcade games. I would've liked to have made something a little more original, but I\u00a0didn't give myself enough time to do it. Regardless, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and I hope you enjoy it.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T03:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15ff855f9c33aa9b3917ccfd89baebd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wasted Time Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
