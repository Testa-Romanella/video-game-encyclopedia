But a bird has no hands, so how are you meant to deliver eggs across the city? A rope! Your trusty delivery rope connects you and your eggs, and you can drag them along as you soar through the skies.</p>\n<p>Slow and steady wins the race, though, as going too fast will result in your parcels becoming an egg-y stain on the pavement.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A/D or L/R Arrows\u00a0</strong>- Move Left / Right</p>\n<p><strong>Space (Press) -</strong> Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Space (Hold) - </strong>Glide</p>\n<p><strong>Escape/P - </strong>Pause</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Music Credits:</em></strong></p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/happy-synths-loop-with-slight-christmas-feeling<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d918ef2a47c67eef6f8a7a446a8a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TomRobson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
