She thinks that each drop has a beautiful story behind it that fills her life with the colors of the imagination. Colors that she uses against Ni, the Ink Demon, that only wants a world covered in darkness.</p>\r\nThe Idea\r\n<p>Designing games is my life. For that reason, I transform my life into a game every day. Each experience that we live can become into great mechanic, story, or experience on which to base a game. From time to time, I use that knowledge to improve my game designer skills. I watch my surroundings and pick something. Sometimes it is something that I am doing, like cleaning the house; sometimes it is something that I see. I try to reduce it to just a word. And with that, I design a game. I only have two rules: 1, what I choose needs to be the essence of the game, be present in each corner. And 2, I need to design it in less than 5 minutes. These two rules force me to be creative and don\u2019t overthink the idea.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how I designed this game. I looked up through the window and chose the word \"Rain\". Sometimes I design complicated games with complicated systems, but other times, like this one, I just wanted to create something simple and funny.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was also born from the idea to use what makes us happy to fight against all those things that make us sad. If something makes us happy, it doesn\u2019t care how stupid it is, we should use it to fight against the darkness. A darkness that can come at any moment, and we should be ready to use all our stored happiness, all that good memories, and stories to fight and prevail. To don\u2019t let that demon eat us.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>If you want to read the GDD, you can do it here.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<strong>The Art of Fill My Life With Colors</strong>\r\nConcept Art\r\n\r\nFirst Gameplay Concept\r\n\nStoryboard Amanda's Transformation\nWalking Animation\nAmanda's Attack\nAmanda's Attack\nBackground\nBackground Animation Tests\nRejected Game Over Animation\nClean Amanda\r\nThe Art of Fill My Life With Colors\r\nFinal Art\r\nWalking Animation\nNi's Face\nAmanda's Attack\r\nOST\r\nMusic by Dylan Cocozzo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nGame Design\r\n<p>Tamar Sandoval</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>Tamar Sandoval</p>\r\nProgramming\r\n<p>Francisco L\u00f3pez</p>\r\nSound\r\n<p>Tamar Sandoval</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Dylan Cocozzo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T10:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c219918bad2db75a240caf216796a78c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gas Mask War Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
