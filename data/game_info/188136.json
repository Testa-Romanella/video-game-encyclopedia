If so, please go back to physics class, because this game isnt about that. You act as a border offical, catching illegal immigriants red handed and letting the majority through. But If you send the wrong electrons to the ground or let the illegal ones through, you're power will lower and eventually, it will run out and you'll lose. Too sad. You can be the \"Border offical\" in an iron cable (I dont know if they make cables out of iron, probably not) and copper cable. As the logic suggest, in the copper cable more electrons will come. Be prepared! (This game is all about fun, it is not representing any real physics releated stuff)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c6/4c62dd072eea0e1f6b1e27932113bd6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Royal Newt Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
