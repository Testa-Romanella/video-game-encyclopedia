Star in it with 3 or fewer friends and try to fish for as long as possible without falling in the water, which will be fatal!</p>\n<p>Fishing will be pretty peaceful, allowing you to enjoy the nice weather at sea but beware of the storm, where ocean creatures go wild and will aggressively try making you fall to certain death.\r\n</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry too much about dying though, cause in this game life after death IS a thing. Get reincarnated as a seagull and stop other players from scoring or avenge your death by making them fall into the hostile waters.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Take a look at the\u00a0 controls for the best playing experience:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T14:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2a5f0930989f927ffd1526780796f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["euremne", "PepijnVerhaert", "JochenR", "dawndelirus", "KillianVermeer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
