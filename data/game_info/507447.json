I'm Daru'Nyuech'k the Annihilator of Worlds and Collector of Untold Treasures, also known as Craig. I hear you're looking for a job as an inter-dimensional lost and found clerk? Well let me tell you, you'll meet some interesting people asking for some interesting things. I've seen everything from demons from hell to popular anime figures brought to life, and when they lose something they look here first!\r\nI have a reputation to upkeep though, so give people wrong items or tell them we don't have what they're looking for when we do, that's my reputation you're ruining! I'll give you a first few strikes on the house, but 3 and you're outta here!\r\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>25 characters, each with custom voice lines</li><li>Over 30 unique items</li><li>Original sound track</li><li>Procedurally generated dialogue</li><li>A whole bunch of references<br/>\u00a0 </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kennedy Adams - Voice Acting</li><li>SYNTY Studios - Awesome Models</li><li>ZapSplat.com\u00a0-\u00a0SFX</li><li>FreeSound.org - SFX</li><li>Ontario Tech GDSA</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd58388853efdd29bec70f8e3940a4c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matthew Holt", "TopHatMuffin", "Moishe Grosh", "SageMade"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
