Upgradable weapons?  Let&#39;s say there\u2019re dozens of on-screen enemies to unleash this firepower on, and as your reward for dispatching them you get experience and gold to collect that can be used for character customization and new equipment--all the while playing alongside friends in 4-player cooperative play!  If you like the sound of all this, then you&#39;ll love God Mode.<br />\nRetro shooter action and RPG elements are combined in this new downloadable third-person shooter. God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode, and features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed title. Matches rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game modifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually evolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued and used to unlock new and satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be further upgraded.Key Features:Cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players (with special PvP locations)<br />\nCollect gold and experience to unlock upgradable weapons and abilities<br />\nExtensive character customization<br />\nDozens of Tests of Faith (in-game modifiers) dynamically alter gameplay in each level</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2013-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T17:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa60e9b12af3fa810c905eaa39d306f.jpg", "website": "http://www.atlus.com/godmode", "rating": 2.56, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 550, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 20, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 64, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Saber Interactive", "Atlus U.S.A", "Old School Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Atlus", "Atlus USA"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
