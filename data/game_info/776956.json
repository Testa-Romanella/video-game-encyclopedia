Do you feel  nostalgic of the old good time when you had taken care of your best  friend:  The Tamagotchi! But don\u2019t get me wrong this is not a  Tamagotchi-like game. This game is just a bit harder and we put some  surprise in it. Will you succeed to find all the possible endings?\r\n </p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>Take  care of your new best friend. If he got hungry, you only have to push  the feed button. This is the same for the other needs.\r\n </p>\n<p>This is much harder than what you can think \ud83d\ude09\r\n </p>\r\nEndings List:\r\n<ul><li>Over eating\r\n</li><li>Gremlins\r\n</li><li>Trump\r\n</li><li>Glitch\r\n</li><li>Geek\r\n</li><li>Mad scientist\r\n</li><li>Abandon\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>For now, we are students.
