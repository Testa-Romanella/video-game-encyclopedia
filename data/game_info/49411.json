Your palms are sweaty and your heart pounds deep in your chest. You are about to enter the Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce, an ancient Roman Arena, and do battle in front of a blood-thirsty crowd of thousands. The locals want a fierce competition, and want to see all of your fighting skills, using an array of available weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStanding in the centre of the arena, the observer has 360 degree views inside the reconstructed amphitheatre. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow picture yourself as a spectator. You walk through the streets of Lut\u00e8ce (modern-day Paris) towards the Arena, with 12,000-16,000 spectators as companions, anticipating a relaxing day of pleasure watching the blood-sports of the day. You take your seat next to other excited visitors and watch the drama unfold in the centre of the arena.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSeated in the arena, you can imagine what it was like to watch gladiatorial contests, games with wild beasts and, as a complete contrast, plays with the stage area capable of turning into a theatre. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance.
