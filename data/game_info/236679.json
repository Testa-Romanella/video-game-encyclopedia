And during the making of this prototype I've been the only one!</p>\n<p>The original concept of this game is that a group of creatures known as Pumpians were captured except for one. Your mission is to venture out and find all Pumpians who were held captive .</p>\n<p>With a little help of references, I\u00a0was able to do the art, the music, and the mechanics all by myself. This project dates back around 2014 of March. This (I believe) has potential. So I want to see how well receive this will get, even if it's a prototype.</p>\n<p>As of the uploading of the file, I was in the middle of testing other potential weapons that you'll get within the game (though that's minutes of gameplay away from actually achieveing them).</p>\n<p>So you can say that you get a little of a spoiler. If you would not like that, and would like the game played at the original state (no weapons, no items, and the default amount of lives), you can contact me at kayaneseera@gmail.com, and I'll send you a modified file where you can have fun with the full experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're still not satisfied, then at least I appreciate you trying out this game. I've hesistated so long to actually bring it to the world, but now, I think it's time.</p>\n<p>If you have any more questions, contact me with the email provided!</p>\n\n<p>(And please, I did my best, but I\u00a0only have the lite version to the program I used... there's going to be an annoying watermark display. I apologize in advance. I mean... it is a prototype after all...
