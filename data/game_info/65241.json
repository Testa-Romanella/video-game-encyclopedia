Well now you can be an alchemist and do just that. Well not in real life (because it will probably end up badly) but you can pretend that you're a real life alchemist and it will be just as good. With multiple levels and difficulties, each one having unique ingredients, you can create many different types of concoctions. From a small vial of weakness to a large potion of health with more variants waiting to be added.Key Features<br/><ul><li> 12 levels (more coming)<br/></li><li> 3 difficulties (Easy, Normal and Hard)<br/></li><li> 52 unique ingredients (more coming)<br/></li><li> Achievements for your progress (none implemented yet)</li></ul><br/>Please note that this is in its very early stages and the content is very limited.
