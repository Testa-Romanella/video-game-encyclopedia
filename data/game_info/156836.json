{"id": 156836, "slug": "balloonworld", "name": "BalloonWorld", "name_original": "BalloonWorld", "description": "<p>Balloon World (working title) is a procedurally generated space. The player navigates the space with a balloon animal and inflates the other balloons until they pop. There is no objective to the game. The world is a space with no consequences. Even though balloons are destroyed, another balloon is generated in its place. The world is a commentary on the disposable and replaceable nature of our society. The player should feel a temporary sense of guilt for popping the balloons, but then instant relief when another balloon is generated.</p><p>I began the project by experimenting with procedural terrain generation. I then used the instantiate function in unity to generate spheres. The most difficult part of the process for me was the 3D modeling in Maya. I had originally wanted to make 10+ balloon models, but after hours spent on one model realized this was not possible. Another difficulty I had was with procedurally generating the sound. Right now, the inflate sound only works on the second generation of instantiated balloons. </p><p>I was very inspired by 10 print for this project. Procedural generation was an integral part to my concept. It was important that the world felt very random, and inconsequential. While I didn't use the 10 print code exactly, the same principles apply to the instantiation code I used within the world. Basic probability and the random function made the world feel slightly less uniform and a bit more chaotic. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/1746bec1c179dd587fa6bc069fb582a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["courtneyS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
