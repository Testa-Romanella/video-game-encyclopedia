Play as a polygon, with the ability to grow by picking up \"sides\", dropped by defeated enemies. Fend of enemy red polygons, and defeat them with your abilities, or by leading them into randomly generated obstacles. Maneuver through enemies and obstacles, managing your size and enemy count, and survive.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Left-click to launch a single side straight out</li><li>Right-click to split into two and launch the other half</li><li>Spacebar to self-destruct, reducing yourself to 3 sides</li></ul>\n<p>A GeoJam 22 submission, inspired by time-survival games. Maybe it can be expanded to a free-for-all PvP game?</p>\n<p>Used Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>LeanTween\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595</li><li>Better Minimal WebGL Template https://seansleblanc.itch.io/better-minimal-webgl-template<br/></li></ul>\n<p>Made by myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:20:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86bd6d0a438d92d6455bc903b1af3cb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["onglez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
