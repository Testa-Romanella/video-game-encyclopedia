They exist to love. There is no war.</p><p>One problem. They create Special Custard, a substance which to them is just a nutrient food. But to humanity, it grants extended life and is rich in minerals unseen on Earth.</p><p>You are Reginald Waft, a savvy British hipster businessman who's left it all - cheeky fried chicken with the lads, banter for days and even the occasional episode of your nearest soap opera with your mum - to ransack the planet. You might even take the concept of their planet and sell it to some British TV channel as a children's programme.</p><p>Go with your array of missiles that grapple onto things to steer, and also somehow collect the abundant Special Custard. Missile those cutesy swines before they sing you a song about learning things. And then get back to the lads back in Britain, drop a couple beers, re-curl your moustache and smash up the local gym.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06dc3568077c32325e5101478e5eef69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
