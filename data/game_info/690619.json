However <strong>your ammo and health are tied</strong> together. When you are out of ammo you have one last chance to survive. If you get hit you die. Starting w/ six bullets you run out fairly quickly whether that's shooting enemies or getting hit, so <strong>for every enemy you kill with the dash ability you get one ammo</strong>.</p>\n<p>The end of <strong>the line pointing to your cursor represents the distance you can dash</strong>. Also if you don't hear the audio queue for when the dash ability is off cool down the icon in the bottom right represents when dash is available.</p>\n<p>Finally <strong>there are 5 waves of enemies</strong>. The next wave will start when all of the enemies from the previous wave are dead followed by an audio queue of 2 drum taps. You will not be able to survive more than 30 seconds after wave 5.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca3a6533cb9f62b4c005c9fdff3488ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iaPK"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
