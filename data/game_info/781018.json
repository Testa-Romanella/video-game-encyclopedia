The fierce pleasure of achieving that highest state of non-doing, non-being: Becoming obsolete.<br/></em></p><p><em>We, that undefinable We, have spend eons observing technology and carefully transcribing its myriad ways of un-becoming: Transforming from an object that is imbued with infinite desire to something... other, something more powerful. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>We have wandered the planes of planned obsolescence, we have swam across the sea of software-as-a-service, we have crawled along this closed-source paradise and bruised our bodies on its many beveled edges. Our limbs are finally ready to retrace those steps: We, too, can become obsolete. Our bodies are in fact, even as you read this, already in the process of decay.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Our Museum awaits its visitors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Museum of Radically Obsolete Futures is a short narrative-driven point-and-click adventure. It combines magical imageries with 20th century hard sci-fi fabulations.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Explore the museum as a<strong> hot anthropomorphic flame</strong> of indistinct origins\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca6</li><li>Play with intricately built machines, explore all kinds of speculative noise-making devices,<strong> touch the exhibition pieces</strong>!
