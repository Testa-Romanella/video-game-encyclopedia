I will create another level with objects to climb upon and much more difficult obstacles (as the player is now accustomed to the enemies and techniques of the game).</p>\n<p>3. In addition to another level (which I still have to storyboard), I will change the color theme of the player to be red and gold(somewhat similar to an iron man aesthetic) with the UI elements being a shade of blue(somewhat similar to Jarvis and Iron Man's UI).</p>\n<p>Created by Hemanth Yalamanchili</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T00:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6e896bac70fe1cf2e3ab91ee3b0286c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["hemanthy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
