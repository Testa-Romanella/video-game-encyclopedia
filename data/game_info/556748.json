Nobody knows if it's ever going to open up again, and rumors are rampant about the entire incident being caused by the computer having run into error state. Not wanting to wait for help from outside, one resident decides to escape on his own. The underground facility has a single exit, open no matter what.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem : Security Bots cover every inch, and they're not going to let any one out.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe weapon is your only way out.\r\n<p>Inspired by early home computer top down shooters, Phasearm tries to be a vibrant and thrilling hunt to the top of the highscore lists. The labyrinth consists of a random conjunction of prebuild rooms forcing you to quickly adapt to your new surroundings. After a few rounds you'll be relentlessly chased by one and later two fearsome robots who'll force\u00a0 you\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0to never stop moving once. Though don't run carelessly into the enemy fire! Multiple robot types are trying to end your run\u00a0 with their erratic behaviour, your laser gun is the only option left for you!</p>\r\n\r\nA little bit to playing and controlling Phasearm.\r\n-\r\nThe program supports both keyboard input as well as Xbox 360 and\r\ncompatible controllers. Other third party controller admittedly\r\nwon't work without some workaround. Just a heads up :)\r\n-\r\nKeyboard uses Space/Esc/Arrow Keys as input.\r\n-\r\nEsc pauses the game or quits the game. Holding down Esc when\r\nthe game is paused quits the game.\r\nF3 toggles between Fullscreen/Window", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06a8d88adaa31b98431fb98348f9e754.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shajamaru"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
