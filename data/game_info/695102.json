There are many different obstacles (e.x. normal cubes, tilted cubes, and Ramps.) If you make it to the end of the level and it doesn't move to the next, it's probably because you hit an obstacle right before you made it to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Use the A key to go left, and the D key to slide right. Tip: When moving, don't hold down the movement keys for too long. Try to hold them for as little time as possible, so your moves can be quick, and persist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rember this game is only 50% done, there's still a lot of things left to do.</p>\n<p>Made By, N_at3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T06:39:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b555cbcdf728ca12715b424fd5a4e29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N_at3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
