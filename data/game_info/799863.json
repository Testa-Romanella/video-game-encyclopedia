I generated a small handful and then decided to turn this specific script into a Visual\u00a0Novel<strong>.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I started this project around May 17th and sadly a real life incident meant that I wasn't able to work on this between June 1st and June 7th. This means the project is a lot rougher and less polished than\u00a0I would have liked. I wouldn't mind coming back to this in future to iron out some bugs and add more sound effects.</p>\n<p>Note: Please refresh the page if music doesn't immediately play!
