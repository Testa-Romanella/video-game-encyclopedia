Managing a space station in a distant star system isn\u2019t an easy task to achieve, that\u2019s why you should do your best to attract customers and get them to spend money.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>There are lots of wandering pilots across the whole galaxy looking for a space station</strong>. Each has their reasons, be it to repair and refuel their ships or maybe just to relax and have some fun. Even though what they each look for in a space station is very different, there is one thing they have in common;\u00a0<strong>they want to spend some money.</strong>\u00a0In Space Station Tycoon you will expand your station by building lots of different stuff like docking bays, research facilities, and even casinos to attract every kind of customer you can.</p>\n\n<p>Space Station Tycoon is inspired by its greatest ancestors of the \u201ctycoon\u201d genre. That\u2019s why our main focus while making this game is always going to be its depth.
