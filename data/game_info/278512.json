The city is completely walled off from the outside world, causing time and mindless drones to create destruction and rubble. Entrapped with feral-like robots, you must use the environment and the tools in front of them to upgrade themselves in order to have the strength and ability to find a way out.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unlock deeper and darker secrets that unravel the very catacombs of the city itself. Bigger, smarter, and deadlier robots begin to emerge. Meanwhile, the society outside begins to make contact with the walled in city.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Grayscale</em> fuses the freedom of role-playing games and the immersion of first-person storytelling. Fall into\u00a0the unique challenge of playing as a customizable robot. Craft your own limbs, build your own weapons, and explore a visually rich, once-bustling city, while piecing together a fascinating story of devotion, loss and redemption. Players exchange body and brain components to best suit play styles and game challenges. Modifications can be attached and combined to alter a weapon\u2019s degree of damage, style, and even the physics of its projectile. All of this inside a fascinating and deep story dragging the player into the mysterious, immersive, and emotional world of <em>Grayscale.</em></p>\n<p><strong>DEMO</strong></p>\n<p>Available right now is the current demo of\u00a0<em>Grayscale.</em> The demo is a small snippet of the full game in an attempt to highlight the mood, tone, and style that\u00a0<em>Grayscale</em> will have.
