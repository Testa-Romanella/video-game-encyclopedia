The spin cycle of the washing machine adds a chaotic element that may help or hinder players.</p>\r\nMay the cleanest bubble win!\r\n<strong>DEFAULT CONTROLS:</strong>\n<ul><li>A/Left/J/F - Move Left</li><li>D/Right/L/H - Move Right</li><li>W/Up/I/T - Inflate</li><li>S/Down/K/G - Deflate</li></ul>\n<p>Use the mouse to navigate the main menu.<br/></p>\n<p>Inflating will increase your size and make you float upwards, while deflating will decrease your size and make you fall.</p>\n<p>Collect coins by touching them. The game will end when the timer hits zero.</p>\r\nNOTE: The default controls are\u00a0highly discouraged when playing with three or four players!\u00a0\r\nUnless player three and player four like being smooshed between everyone else. I won't judge. Use controllers for large parties!\r\nALSO NOTE: This is a WIP!!\r\nAs in \"this is nowhere near finished\"! I hope to add more things like better graphics, more accurate bubble physics, an elimination mode, spikes, popping other players, and more!\r\nTRIPLE NOTE: The Mac and Linux versions of the game haven't been tested!\r\nI don't have computers to test on so they might be unstable or broken. :&lt;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06d59351bce807e11626e603b85f26f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slick"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
