You may find the teleporting difficult to handle. So why not give a try?<br/></p>\n<p>        Wizard boy: arrows to move, up to jump, down to interact/talk, hold space bar to attack. If you can't walk on, please try interacting or attacking. <br/></p>\n<p>Devil: arrows to move, hold left/right arrow and release to teleport. Hold the key longer to teleport farther.  M to mute/unmute. <br/></p>\n<p>The game auto saves at each checkpoint. You may fail several times before reaching the next checkpoint. Good luck.    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/490/4904d9d9d167e6f6b056111cf8371d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaseStripe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
