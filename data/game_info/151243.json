Composers and game designers both create the environments, but it is up to a performer or player's navigation of this environment to create the experience.</p>\n<p>In music, though, usually the performer and audience are usually separate entities, with the performer crafting the experience for the audience. In my <em>Nebula Variations</em> the player takes on the role of both performer and audience member, crafting and enjoying a unique musical work in real time.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 12.14.16: Changed to Unity Web GL from outdated Unity Web Player.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e31669ddac65c2c78bede6847222f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Simon Hutchinson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
