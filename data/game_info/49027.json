As your final mission, you ascend to discover its true meaning. All, before the time runs out. <br/><br/>Chromalocity is a first person, speed running platformer built upon finding a balance in the rhythmic mechanics of the game. Making it from start to finish in the best time possible is your aim; your weapon of manipulation, your instinctive reflexes and a dash of ingenuity are key to obtaining top spot. Chromalocity\u2019s simple movement system is coupled with more complex interactions as you progress. These interactions marry together to give the player a rapid and smooth-flowing experience as you traverse a large variety of levels designed to measure your skills and put you to the test as you attempt to best the rest.<br/><br/>As you jump, run, and shoot your ChromaCannon you'll find additional way to interact with your surroundings and the challenges that confront you. Laser obstacles, strange switch targets and gates to pass through will put you in a spin as you try to find the fastest way through the game's levels.About Wrecked Angle StudiosBased in the nurturing home of indie games development in Melbourne, Australia, Wrecked Angle Studios built the game to stand as an entry-point to its three core genres; Shooters, Platformers, and Speedrunning. For many, any of the three genres can create hesitation or straight up aversion. We wanted to develop a game that would act as a player's first steps into those three. Much of the team have come from backgrounds involving these genres and wanted to tackle this task with simplicity and the player's experience in mind. Those new to the genres can slowly work their way through, while veterans of the genres will have a task on their hands to find all the secrets to the levels as, they too, strive to overcome any challenge thrown at them.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d161d16dee4c4d944e818e2de013d977.jpg", "website": "http://www.chromalocity.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wrecked Angle Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wrecked Angle Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
