Also no pixelated version of canvas display).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Worlds &amp; most of the colors are generated randomly, matches are endless and it works best in webkit-like browsers (for some of them like Opera - UDP needs to be enabled in browser settings). Keep in mind that once you press Quick Play - you can be connected to other players, directly.</p>\n<p>It works on mobile too, but I doubt performance and orientation is any good there (and since last update most phones just run out of memory).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>This is a little fun project I work with from time to time. Not sure what, when and if it will become anything more serious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T06:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a2/1a28a33a46942246539249b5f3e4a166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric Gurt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
