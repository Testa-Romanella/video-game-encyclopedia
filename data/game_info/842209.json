However, I had export issues on the day of the deadline, with it being the first time I've used UE5. While I continually struggled to get it exported in the past month, I finally managed to resolve the issues. This game is in the same state it was on the day of the deadline, meaning it would have been what was submitted if UE5 wasn't a jerk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to make a 3D platformer around the given theme of \"The Dice\" to represent someone's gambling addiction. I would have highlighted this around a few things, such as a hub world that represents the character's living room, with everytime he attempts to move into a new room in the house, he has to overcome a level representing a part of his addiction in his head, if I had more time to work on this. However, what's here is merely a prototype to create a character with a\u00a0moveset based around a 3D Platformer, with movement options such as a Wall Jump and Triple Jump, though I'm unsure if I'll ever work on it more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's quite tricky, so I'd recommend a controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ASSET CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player Character</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Suit Icons</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>OST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bottle</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hand</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chips</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dice</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/195bfdcd4ad622ecbcd93d63630d2a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StarscapeDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
