After his tragic passing late last year, it was revealed that Mr. Witters had entrusted the entirety of his estate to the Society. While an extensive legal battle with Mr. Witters\u2019 extended family ensued thereafter, it was ruled that the will would stand, and preparations were made by the Society to receive the donation. Though the full list of items included in this donation has not been made public, some highlights were provided to the Rag. These include: The entirety of Mr. Witters\u2019 personal library, a number of original cuts of his most famous films and shows, and a gallery of art created during his retirement. While historians and film aficionados are clamoring to get their hands on these rare books and films, the Society representative who spoke with us was most excited about the paintings. She described them as \u201cSurreal, paint come to life\u201d and \u201cThe ultimate representation of the tortured artists\u2019 soul.\u201d The exhibit that will house Mr. Witters\u2019 work will be opening in two weeks, on October 20th. Tickets will be made available to the public via the MHS website.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/513d8390b6ac4de6988f0678ae60a891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["GraysonBac"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
