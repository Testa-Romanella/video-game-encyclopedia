You have just to release the water by pressing any key. A game consists in 9 rounds. To score a point, water must fall on the vertical of the bonfire. To release the next waterbomb you have to wait the previous touches the ground.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Waterbomb runs on Sinclair ZX Spectrum and its emulators.
