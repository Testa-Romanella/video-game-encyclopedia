{"id": 832305, "slug": "watch-trader", "name": "Watch Trader", "name_original": "Watch Trader", "description": "<p>Watch Trader is based on Dope Wars, a popular trading game that I used to play as a kid in the 90s. This one is specifically based on v1.2.0 by BeerMat software, the version that I grew up with. The UI also imitates Windows 98 since that's where I played it first.</p>\n<p>In Watch Trader, you don't trade illegal substances. As the name obviously states, you trade something that can also be addictive--watches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this because it's a simple game that I want to play occasionally on my computer or phone. There are several games similar to Dope Wars in the market, but a few have left me satisfied. BeerMat software actually has an official mobile version of Dope Wars, which I recommend you to take a look at. However, this has changed drastically from the simple version I was used to (v1.2.0), so I decided to make my own that I\u00a0can play on my phone or computer.</p>\n<p><strong>TO DO:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Dispose items in briefcase</li><li>Cop encounters</li><li>Hospital and healing\u00a0</li><li>Weapons</li><li>Events (mugging, free stuff)</li><li>Clear local top scores</li><li>Instructions on how to play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/8414c6d53f5ae23d46cd987c7a233fba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["plazatin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
