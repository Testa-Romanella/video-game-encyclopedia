Rushing around the three walls is too crowded and old-fashioned - that's why we threw them away. We present you the Quadranoid: the ball has become completely unbridled and is torn to freedom, like a wild beast! Do not let him leave - after all, the fate of some princess, imprisoned in some high tower under the protection of some dragon, depends on it, we are almost sure of this. Tame the indefatigable energy of the ball and direct its power to the destruction of bricks - but who needs them at all? Break them all - save the world from ... from ... From something, but save! Who else can do this but you?<br/></p>\n<p>* We are not responsible for any consequences that may arise when the bricks are destroyed or the ball runs free.<br/>** In fact, we love Arkanoid. And the last century.</p>\n<p>Now, seriously.<br/>- sensitivity setting of paddles movement for a comfortable game;<br/>- slow-mo effect to prevent ball loss when you exit pause mode;<br/>- inertia with the paddles free movement for better control of the ball when you rearrange your fingers on the touch screen;<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c0e73476a474253672b05530b9ab33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpyFish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
