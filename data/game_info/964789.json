While rushing along the roller coaster track at ludicrous speeds, try to avoid enemies, obstacles and falling off. There are five environments with three stages each, and a boss fight after every third stage. Survive three laps around the track to finish a stage. There is a health bar which depletes when you fall off the track or take hits; falling off with an empty health bar leads to a game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-11T22:07:49", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
