Me! I ...... an ordinary hunter, how could I be chosen by the gods?</p>\r\n\"Just you? How dare you?\"\r\n<p>But why didn't anyone tell me that the White Dragon of this generation is a petite girl?</p>\r\n\"Well ...... instead of killing you, why don't we make some interesting deals.\"\r\n<p>Are you kidding me?</p>\n<p>Interspecies Dependence ...... Crisis of Trust ...... The Test of Genuineness ...... Strength? Survival? Glory? If I could do it all over again ...... I would not choose betrayal ......</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p><strong>Intention:</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, I am committed to storytelling. Some of the choices about betraying the village or betraying the White Dragon actually insinuate the reality of the situation, we should go to believe in a freak who is not accepted by the world but gives true love to us? Or do we believe in the group we belong to without any reason? The game will have a good ending and a bad ending, but in reality, in many cases, we can not meet everyone's expectations, all we can do is follow our own hearts to choose our own destiny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\tWhat about you? If it were you? How would you choose your own destiny?\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI also focused on characterization, and through this story, I hope to bring my character to life. How was her character formed? I hope that the family of origin, lifestyle, and the way she treats others shape the character of the White Dragon, but also hope that players can feel that.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI always believe that imperfection is beauty, as a player, do you feel her imperfection?\r\n</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>\u30105000+\u00a0word storyline\u3011</p>\n<p>\u3010Includeds true ending CG\u3011</p>\n<p>\u30105 complete endings\u3011</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p><strong>Existing endings:</strong></p>\n<p>Bad Ending1: Revelry</p>\n<p>Bad Ending2: Amusement\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bad Ending3: Suspect</p>\n<p>True Ending1: Heroism</p>\n<p>True Ending2: The End of Happiness</p>\n\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p>This game is still in the earliest experimental stage for study usage, if there are problems, please be more tolerant &gt; &lt; Thank you for your patience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T11:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d7101cb455449c72fb36d3c78ad2a46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aulaitmilk"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
