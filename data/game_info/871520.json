This Level would allow the player to test their weapons in a time trial-style obstacle course involving hostage rescue. I would like to further explore the incorporation and use of VR not only from a game perspective but in regard to training software for military and emergency services. Allowing for the safe practice of specific scenarios and communication techniques.\u00a0 The first-person controller and weapons are from the low poly shooter pack v4.3 from the unity asset store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3e3d3bf6dcf8ed32e488d7205e95a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke McCarron"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
