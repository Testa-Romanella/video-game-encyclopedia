Do people around you find it difficult to understand how detrimental a simple conversation can be to your progress? Show them this game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is not so much a game as it is a way to show how important concentration is for those professions that need a high level of focus, especially programmers.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><em>(Play with audio for the best experience.)</em></p>\n<p>You are a programmer working around other people in an office. Your job is to implement features with as few bugs as possible. Your day starts at 9:00 AM and ends at 5:00 PM. At the end of the day, your performance will be judged on the number of features and bugs.</p>\n<p>You are the most productive during \"Flow\" - the maximum level of focus. On the other hand, a low level of focus usually results in a lot of bugs. Your focus level is shown on the meter to the left.</p>\n\r\nDiscord\r\n<p>If you'd like to share your own \"interruption\" story, or if have any suggestions or feedback, or you just want to talk, come over to the Discord Server.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nDevelopment notes\r\n<ul><li>Current version:<strong> v0.2.0</strong></li><li>Development status: <strong>In progress / Looking for feedback</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The game is a solo effort by one programmer - me. Evidently, it could do with a lot more polish in terms of... well, everything. Feel free to criticize.</p>\n<p>In the meantime,\u00a0here is a roadmap of things I may or may not eventually get around to doing:</p>\n<ul><li>Theme music</li><li>Rework audio to be WebGL compatible</li><li>More conversations (so you don't get the same ones every time)</li><li>Office environment graphics</li><li>Better UI design</li><li>Moar visual effects</li><li>Custom conversations</li></ul>\n\r\nA note on HTML5 build\r\n<p>Due to certain limitations, Unity cannot use FMOD internally for audio in its WebGL builds as it does on other platforms. This limits the audio functionalities of WebGL builds. The game relies on some of these functionalities to build its atmosphere and will therefore not have a WebGL build that can run directly from the browser.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>This comic by Monkey User for the inspiration</li><li>Unruly Games for the free 2000+ Faces asset</li><li>Vertex Studio for the\u00a0Absolutely Free Music\u00a0asset</li><li>CC0 audio contributors at freesound.org</li><li>Astigmatic for Luckiest Guy font on Google Fonts</li><li>Neale Davidson for Comic Book font on fontriver.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649ed2edad4c734c56c1f0beb9498a96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Vanlal Hriata"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
