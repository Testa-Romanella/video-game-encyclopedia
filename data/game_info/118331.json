Based on a conversation on the Crate and Crowbar podcast.</p><p>Each eye will be controlled by one of your Vive controllers.  Hold them up to your head, so the holes in the controllers become your eyes. (Keep them so that the vive logo and touchpad is facing up, and hold them like binoculars. The USB charging port will be the direction you're looking.) . Move each controller one at a time, with one eye open, to make sure you have the correct eye in each hand.  </p><p>Try pointing them both in the same direction and lining them up.  Try looking behind your back.  Have fun.</p><p>There's also a video demo that I've told works in Google Cardboard, for people without a Vive.<br/></p><p>For updates on my latest projects, follow me on Twitter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5b7583ccd305da7e83fecaa494a50a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CJKinni"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
