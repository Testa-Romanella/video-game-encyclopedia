{"id": 836451, "slug": "bloody-hell-hotel", "name": "Bloody Hell Hotel", "name_original": "Bloody Hell Hotel", "description": "<p>In Bloody Hell Hotel, you embody a vampire. You wake up from a coma that has lasted for centuries, only to find your once-grand estate is now in ruins. It&#39;s time to turn it into a prosperous hotel! It&#39;s no easy task, though, as times are tough and resources are scarce. There are shortages of food, supplies, and workforce. Being a blood-thirsty monster doesn&#39;t help with customer satisfaction either. Luckily, underneath the estate lies a crypt and a system of caves. By foraging, farming, crafting, and fighting your way through the monster-infested dungeons, you&#39;ll find the resources you need to restore greatness to your mansion and turn it into a thriving hotel business.</p>\n<p>Fix broken furniture, clean rooms, hang wallpaper, install appliances, and make your once-grand estate look presentable. Don&#39;t forget to use your vampiric powers to speed up the process!</p>\n<p>Upgrade, decorate, and furnish your hotel. Make it your own!</p>\n<p>Meet the expectations of even the most demanding guests. Or don&#39;t! You&#39;re a vampire, after all. Suck your guests&#39; blood to regenerate your powers and use their meat to save money on food.</p>\n<p>Your guests expect high-quality room service. While ingredients are costly, you can farm, milk the undead cow, collect eggs from zombie chickens, and find wild mushrooms that grow around your hotel. Oh, and when it comes to meat, nobody has to know where it comes from. Follow recipes and prepare even the most extravagant dishes for your guests.</p>\n<p>Those dungeons below aren&#39;t going to explore themselves. Be careful when stepping into these corridors - you might need a good sword to defeat the monsters that hide in the darkness. Luckily, you can make your weapons from scratch. All you need is a blacksmith\u2019s workshop, a set of tools, and a handful of raw materials. Conveniently, they&#39;re located right underneath the hotel&#39;s lobby.</p>\n<p>Now that you&#39;re armed to the teeth with self-made weapons, you&#39;re ready to explore the dungeons. They hide many resources that you will need to unlock countless upgrades to your hotel.</p>\n<p>Once your hotel grows in size, you will be able to hire employees, your fellow vampires. You might need a cook, a housekeeper, a porter, a receptionist... Whatever task you want to delegate, you can find someone to do it for you. All it takes is good cashflow and a bit of blood to entice them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2022-08-19T07:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f18f806043cb8bc8f36ee052e8bf2d12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "toplay": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 517, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unfold Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Unfold Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
