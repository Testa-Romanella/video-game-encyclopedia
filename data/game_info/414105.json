You may stack several actions and drag your mouse to select multiple tiles. When locusts come, spray them with insecticide before they can eat and reproduce.</p>\n<p>The soil will gradually dry. Crop doesn't grow on dry land and twice as fast when well hydrated, so water regularly! You can launch a weather rocket to make it rain, but there is a chance to get an acid rain instead, that will damage your crop and kill locusts.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Code:<br/>Yogoda</p>\n<p>Art:<br/>Astadriel</p>\n<p>Tester:<br/>Rakshir</p>\n<p>Music by Eric Matyas<br/>\"Machine-Madness\"<br/>www.soundimage.org</p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/>cydon: Rocket shoot 002.wav<br/>n-audioman: drone-take-off-01.wav (https://freesound.org/)<br/>gynation: rain-on-plastic-roof.wav (https://freesound.org/)<br/>rtb45: mount-moganshan-insect-chorus.wav (https://freesound.org/)<br/>jrssandoval: shower.wav (https://freesound.org/)</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the repository for those that are curious how it's done:</p>\n<p><strong>https://github.com/Yogoda/GodotWildJam18</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea97a600bb63929a35998c27703fecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["joel127"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
