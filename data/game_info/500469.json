But it's not enough to hook the fish -- in this competition, you <strong><em>must leap from your boat and take on the fish in their realm, within a sea of blood!</em></strong></p>\n<p>- 16 rounds featuring a different breed of horrific sea creature<br/>- Upgrade your gear to gain the advantage when in battle<br/>- Explore the seafloor and recover relics from the depths<br/>- Mingle with rival damned souls in order to learn their secret techniques<br/>- Unlock advantages against your foes by studying them with a research camera<br/>- Accumulate different SCALES cut from your enemies in battle to CRAFT PERKS<br/>-Featuring optional in-game radio featuring macabre hits, hosted by the undead DJ Shriekz!</p>\n<p>\u00a0SOUNDTRACK Free here:</p>\n<p>- If you are sitting around waiting for a bite like REAL fishing -- <strong><em>you are playing like a chump </em></strong>( and will be doing so for a while before anything happens ). <em>Use the bait cam</em>, it makes catching fish a breeze!</p>\n<p>- Understand the game uses 3D models, however the game is<strong> LOCKED ONTO A 2D PLANE </strong>( Think 2.5D, or \"still 2D, but you can swing the camera around ). Understanding this is KEY to getting the hang of the controls, and it's confusing to a lot of people at first.</p>\n<p>- As the rounds progress, the fish will become stronger and more aggressive/powerful. It is wise to upgrade your character before moving along the rounds -- it will be harder later</p>\n<p>- Fish at later rounds are only found at deeper depths -- upgrade the line to reach them.</p>\n<p>- Certain fish only like certain bait. You should purchase the research cam and aim it at the fish to collect data on them to find out what they eat!</p>\n<p>- The statues retain collected data retrieved from doing research on FISH! The more research you do, the more SECRET ADVANTAGES you will gain!</p>\n<p>- You do not have to have a fish on the line to grab them -- in fact grabbing them in a free dive allows for the ability to stab them into chunks and collect more scales and chum :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64945598ddad9ab74e19763ed448358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuitsnNukes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
