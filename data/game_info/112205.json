Basically, my grand RPG Maker MV project that was born of randomness and boredom.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>[Summary]</p>\n<p>In the wake of a terrible war, a parallel world is led by groups of what we know as YouTubers (i.e. Markiplier, Vanoss, etc).\u00a0 There are two major factions: The Achievement Alliance sticks fast to the medieval world that once was, while the Moon Owl Syndicate pushes for modern progress and technology.\u00a0 A dispute over whose methods are better for the world in the distant future has sparked an erratic war, fought by both remnants of the old world and their descendants.</p>\n<p>But an outside faction threatens this surprisingly post-apocalyptic realm, targeting both sides of a world war in progress in a bid to take everything for themselves.\u00a0 What better way to deal with an outside threat than with an outside solution in the form of a group of adventurers who happen to stumble upon what is seemingly a random group of mercenaries in a ruined tower of days long gone?</p>\n<p>Take control of original character Selesca Auleokas and her friends as they get involved in a war that threatens not just their world, but possibly others as well, including that which lies beyond the fourth wall!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Any and all help and suggestions are appreciated!  Also looking for spriters willing to work with MV's default chibi style sprites!</p>\n<p>If anything out of the ordinary that seems like it shouldn't be happening pops up, let me know in the comments, or via tumblr here:\u00a0http://zergvsgenin.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>Previous game version: Rhajat</p>\n<p>Current game version: Uzuki</p>\n<p>NOTE: The current version of the game SHOULD be the bottom-most one.\u00a0 Also, quick note, version Severa of the game will go away after the release of the next version after Uzuki!\u00a0 It's an older version of the game, to be sure, but just letting you know in case of whatever.</p>\n<p>NOTE for version Rhajat:\u00a0I accidentally neglected to rename the folder, so it will show up as WIP when you download the file.\u00a0 But do know that that is the main game, so you can rename the folder as you please after unzipping it.</p>\n<p>[Features Worth Mentioning]</p>\n<ul><li>OCs at the forefront of the story!</li><li>Voice clips of various moments!</li><li>Cameos, playable appearances by, and battles against various YouTubers and Rooster Teeth crew members!</li><li>Lack of PewDiePie!</li><li>Loving nods of varying degrees to Super Robot Wars!</li><li>Guest character appearances that actually play into the main plot!</li><li>Placeholder animations and graphics!</li><li>Because the game was/is made in RPG Maker MV, no RTP is required!\u00a0 Just DL and open the app!</li></ul>\n<p>[Standalone Gaiden Stories]</p>\n<ol><li>A Paralogue Between Girls: https://zergvsgenin.itch.io/a-paralogue-between-girls-youtube-fates-paralogue-ga...</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7c/a7cecd069b9437328053a9294506c962.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zergvsgenin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
