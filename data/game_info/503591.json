Your goal is to get as many asteroids and UFOs stuck\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0loop\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0Earth\u00a0as\u00a0possible.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have a space station, which is orbiting the planet. The space station has tractor beams, which you can use to push and pull the asteroids.<br/></p>\n<p>To collect an asteroid, you need to pull/push it until it's in orbit within the green circle around the earth. If it stays within the green area for long enough, you'll get points according to its mass.</p>\n<p>You should try to avoid hitting the earth with an asteroid, because if you do it'll do damage, and if you do it too much the Earth might even be destroyed.<br/></p>\n<p>Occasionally you'll see UFOs. You can collect them the same way you get asteroids, but you can also just ram them into the earth (they won't do damage). For each one you collect, your tractor beams get a bit stronger.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, try to influence an object's orbit from the opposite side. For example, if the low point of an asteroid's orbit is within the green area, but the high point is too far away, don't push it towards the earth when it's at the top. Instead, you should try to slow it down when its at the low point, because then it won't be able to go as high.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li>Push Object - Left Click, or Z if you're using a mousepad</li><li>Pull Object - Right Click, or X if you're using a mousepad</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:12:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca0683dfe5162c91438a5af2a78b02f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jcourt325"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
