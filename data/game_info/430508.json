Race through a variety of environments against ruthless computer opponents, and prove your driving skills once and for all against the infamous rubber-banding AI. If solo gaming isn't your thing, why not break a few friendships with our multiplayer modes? Race or battle against up to three of your soon-to-be enemies, and enjoy some banging tunes by musical artist Saury!<br/><br/>Still not satisfied? Maybe you should try calling a plumber.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T16:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a43a4e582a70e9b5c75b5d1ff130f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["geostegma"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Geostegma"], "esrb_rating": null}
