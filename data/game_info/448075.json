It shouldn't be, unless... you can't read the names on the graves! Try to find the correct graves to dig with your partner in crime trying his best to describe their locations while avoiding the angry spirits. <br/></p>\n<p>The theme of this game was \"You're the enemy.\" Grave diggers are technically enemies of the dead right?</p>\n<p>I made this game with Unreal Engine  using primarily c++. The 3D models and animations were created using Blender. Audio clips were taken from online.</p>\n<p>This is a fairly short game that can be completed in 10-20 minutes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a11f751f4874576942bedb8f72ed6f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ManzorS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
