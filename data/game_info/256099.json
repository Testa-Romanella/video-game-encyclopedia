Match them to the same color 2x bonus ball for even more points. Special balls help when you are in a jam.  Finger pads on the left and right side of the screen allow you to rotate balls around the center point.<br/> <br/>Using both fingers you can actually throw balls off of the center point but watch out! If a ball strikes the outer edge its all over.<br/><br/>Customizable backgrounds, music, borders, and text allow you to choose how the game looks and sounds.  <br/><br/>Five different modes of play include Clockwise, Random, Cross-Fire, Multi-Ball, and Rapid Fire.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f9d4a0ad2198617d782d04fabbb0a8d_5oge9LL.jpg", "website": "http://www.peculiarsoftworks.com/spinoffinfo.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Brian J.
