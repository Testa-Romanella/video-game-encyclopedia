In the game you play as a fire creature that must light fires to advance in the level or you will turn to ash. Your Goal is to collect coins and find the exit door with as little deaths as possible.\u00a0 Used the jam to really focus on my asset pipeline and getting models that fit together well done quickly :) hope you enjoy. its a nice short game features leaderboards if you finish.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65b71b387d79a4d8c9bd33275c9d3eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VolkillerGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
