You are this boss and you have to escape, for this you will have to create a bug in your dungeon. However, pay attention to don\u2019t get killed by the players who are coming to fight you, because they will probably report the bug and destroy your only way to escape. After each fight, you have a break, take advantage of it to bug the game.\r\nEnjoy !\r\n<p><strong>Credits :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programmers :<ul><li>BERNARD Geoffrey</li><li>DUFOSSE R\u00e9mi</li></ul></li><li>Designers :<ul><li>AHOND Martin</li><li>DEBUIRE Mathis</li><li>PICARD Thomas</li></ul></li><li>Music :<ul><li>AHOND Martin</li></ul></li><li>Standarding :<ul><li>Samuel</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17e/17e0a10798ef8ba2783f7dbc75aa03fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["La debrouille"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
