You have to retrieve the ball again if you wanna be able to attack! That said though, it is possible to finish the game without attacking at all...</p><p>The game is only one stage long as well, I'd have made another stage, but I ran out of time, so a single stage will have to do...<br/></p><p>I know the focus of the Jam was more so in design and originality, but I really wanted to push myself to make a game with the best and most accurate\u00a016 bit\u00a0presentation possible given the time constraints! With that in mind,\u00a0I don't necessarily expect my game to do exceptionally well with the judges, but I do hope you'll enjoy what you'll see, hear and play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b549a10a27fb530da705809800c36e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michirin9801"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
