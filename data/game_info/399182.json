Place down the fence/coop at the start of the game so the chickens get a place to rest later.\r\n\r\n2. Once you placed the fence and set the play area, you will see chickens around you, chase them into the coop!\r\n\n\r\n3. Of course the chickens will run away from you, so make sure to get up on your feet and move behind them until they are where you want them to be.\r\n\r\n4. Once the chicken is inside the coop, make sure to close the door behind you before you start chasing your next target so those within the coop would not escape.\u00a0\r\n\r\n5. The game is recommanded to be play within a open space.
