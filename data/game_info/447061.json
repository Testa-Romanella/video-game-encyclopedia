This is a short puzzle-platformer with a cool room-warping mechanic. Set in a space-base, who will you trust once you get to the end?</p>\n<p>This is my second game fully made, I have been using game dev to learn programming. This was a really fun project, everyday the game seemed drastically\u00a0different\u00a0from the last.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The player runs and jumps through 9 levels designed to make the player familiar with the room-warping mechanic. Collect all the keys in the level to unlock the portal to carry you forward. Make it from platform to platform above dangerous red spikes, and think about your environment!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The player's movement can be controlled with A &amp;\u00a0D or the arrow keys, and you can jump by either using the W key, the up arrow, the Z key, or the space bar.</p>\n<p>Full screen mode\u00a0can be toggled by the F key.</p>\n<p>There is a debugging mode which I have decided to leave in so\u00a0you can play with it if you are interested, if not, ignore the next part of this description and enjoy the game! Thanks!</p>\n<ul><li>P key toggles debug mode</li><li>G key restarts game</li><li>R key restarts level</li><li>Number brings you to specified level (0 being main menu)</li><li>O key spawns particle emitter</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read about my project!
