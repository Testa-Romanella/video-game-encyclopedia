Solve X bite-sized levels inspired by puzzle classics like Chip's Challenge and Sokoban, or make and share your own levels with an intuitive map editor and full workshop support.  Levels can even be copied and shared as a simple text string!  <br/><br/>Enemies and their projectiles only move when you move and levels are filled with a variety of hazards.  Use smart planning to outmaneuver and eliminate cultists with classic weapons like the shotgun, riveter, crossbow, and the all powerful soap.  Use movable barrels and other explosives to blast through walls.  Zip around on conveyor belts to quickly reposition.  Dodge bullets with the inhuman skill and agility only possible through turn-based movement.
