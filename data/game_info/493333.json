Can take that off the bucket list.</strong></p>\n<p>What is Pixel Mural RPG 2b2t? Well, it's a Metroidvania-RPG combo that definitely fails to check boxes in both of those categories. It was originally made for GB Jam 8, and due to the presence of a time limit I didn't get to implement all of my grand ambitions for the game---but hey, that's life, amirite?</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's basically just a small game where you get to explore an ancient Egyptian mural in 4 colors, fight some really tough* bosses, and find some hidden Easter eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>And yes, Pixel Mural RPG 2b2t is fully playable on GBC emulators.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Also -- super big shoutout to Taylor Kirkwood (https://itch.io/profile/tkirkwood9) for composing the soundtrack for this game! He wrote 8 fully-fledged chiptune .MOD songs along with 4 shorter jingles in like 3 days, so kudos to him. Make sure to follow him!</p>\n<p>Pixel Mural RPG 2b2t was made in GBStudio 2 Open Beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A - Throw Spear</li><li>B - Jump</li><li>D-Pad - Move Around</li><li>Start - View Map</li></ul>\n<p>On PC/Mac, the Gameboy controls are mapped to the following keys:</p>\n<ul><li>\"A\" - Z</li><li>\"B\" - X</li><li>\"D-Pad\" - Arrow Keys</li><li>\"Start\" - Enter</li></ul>\n\n<p>* \"tough\" as used here is subjective and depends upon the player</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aaf943c5b46e771bfbe6076f5b918709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cormorant42"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
