By picking letters from a randomized grid, the player can form words that are associated with different actions like attacking, increasing defense and debuffing enemies. The more complex the word is, the greater its effects are. After the timer runs out, each word is counted and its effects resolved automatically until the player loses the game or defeats the enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c215cf8e2ae884c12023e306a37ec824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pi0h1", "JuanCastano", "Arkadius_27", "sofi_luna", "Flair_Time"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
