Jack is pulled into a dangerous mystery when a handful of Baron Fossville's mercenaries begin hunting him. From Grubber's Market through Commerce Street, and onto Lord's Keep; Jack is faced with numerous challenges. Teisha lends a hand along the way, as does Bobby, the mysterious boy always lurking in Lord's Market. The ladies at Maiden House are helpful, but can sometimes be a bit overbearing. The shopkeepers are always willing to chat about the latest gossip. Jack, he just wants to sit down and eat an apple.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30dc69f53e63b63a76e7f6010ba0cf24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Textfyre"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
