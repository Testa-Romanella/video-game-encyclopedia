{"id": 552182, "slug": "seoul", "name": "Seoul", "name_original": "Seoul", "description": "<p>Seoul is a One Life, Multi-Soul 2.5D Puzzle Dungeon Escape game made for the\u00a0Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The objective of the game is to escape a large expansive dungeon that you've mysteriously been placed in. The problem is, anything will kill you. If anything touches you, it's over, and you have to start over from the beginning.. Thankfully, through powers unknown, you are able to split your soul in half. Doing so gives you another chance at life in case you meet your untimely demise. If you do die while split, your left over soul acts as a \"checkpoint\" to keep your progress. If you manage to escape the dungeon, at what cost to yourself did you do it for, how much of YOU is left...</p>\n\n<p>Update #1:</p>\n<p>Seoul is FAR from done, I managed to try my best to complete the game in the week but due to other priorities and obstacles, I didn't get it to where I wanted it. I had a lot of fun trying out 2.5D for the first time as well as making all the assets myself. I plan on continuing the development of the game in the future to see its true potential. I hope you like the VERY ROUGH demo. Any feedback or ideas is greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\"WASD\" - To Move</p>\n<p>\"SPACEBAR\" - To Jump</p>\n<p>\"R\" - To Split your Soul</p>\n\n\n<p>** DISCLAMER**</p>\n<p>The game is not finished in any way, shape, or form.
