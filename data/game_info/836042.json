It's just regular golf but small!</p>\n<p>This is a game developed for the LowRezJam\u00a0of\u00a02022 in about 4-5 days. It was fun to try and force unity into working with a resolution like this, and I hope the result is worth your time. The music is also made by me, though I'm a complete beginner at it, so there is a mute button included below just in case.<br/></p>\n<p>The game itself just has a single level, but different sections are locked behind fruit power-ups that grant different abilities. My best run (after update) took 31 strokes. I\u00a0think\u00a0theoretically\u00a0a perfect run\u00a0might be 20 strokes.</p>\n<p>Feel free to post screenshots of your score at the end, I used a font that was only 3 pixels high so if it's unreadable I'll decipher it for you lol</p>\n<ul><li>The M key mutes the music, there isn't a controller input for this.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls (Keyboard):</p>\n<ul><li>WS/\u2191\u2193 :\u00a0Increase/Decrease the power of your shot.</li><li>AD/\u2190\u2192: Change the angle of your shot.</li><li>Space: Hit the ball.</li><li>R: Reset to a hardcoded safepoint (failsafe for getting stuck, adds a stroke and changes location after each power-up).</li><li>T: Factory Reset, kinda like refreshing the page.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls (Gamepad): This might get weird cause I used unity's old input system.</p>\n<ul><li>Dpad Up/Down: \u00a0Increase/Decrease the power of your shot.</li><li>Dpad Left/Right: Change the angle of your shot.</li><li>South Face Button(A on xbox): Hit the Ball.</li><li>East Face Button(B on xbox): Reset to a hardcoded safepoint (failsafe for getting stuck, adds a stroke and changes location after each power-up).</li><li>Start or Select: Factory Reset, like refreshing the page.</li></ul>\n<p>v(<strong>Spoilers?</strong>)v<br/></p>\n<p>Power-up Guide (<strong>Spoilers!</strong>):<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The first berry opens the level and allows you to use the cannon.</li><li>The second berry allows you to stick to surfaces.</li><li>The third berry allows you to traverse water.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T11:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7528bf37e2fe56f38962d42e4b29b0b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Shoelariat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
