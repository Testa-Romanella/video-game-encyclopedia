The idea of having a day/night cycle was thought of early on - having a vampire running about in the daytime just didn't seem right. \u00a0Also having Vlad hide behind objects like the post box was to be implemented - and was at one point! \u00a0 The goblet with the blood was to be the health indicator - as you lost health it would drain, and refill when you fed on people.\u00a0\u00a0You can see in the top screenshot the guy in the grey suit staring at his watch. \u00a0People were going to do random things (stop to look at their watch/phone, tie their shoelaces) but that's a lot of art to draw and makes more issues when you are trying to relearn how to draw.\u00a0\u00a0The bat was to be a familiar, and could send it out to kill people when yo were hiding.\r\n<p>The next thing was to figure out how to make a game. \u00a0And also figure out which engine to use. \u00a0Unreal was out of the question - I don't need 3D, and Unity seemed a little too complicated. \u00a0GameMaker was my engine of choice. \u00a0It specializes in 2D and seemed to be the easiest engine to learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Youtube is awesome for learning. \u00a0</strong>If you want to learn how to code in any language Youtube is a great place to start. \u00a0Shaun Spalding has a great selection of videos to help you code in GameMaker, so a big thanks to Shaun and his videos.</p>\n<p><strong>THE PROTOTYPES</strong></p>\n<p>V1:</p>\n<p>I had managed to get Vlad in, control him with the arrow keys and become blocked by collision objects and move between rooms!</p>\n<p>V2 - V4:<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Basically the same layout as the first. \u00a0Added a dark filter and basic lighting to get the nighttime effect. \u00a0People were added as well, but coding AI at this point was not going to happen, so I just made them walk from left to right. \u00a0They would not go into the different screens - every screen is a room in gamemaker, and every room is treated as a level, and this is the one thing that ended up being the biggest time sink by the time the game became Beta. \u00a0But more on that later...</p>\n<p><strong>THE ALPHAS</strong></p>\n<p>V1:</p>\n<p>Now we're starting to get serious! \u00a0The title screen is in with a natty curtain. \u00a0The basic hud is now in with a working health / mana bar, and the time display works (with a moon and smiley faced sun!). \u00a0 The idea of having a score system was in, 100 points for every death, and you were able to attack people with a sword! \u00a0Also ZOMBIES!!! \u00a0The lighting system is looking a lot better than the prototypes as it uses a different shader engine. \u00a0The moon in the background was going to be used as well, but I was unable to figure out a way to make the light work properly with it, so it was scrapped early on. \u00a0 The areas included are a park (where you start when the ferryman brings you over to the mainland), a housing estate, a town area with sewer access (the sewers are broken - going through doors leads to the wrong point in the next room), the graveyard with zombies and forest.</p>\n<p>People walking about is now in the game, but it's not in any way perfect.</p>\n<p>Like I said earlier, every screen is a room, and gamemaker treats every room as a level. \u00a0People had to have their own array in order to store and manipulate their coordinates and also the room they are in. \u00a0So in order to get people walking about, you have to add a certain amount to the objects X/Y position. \u00a0Once the object gets to a certain X position, destroy the object and change the room they exist in in their array. \u00a0It was very complicated and it was a silly thing to do looking back.<br/></p>\n<p>So things are getting better, but the layout was annoying me...</p>\n<p>V2:</p>\n\n<p>More things added. \u00a0The score system was scrapped as it served no real purpose. \u00a0The layout of the castle had changed a little bit as well, graphics being the main thing to be changed. \u00a0Starting to work with dialogue boxes as well. \u00a0A few extra screen were added and changed, the bridge being one of the main ones with a troll that would not let you passed until you get a goat that was to be freed from the cult followers.<br/></p>\n<p>There was also the idea that you could convince people to let you into their homes and you would have to find an object or kill someone to get an object, but the view would be in a 2D platformer view.</p>\n<p>V3:</p>\n<p>The layout is being changed as this point, and would be the basis for the final layout for the BETA and final version. \u00a0Graphics were updated / changed and then things took a turn for the worse...</p>\n<p>One thing people don't really hear about is the mental issues that can affect you when you are doing this sort of thing 24/7. \u00a0My mind had turned into swiss cheese by this point, and I had to take time off from developing. \u00a0It was almost a year before I went near the game again as the thought of working on this any longer was making things worse for me. \u00a0But I kept looking at it from time to time, and had it in my mind that I had gone this far and that I was going to finish this one way or another.</p>\n<p><strong>THE BETA</strong></p>\n<p>So my head was less melted at this point, so I decided to get back to work and get this finished.</p>\n<p>This was supposed to be the final version, and I'm glad it wasn't. \u00a0Music has been added and the layout is completely different to the previous versions, but there were a few big issues. \u00a0There was no save (I had no intention of putting a save system in to begin with but people wanted it in) and the other big problem was the people AI. \u00a0This version still has every screen being its own level in Gamemaker. \u00a0It can be completed, but after looking at it I decided that I was going to give it one last go and overhaul the map. \u00a0In the final version the town is one level, which it should have been at the very start and would have been less of a headache. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE FINAL VERSION</strong></p>\n<p>So as I've said the entire map required to be stripped out and remade. \u00a0The castle and the town are now on their own separate levels. \u00a0This meant I could use Gamemakers built-in path finding to make people walk around. \u00a0The entire games code is now a lot lighter and the size in general is a lot smaller. \u00a0The versions leading up to this had each graphic blown up from a 16x16 tile to an 80x80 tile and the room being the size of view. \u00a0Now each 16x16 tile is the original size and the view is now scaled properly, meaning that all the graphics now fit onto one texture page and reducing memory use. \u00a0It was stupid to have the graphics at that high resolution to begin with, but at least it was a learning experience. \u00a0A full soundtrack has now been implemented and sound effects. \u00a0I changed the music a little and up-ed the pitch on the main theme and added an extra instrument.</p>\n<p>The game had a good number of bugs fixed\u00a0since the initial release of the full game, and a save system and controller support added along with more music dotted around the map. \u00a0Afterwards I decided to add an arcade mode (Eat-Em-Up) where the goal was to stay alive and eat as may people as you can to get a high score. \u00a0Gold, money and diamonds appear at random as bonuses for the player.</p>\n<p>Once that was implemented I decided to add a new quest to extend the lifespan of the game. \u00a0The goal of the original was to obtain your belongings from the townspeople. \u00a0The second quest is to steal the gold from the next town over, which only took around 5 months to implement. \u00a0Not bad considering how long was spent on the original.</p>\n<p>And so there it is. Approximately 3 years in the making. \u00a0From not knowing a thing about making a game to a full game on sale on Steam, Itch.io, Gamejolt and Greenmangaming. \u00a0Now that it's finished I am going to start thinking about the sequel, which I want to be everything that I wanted to have in the game from the very start. \u00a0There is absolutely no way\u00a0I am going to do this all on my own again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2ddd11850e17dbdd963e775410de9e5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blowfelt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
