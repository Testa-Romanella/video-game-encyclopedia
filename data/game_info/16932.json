{"id": 16932, "slug": "talisman-prologue-2", "name": "Talisman: Prologue", "name_original": "Talisman: Prologue", "description": "<p>Talisman: Prologue is a video game adaptation of Talisman, a popular board game created in 1983 by Games Workshop. This version is adapted for a single-player experience and does not allow multiplayer. The game is set in a high fantasy world of elves and dwarves and was described as &quot;Monopoly meets Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The game is based on the Fourth Edition rules of the original board game. In Talisman, the player controls a single character and moves him or her across a map. There are ten characters, such as Assassin, Monk, or Elf. Each of them has a score of D&amp;D-like abilities, such as Strength and Craft, as well as downsides. </p>\n<p>Each character has his or her set of consecutive scenarios that become longer and more difficult over time. The scenarios are sorted depending on the number of turns required to complete them. The player can set a record by beating a scenario in fewer turns.</p>\n<h3>Maps and movement</h3>\n<p>Each map is divided into three realms that form concentric rings. The player starts at the outer realm and has to defeat guardians or build bridges and rafts to move inwards. The goal is to reach the center of the map, where lies the ancient artifact called The Crown of Command. </p>\n<p>The character&#39;s movement depends on the dice rolls and the properties of the terrain he or she is on. In certain spaces, the protagonist may encounter NPCs, recruit followers, fight enemies, obtain artifacts, and perform other activities. All of them are represented by the cards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60ef1b1853c35da13bc2ca9cbd1c0539.jpeg", "website": "http://www.nomadgames.co.uk", "rating": 1.73, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 875, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Nomad Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Board Games", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nomad Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
