The demonic threat seems to have been forgotten, but the demons return, and there are new accidents around the world. Nero and Dante have parted ways, and Nero established his own agency. He also received a new robotic arm made by his engineer Nico. It replaces his Devil Bringer prosthetic that was stolen by a villain. At the beginning of the game, Nero rides his van to Red Grave City in which a demonic tree appeared. At the same time, Dante has a new client, a mysterious V, who hires him to investigate the demonic attacks.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As usual in the Devil May Cry series, the player controls his or her character from the third person view.

Nero also uses his legendary weapons, the gun called \u201cBlue Rose\u201d and the sword named \u201cRed Queen\u201d. Dante, as usual, fights with his swords Rebellion and Sparda, as well as a variety of new weapons, such as chainsaws and a motorcycle.
