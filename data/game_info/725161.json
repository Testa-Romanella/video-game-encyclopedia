The entire thing takes only about 5-10 minutes to play through but everything you see and hear is\u00a0(mostly) designed and built from scratch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Secondly, yes this is basically a love letter to Mos Eisley.</p>\n<p>The idea was to build a single level in UE4 while using as many different pieces of the engine as possible such as\u00a0blueprints, animated textures, sequences, UI, materials,\u00a0etc, etc.\u00a0Additionally, it doubled as a way to improve on level design by using points of interest, a sense of scale, world-building, and generally guiding the player to their end goal while not bombarding them with popups.</p>\n<p>It's only a wee experience but some of you out there might appreciate it and who knows what it could lead to later down the line! Although small (heh), there was a lot of encouragement and endless enthusiasm tied into this project, thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e3c8d102f1365650202f6139ad6b209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BritSlav Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
