You accept and enter the forest, but it's not what you expect.</p>\n<p>##Controls</p>\n<p>E - interact</p>\n<p>WASD - to move around</p>\n<p>Left click - shoot</p>\n<p>Space - To continue text</p>\n\n<p>##Disclaimer</p>\n<p>There is one glitch in the game where you lose some control of the movement. I'm very sorry for the problems it may cause you but in the short time this game was made in it was unavoidable. From my knowledge to avoid the movement glitch avoid running into environment pieces like fences and npc's.</p>\n<p>There is also a problem in the final screen where the actual dialogue does not appear. The cut scene will still play out but there won't be any dialogue, I am very sorry for this.</p>\n<p>##About Creator</p>\n<p>This is my third game jam and my 4th game. I'm a thirteen year old developer who has been making games for around a year now. I really hope you enjoy my game for the BenBonk game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c3ea38d3d2b97a331029570afc3a512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xd SilentStorm"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
