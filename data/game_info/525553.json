Or kill enough enemy NPCs or players to reduce the camp's resources to 0 to win.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has single person challenge, has the custom multi person to fight. There is also a dedicated server mode. At present, it is a better choice to practice alone or find your friends to play online. What a few friends can play is not as lively as many people.<br/>\r\nSince there may not be many people at the beginning, I only use the server for testing, and I am not very good at server maintenance. In the next step, I will focus on this issue according to the situation.<br/>\r\nFriends play words also have benefits, we all know, can avoid hanging. The fun of this game is to hide the thrill, to see who can hide, open the word is actually only boring, and kill a lot of people, there is no special reward.<br/>\r\nIf online, it is recommended to use friend game mode, but this does not support joining midway. Can also be public games, others should be able to search, including: LAN or public network. However, it may be difficult to use the public network mode in China. Steam should not allow it by default.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat should be noted:<br/>\r\nIt is strongly recommended that you start with the difficulty of single person. If the difficulty is too big, it will be very painful,<br/>\r\nThe more players, the more NPC, the greater the host pressure. If you make a host sense card, you can choose a smaller number of NPCs at the beginning of the game,<br/>\r\nNote that flash bombs are useless for NPC. Smoke bombs are useful<br/>\r\nThe relationship between gun damage and distance is very obvious, so don't use the nozzle to shoot at a long distance, the lethality is very small,<br/>\r\nWhen laying mines, they should be aimed at the ground, not at other places,<br/>\r\nSome of the fires on the ground are just visual effects, which are harmless,<br/>\r\nThe NPC of the simulation player will only rush forward along the road with a stuffy head. It will not open the flag or destroy the base. It is up to you,<br/>\r\nThe simulation player's NPC will not come to rescue you, even if you are under his feet, don't expect too much from them,<br/>\r\nBe careful when using rockets on your stomach, or you will blow yourself up,<br/>\r\nTanks are not suitable for fighting in this map. Choose carefully<br/>\r\nDon't change your posture many times in the pipe and narrow place, which will cause you to get stuck and fall out of the map. If you change your posture carelessly or too tight, you may be able to change your posture in time (such as lying down),<br/>\r\nIf you have a keen sense of hearing, you will find that many sounds are used repeatedly because no suitable resources have been found,<br/>\r\nTry not to have strange ideas and do some strange things. There are still many bugs, which will be improved continuously,<br/>\r\nAt night, the number of frames may decrease significantly, because the dynamic lights used by street lamps greatly test the performance of the video card,<br/>\r\nWhen online, the loading time is more than 2 minutes. It should be a server connection problem. It is recommended to restart the game, provided that your machine is not too bad,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game has just started. I'm doing it at present. There are still many things to be improved. It's also an attempt to explore new ways to play FPS games. In fact, it can be done very interesting and will be improved in the future.<br/>\r\nYou can see this game is also predestined, thank you for your support, thank you for your purchase.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T02:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce1a7c1d3c5f8d05c50b3a03ed76107e.jpg", "website": "http://www.xumiping.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xu Miping"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xu Miping"], "esrb_rating": null}
