HikeJam can convert the latitude, longitude, and altitude to a playable trail. Choose your gear wisely and make it from shelter to shelter. Your mood plays an important role to your survival. Pick up airdrops or cut down trees to get loot. Be careful of traps, rough weather conditions and wild animals that attack you. I used my passion for long distance and ultralight hiking to design the game and was trying to create an experience that will be with constant improvements even more fun to play. <br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Singleplayer and 8 Person Multiplayer<br/></li><li>Score and Rank System<br/></li><li>Customise your rucksack with badges<br/></li><li>Items<br/></li><li>Animals<br/></li><li>Shelter<br/></li><li>Loot<br/></li><li>Weather system<br/></li><li>CustomTrails<br/></li><li>Ingame Chat / Voice Chat</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44fe626652bc0ac93219c90e5c3360af.jpg", "website": "https://www.HikeJam.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hey Mum Jam No Marmalade"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hey Mum Jam No Marmalade"], "esrb_rating": null}
