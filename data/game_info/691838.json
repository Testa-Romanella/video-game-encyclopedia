{"id": 691838, "slug": "hamster-home", "name": "Hamster Home", "name_original": "Hamster Home", "description": "<p>Hamster Home is a short walking game that is part of the Animals series.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a very simple game in memory of my hamsters. It was done back in time in early 2017, shortly after\u00a0Eldamar died. Actually, he loved being inside the cage, when I took him out, he wanted to return inside. It was his home. So I just had this idea. The long thing is supposed to be a paper tube, and the balls are just toys to play. With the update of 2021, I have added photos of Minireth and Nuada, and a wooden house, since Nuada had one to live in too. Rest in peace my friends.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed with Unity.<br/></p>\n<p>Move with the wasd and jump with space. Move the camera with the mouse. Have fun with the balls and I hope you enjoy the cute pictures of my past hamsters.<br/></p>\n<p>Go back to Animals</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T08:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54fcf7d1c288d310c1fb74d756e8ea85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anamura"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
