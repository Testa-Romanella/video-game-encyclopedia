Although Psy-Crow killed the rebel, the suit fell down to Earth, landing on an Earth Worm. That cosmic twist of fate placed Jim in control of an ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit.<br />\nAnyway, Earthworm Jim found out that Princess What&#39;s-Her-Name had been captured and set out to save her.
