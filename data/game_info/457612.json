Your primary objective is to take the key from your Boss Room and secure it in the chest located somewhere in the building. Once you've done that you must make your way back to your Boss Room. However, locking away the key isn't your only method of slowing down that meddlesome Hero. Hidden in three rooms, the Library, The Front Gate Foyer, and the Study, are traps that you can activate by finding and pressing the golden buttons somewhere in each room. Walk using the W, A, S, and D keys or the arrow keys and turn your head with the mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T04:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/814a543c13b0501dd7d5dda8220bb7ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["21novinskip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
