You control a small fish that gets bigger when it eats another fish smaller than it. For now game includes only five maps with single player. So because it is a early access game, by time our goal is to add;<br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Multi-Player<br/></li><li>Endless mode with endless map,<br/></li><li>Story Mode<br/></li><li>New fish to control and add abilities for every fish<br/></li><li>New enemies<br/></li><li>New Animations<br/></li><li>New Languages</li></ul></strong><br/><br/>So It is it for now but during development process we think we will have better ideas with community's support! So game is simple like bigger fish eats smaller fish!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T02:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a55c6494b9607997bcd261b628da709.jpg", "website": "http://www.thebigstudio.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Big Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Big Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
