{"id": 749673, "slug": "super-cave-runner-dx", "name": "Super Cave Runner DX", "name_original": "Super Cave Runner DX", "description": "<p>Super Cave Runner DX is based from a game developed at the 2022 Global Game Jam by Graeme White and Timothy Drew.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The theme from the game jam was \u201cDuality\u201d. Inspired by the game Canabalt, we designed an endless runner\u00a0game set in a cave filled with various hazards. One of these hazards would be a wall or barrier that would be one of two colours. To break through these barriers, the player would have to match the colour of the barrier.</p>\n<p>After 48 hours, we had a prototype where an animated character would automatically start running, ground would generate at different heights and at different distances from each other, and the player could control the jump.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prototype was filled with bugs and many of the planned mechanics were not implemented. I decided to continue working on this as a personal project and challenge to complete this in one month.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Design, programming, sprites, announcer voices - Graeme White\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Timothy Drew.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Lewis Innes and Robert O'Brien for testing and feedback.</p>\r\nTools and Assets\r\n<p>Game developed with the Unity engine\u00a0(version 2021.2) and the C# programming language.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sprite assets created with Aseprite.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Announcer voices recorded with Audacity.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cPress Start 2P\u201d font designed by \u201cCodeMan38\u201d.
