{"id": 434823, "slug": "station-keeping", "name": "Station Keeping", "name_original": "Station Keeping", "description": "<p>Keep the station alive and in orbit. Conduct orbital trade to obtain needed materials.<br/></p>\n<p>To do that, just move materials from one locker to another. The only question is what to move, where to move, and in what quantities \ud83d\ude42.</p>\n<p>And you don't have to do it alone - the station supports up to 8 crew members in local coop. However, you might need 4 gamepads<br/>and a couple of keyboards connected to comfortably support all 8. And be aware of increased life support materials consumption as the number of crew grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Station Systems<br/></strong>The station has 3 main systems - energy, propulsion and life support.<br/>Each system consists of a control locker and materials locker.<br/>A control locker must have at least 4 working chips for a system to function properly.<br/>A material locker should have additional pods with appropriate material to refill when needed.</p>\n<p>So keep energy, propulsion and life support material lockers filled with batteries (yellow), fuel (red) and oxigen (blue).<br/>Also make sure, that control lockers electronics are fine. Broken chips are marked black on locker indicator and although 1 or 2 is fine,<br/>you eventually need to replace them, so the system will not be compromised with the next chip failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Ports<br/></strong>You station has 2 docking ports that can be used for trade.</p>\n<p>Each port has 2 lockers - a sample locker and a cargo locker.<br/>The first item in a sample locker shows what kind of material you require. And the trade control panel nearby show the quantity you need.<br/>A cargo locker contains any materials you are trading for these items.</p>\n<p>Let say the station needs additional fuel. Pick a docking port and place a spare fuel pod into a sample locker<br/>Now you need some material to trade fuel for.<br/>You see, that it is high demand on system chips right now. Act quick before demand changes.<br/>Take 3 chips and place them in cargo locker next to a sample locker with fuel.<br/>Assuming that demand for fuel is regular, select 5 bars on trade control panel near the sample locker.<br/>That way you are saying that you are ready to trade 3 chips for 5 fuel pods.</p>\n<p>Now, enable the docking port by pressing the button at the edge of the port module.<br/>The button should turn green. And once there is a ship ready to commence the trading operation,<br/>the docking port control button will blink red-green and soon you will see a spaceship docking at the port</p>\n<p>Note, that supply and demand constantly changing, so the price for fuel can be two high (e.g. fuel is in high demand<br/>and you will not be able to get 5 fuel pods even for 5 or 7 chips). Also, there could be not enough materials currently<br/>in orbit ready for trade. So you can wait for a long time until there will be a ship ready to trade.</p>\n<p>You can adjust a trade setup even with an open port by providing additional materials in the cargo locker<br/>or changing the desired number on trade control panel (e.g. reduce the number of fuel cell to 3 or even to 1<br/>if you need them really badly).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Waste<br/></strong>The station generates waste in the form of broken chips.</p>\n<p>And since you are in space, you can't dispose it by throwing it out of the window.<br/>But you can place broken chips in free slots in a cargo locker during trade operations.<br/>The incoming spaceship will pick up and dispose of your waste.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Console Player (up to 4 gamepads are supported)<br/></strong>* move with analog stick or d-pad<br/>* press A/B to use<br/>* press X/Y to exit</p>\n<p><strong>WASD Player<br/></strong>* move with WASD<br/>* press E or Space to use<br/>* press Q or Esc to exit</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Player<br/></strong>* move and jet with Arrow Keys<br/>* press Page Down or use with Right Shift or Enter<br/>* press PageUp or End to close</p>\n<p><strong>VIM Player<br/></strong>* move with HJKL<br/>* press ] or Enter to use<br/>* press [ or \\ to exit</p>\n<p><strong>Accountant Player<br/></strong>* move with Numpad Arrows (8426)<br/>* press Numpad 9 or Numpad Enter to use<br/>* press Numpad 7 or Numpad Substract to exit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/0460378192dda45753c82fe4950e153f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Igor Khotin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
