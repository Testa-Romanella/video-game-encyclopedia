Think Quake 3 meets Command and Conquer, complete with live action cutscenes, terribly cheesy one liners, and an utterly balls to the wall stupid cooperative campaign!<br/><br/>Grab some friends and take control of  Thunderchild's intrepid crew to embark on intergalactic space adventures! Alternatively, blow each other to <strong>smithereens </strong>in Space Quest's deathmatch suite!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay reminiscent of the glory days of late 1990s and early 2000s cheese by Raven Software<br/><br/>This game is actually an old school project that flew WAYYYY out of control. I've tinkered with Space Quest on and off for the past couple of years now. It's a project that was started when I was seventeen years old as a way to procrastinate doing A level maths, and was last touched when I was twenty a couple years back. I'd never really gotten around to releasing it, but here it is now. For free. For the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Special thanks to Blake Robinson's Synthetic Orchestra for royalty free soundtrack use.<br/><br/><br/>*Taste may vary, you might prefer a space adventure that's little more high budget - this game was created on a budget of \u00a340.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T03:16:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab57c5c4acc02c2fc1620b181168f2c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lever Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lever Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
