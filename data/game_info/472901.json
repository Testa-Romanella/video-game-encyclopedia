Simple enough? Now here's the catch: you have to switch the platform on and off in order to complete the level.<br/></p>\n<p>Are you up to the task?</p>\n<p>You can play the game in the browser (using Unity WebGL), or you can also download it and run the executable (Windows only).\u00a0This game actually first published as a downloadable, so no changes are made to the web version.</p><p><strong>[Note: This game contains bright colors and (some) fast moving object.

Control it using keyboard or joystick.<br/></p>\n<p>Later on, you'll find other colored platforms that can be\u00a0switched on and off. Some levels may or may not \"forcing\" you to do this in order to make it to the goal.</p>\n<p>Circles are your enemy! Don't touch it or you will have to restart the level. Colored circles act like platforms too; they can be switched on and off! Use this to your advantage so you can gleefully avoid the (deadly) circles.</p>\n<p>You'll be awarded points when you touch the goal. You can boost your score by blazing through the level as fast as you can, collecting hard-to-reach stars, and beating the level under the ace time.</p>\n<p>In Practice Mode, you can replay all levels that you have played in Arcade mode. Stats for every level can be seen here. You'll be awarded a Master Medal too if you can both collect the star and beat the level within the ace time. See if you can achieve them\u00a0on all levels!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets (except for audio)\u00a0are created by me (Dichi)<br/>SFX provided by\u00a0https://freesound.org/<br/>BGM is \"The Boss\" by Multifaros, available at\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Multifaros/The_Factory/The_Boss</p>\n<p>BTW, this is my first time creating a platformer.\u00a0\u00a0If there are something wrong with the game, feel free to drop a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c8016049f9e570af65ae7341f54ce3a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dichi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
