The game consists of levels, each level is a small location (room), where you need to find an exit. To pass the level you need to get to the key jumping on the furniture, then open the door.<br/>The difficulty is that the floor of the room is flooded with lava, when the player touches lava you must start the level again.<br/><br/>Remember childhood (and maybe not just childhood) with a first-person arcade Lava Pool!<br/>You are a child whose imagination has played out, you see that the floor of your room, and in general all the rooms, turned into lava! Do you have enough dexterity and skill to overcome the way to get out of this bickering? Or maybe you can even fight with the evil lava keepers and save the whole world from burning floors?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efe94a6ab058b65929d63c440baa96b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enjoy Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SRV-game"], "esrb_rating": null}
