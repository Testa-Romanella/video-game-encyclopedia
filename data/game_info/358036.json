After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>This is the third in our Celtic trilogy, suitable for a character that's finished Celtic Queen and perhaps HOLV. Merlin has called you back to his Celtic world because he fears Prince Malin wants to usurp Queen Habren's throne. He's locked up Prince Malin's love, Lady Lotti, and wants the Prince dead by your hand. Meanwhile, Habren is tired of being queen and needs your help to regain control of the Wheel of Time.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select \"Celtic Doom\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 75 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Celtic Queen has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c1b7bc71b7592d884a31ef1e45c29b.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
