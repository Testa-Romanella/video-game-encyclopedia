To develop Project Aurora, CCP teamed up with PlayRaven. CCP, of course, is well known for the Eve Online which was a MMORPG trailblazer when it launched 14 years ago in 2003. Though Project Aurora takes cues from Eve Online, the two will not be set in the same universe.\r\nProject Aurora is based on a concept that CCP has been considering for quite some time now, which is essentially a condensed EVE Online experience on a mobile device that players can take with them wherever they go, but have meaningful adventures in regardless of how much time they put in at any one point.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0a/b0aa875cc347f7fb5c382a19afc51e32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["PlayRaven"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["CCP"], "esrb_rating": null}
