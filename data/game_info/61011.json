Only The Light can keep us safe.<br/><br/>And you can't stay down there in the depths of the bunker. The food is gone and the power can't last much longer, either. Those things out there in the dark will only take so long to find their way in... It's time to go outside and face what's waiting for you out there. Maybe then you can go into The Light, like the others.<br/><br/>THE LIGHT KEEPS US SAFE is a procedurally-generated apocalypse in which only The Light can save us. Use stealth and evasion to avoid terrifying machines that patrol the desolate world, and employ the powers of Light to unpick their deadly traps.<br/><br/>Featuring these terrifying and entertainingly bleak things:<br/><br/><ul><li> Unique light-based interactions and challenges!<br/></li><li> A sprawling world of stealth, survival, and exploration from the makers of SIR, YOU ARE BEING HUNTED and THE SIGNAL FROM T\u00d6LVA. <br/></li><li> Horrifying and aggressive alien-machine enemies!<br/></li><li> Fiendish traps and disturbing hostile environments.<br/></li><li> A procedurally-generated environment, different for each playthrough.<br/></li><li> A grim sense of existential threat (because we're good at that sort of thing...)<br/></li><li> No crafting though, because we find that a bit dull tbh. Sorry!<br/></li><li> A tremendous sense of satisfaction in overcoming certain doom. You want that feeling, don't you? It's a good feeling.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-18T19:43:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4cd660c9264bd6882cfba0d217cd85.jpg", "website": "http://www.big-robot.com/light", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 156, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Robot"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
