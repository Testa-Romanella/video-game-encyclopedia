Among their clients are the van Hoorn family, a prominent Dutch old money dynasty based in \"Holland's Finest Beach\" of Noordwijk aan Zee, in turn renowned, or perhaps notorious, for being frequently visited by prominent figures from across the world.<br/><br/><br/>Yet, while the van Hoorns themselves are nowhere to be found, you do encounter state-sponsored terrorists masquerading as mere frat boys, dodgy business transactions, pervasive corruption and the rest. Of course, this is only the beginning, leaving you wondering whether you have been set up for a fool's errand. Get ready to set out on an odyssey to discover the truth, as you jump into a parallel world where you encounter the reality behind Europe's urban legends, political scandals and conspiracy theories. In order to survive in a brutal and decadent world, you must use your wits in either covert or violent ways.<br/><br/>Total Rendition is set in contemporary times and tells you a story of a world decades in the making as a result of buffoonery, stupidity and complacency. So, what will you do when that world is about to explode?
