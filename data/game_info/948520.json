I hope that you will enjoy this game even though it is a little bit short.</p>\n<p>This is designed to be mostly a thinking type of game. The simple premise is that you are not allowed to walk on the same tile more than once. I made 10 levels to explore this concept. I focused a lot more on the narrative and the feel of the game this time around. I hope that you can feel the difference!<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know if you encounter any bugs, or even if you had any comments!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/9751909d51a3515e3d4b633edf292d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ganthefan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
