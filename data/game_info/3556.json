{"id": 3556, "slug": "alien-isolation", "name": "Alien: Isolation", "name_original": "Alien: Isolation", "description": "<p>Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo\u2019s (Ellen\u2019s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2014-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T17:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/daa/daaee07fcb40744d90cf8142f94a241f.jpg", "website": "http://www.alienisolation.com", "rating": 4.2, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 618, "owned": 5211, "beaten": 846, "toplay": 314, "dropped": 592, "playing": 157}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 419, "ratings_count": 1399, "suggestions_count": 525, "game_series_count": 26, "reviews_count": 1412, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "iOS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "SEGA", "Creative Assembly"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
