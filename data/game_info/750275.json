If you&#39;re familiar with games such as Yume Nikki and you enjoy this kind of entertainment, this game may suit your tastes as well.</p>\n<p>In current demo version, game almost completely covers 2 out of 3 acts. There are 2 possible endings to get (however without cutscenes implemented yet) as well as small prelude to act 3.</p>\n<p>Graphics were done from scratch by me, so you may expect something different.</p>\n<p>Game contains few disturbing scenes and at times graphics depicting mild nudity, so play if you can stand things as such.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T13:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7acea363124e4416b8738284f5af198.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/games/divinity-fatum/17764", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
