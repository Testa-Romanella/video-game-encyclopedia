I don't draw much. So this seemed cool.\u00a0 You move around with the usual ASWD keys and when you collect the star, you are invulnerable to attacks for a little bit and you rewind a couple of seconds back in position. And while you are rewinding, the cat is dancing! Yes, it is similar to Tracer from OW, but mine is k00l3r!!\u00a0</p><p>This was made during the\u00a0I Can't Draw Game Jam. This is actually my first successfully \"finished\" game jam game thing. W00t. I started 4 days before the jam ended, so I didn't allot the full time given. I spent most of my time learning how to draw and animate, which was a pain. Oh well, hope you like it!</p>\n<p>This contains no sounds. I might want to add sounds later.</p>\n<p>I forgot to draw a tail on the cat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T03:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/783a411cd534f8a22fbd91f0a74270da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["therealdrew"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
