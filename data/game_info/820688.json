{"id": 820688, "slug": "push-the-dice", "name": "Push The Dice", "name_original": "Push The Dice", "description": "<p>Push The Dice is a tile based puzzle game, where the goal is to Push The Dice in order to win. It's that simple. Although you might have to make sure the dices are facing the correct way, and you might also have to do a bit of math but the game is still as simple as pushing the dice in order to win.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There might be some issues and bugs that are present in the\u00a0browser build but not in the windows build. If you have a windows computer then I recommend to download the windows build for the best playing experience.</p>\n<p><em><strong>~~ CONTROLS</strong></em><strong><em>: ~~</em></strong><br/><strong>WASD </strong>/ <strong>A</strong><strong>rrow Keys</strong>\u00a0= Move from one tile at a time.\u00a0<strong>Move into a dice to push it.</strong><br/><strong>Z</strong> = Undo your previous mistake. Keep pressing it to undo more\u00a0mistakes.<br/><strong>R\u00a0</strong>= Restart the level from beginning and undo all your mistakes.<br/><strong>ESC</strong> = Return to the main menu if you want to <strong>skip a level</strong> or change the <strong>options.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>~~ ABOUT THE 3D\u00a0DICE: ~~<br/></em></strong>Yep that's right, this 2D game has a 3D dice that you can rotate around. The 3D\u00a0dice is a guide which will help you and show you which way you can rotate the dice. Or you can just brute force through the levels, that works too.<br/><br/>Click the left mouse\u00a0button whilst the mouse is on top of the 3D dice and drag the cursor in order\u00a0to rotate the 3D dice.<br/>Press right mouse button whilst the cursor is on top of\u00a0the 3D dice to reset it's rotation to where it started.<br/>Whilst dragging the dice, use the mouse scrollwheel to rotate the dice in the Z axis (that's mumbo jumbo for \"rotate it even more\")<br/><br/><strong><em>~~ ABOUT: ~~</em></strong><br/>This game was made in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2022:<br/>https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022<br/>Theme: ROLL OF THE DICE<br/>The game fits the theme by having you push dices, which can be considered as rolling them.</p>\n<p>Game, Art, Music &amp; Sound Effects by RCJ15</p>\n<p><strong>~~ WHAT I USED TO MAKE THE GAME: ~~</strong><br/>Unity as the game engine.<br/>Aseprite for art.<br/>BFXR for sound effects.<br/>FL Studio for music &amp; some sound effects.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.
