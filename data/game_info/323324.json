The game's rich otherworldly soundscapes are composed from recordings taken aboard space shuttles.<br/><br/>The goal is to reconstruct an image by stopping rotating circles cut out from the image. For each level, the animated pieces draw increasingly complex patterns. The challenge is to be attentive to image juxtapositions in order to stop each circles movement at the right moment. <br/><br/>Now available on the App Store with retina graphics!<br/><br/>\"Beautiful. Engaging. Excellent transmedia incorporation of space imagery.\u201d \u2013 Yvonne Clearwater, New Media Innovation Leader at NASA / Ames Research Center", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0dff84ea2683d15db9890b718b8e18_0MBXFdS.jpg", "website": "https://okogame.ch", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Playables"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Playables"], "esrb_rating": null}
