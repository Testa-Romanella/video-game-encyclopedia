You will need to part ways from it in order to progress, haggling with merchants to acquire resources or simply to bribe a lazy woodworker. However, you can also gather treasures (such as fruit or cloth) and trade them back for cattle. And of course, when talking about money you can't forget thieves, who will try to steal your cattle and take it to their hideouts. Defend your herd and kill the bandits, or risk losing all your 'funds'.<br/>But that's not all: the sheep, goats and cows you will conduct to the God of the mountain each have another use.</p>\n<p>Prepare to spend money in order to make money.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD to move</strong></li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button to attack with your spear</strong></li><li><strong>F to interact</strong></li><li><strong>Q to stop the cattle close to you from advancing</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Code by Jofer</p>\n<p>Art by me</p>\n<p>Music by Ryunocore https://soundcloud.com/ryunocore</p>\n<p>The game is probably buggy and you might run into issues, if so please let us know!
