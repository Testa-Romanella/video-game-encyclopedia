Eyeing the surging video game market, electronics giant TEC rushes to develop the Redshift, a microdisc-based gaming handheld.<br/><br/>Underpowered even before it was released, and with a gimmicky 3D mode that gave users headaches when used for longer than a few minutes, the Redshift was widely panned and became an expensive flop.<br/><br/>But the story doesn\u2019t end there. Now, in 1997, the Redshift is a popular hackable device, easy to find in bargain bins and at garage sales. The Redshift homebrew scene begins to grow as hackers swap tips and trade increasingly clever homebrew games that push the hardware to its limits.<br/><br/>All of this is of absolutely no benefit to TEC, who never made another game console again.</strong><br/><br/>The Redshift is a fictional handheld game console in the universe of the puzzle programming game EXAPUNKS. This player will allow you to play Redshift games made by other EXAPUNKS players, but you'll need the full version of EXAPUNKS to create your own.<br/><br/><ul><li> Play Redshift games created by your friends, even if you don\u2019t own EXAPUNKS!<br/></li><li> Includes a questionable 3D mode! (Requires red/blue \"anaglyph\" 3D glasses, not included.)<br/></li><li> Powered by advanced EXA (EXecution Agent) technology.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79e/79e9656510338a1080eef36201114e8c.jpg", "website": "http://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 175, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zachtronics"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zachtronics"], "esrb_rating": null}
