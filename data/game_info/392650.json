Continue matching 3 for higher combo bonuses. If you fail to match 3 you will loose your combo bonus, so be careful. Get the yarn for bigger scores. Use the thumb grips/pads to move around, both for an extra speed boost, but watch out for dizziness!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T05:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/804/80470f140fa36ef93b4479fd4a0f2100.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Reflection Rip", "Raev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
