An AI will try to unbalance your pillar. It may look easy when you start, but be warned, the AI will soon learn your moves and will begin to counter them more actively. <br/></p>\n<p>Saved data is binary encrypted and stored in your phone. In this way you can save your high scores between play sessions. Also, a fully functional settings tab is available to be used.</p>\n<p>Any problems and suggestions, please leave a comment and I will answer. This game is still in development, as more levels and game modes will be added at a later date.</p>\n<p>Donations are always welcomed but not required.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a38aa792e90616d0f71f3cbde8f5c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Florin Pain"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
