It would seem that space libertians, free and independent warriors, prowling in the vastness of the universe for a chance to snatch their lucky jackpot, had to penetrate into the more hellish parallels of neutrino star clusters. But this small shining point of INTELLIGENT K87 station, hovering at the edge of the event horizon, its weak nitric trickles, for a moment shuddering and disappearing into the huge all-embracing void of the Black Hole, made even the Costarian turn yellow with horror.<br/>Our INFILTRA has passed more than 5 light years, filtering signals from malfunctioning systems of ships, stations and artificial planets. Why INTELLIGENT K87! I do not believe in bad signs, forebodings and other nonsense. But here my brain began desperately to send out calls not to receive the faulty signal. Maybe these are just flashbacks of typical space stories about INTELLIGENT K87 - all these stories about cracks and hybrogembs, techno-hybrids explicated by a black hole into our planar life projections.<br/><br/>The docking of INFILTRA with INTELLIGENT K87 went surprisingly smoothly. No station system has blocked our LOCKER. It was as if the station was waiting for us. The launch of the station's biocomponent sniffer-analyzers revealed the standard level of live presence of the space shuttle. We have already passed the third block of the living compartment, but no one contacted us. Such emptiness is alarming.<br/><br/>A presence is detected at the station, but the sensors are not detecting movement. All living things of the station froze. \u201cAnd apparently it also dematerialized,\u201d states our First, entering the 4th empty compartment of the station. \u201cWe must leave the station and return to INFILTRA. From our ship we will be able to thoroughly scan the insides of this damn empty shell\u201d. This decision was fatal. As soon as we deactivated the weapon and turned towards the docking socket, sensors from all points of the station began to record movement. The station's system instantly worked on the principle of sectional blocking in case of a threat. We are trapped.<br/><br/>Any libertian knows that only the headleader system can unlock the section stopper. And it is on the captain's IntraPod. Apparently, it's time for us to meet the captain of the INTELLIGENT K87 station. If such exists.<br/><br/>////////After all, we are here to re-establish LOST CONTACT////////<br/><br/>LOST\u00a0CONTACT is a thrilling virtual reality shooter.<br/>The game visuals represent realistically designed interiors of space stations.<br/>As the main character within a game you will be transported on the research station INTELLIGENT K8 that has been captured by the hybrid monsters.<br/>You will be faced to fight horrifying deep space creatures in a close proximity of a Black Hole.<br/>Your dexterity is the only means to increase the chance of your survival in this world occupied by ruthless mutants.<br/>Every encounter with another sinister inhabitant of the space station reveals the true hidden goals of the INTELLIGENT K8 research team.<br/>If luck is on your side, you'll be able to interrupt the LOST CONTACT mode and send a SOS signal.
