The idea in this game mode is to simply reach the end of every level without being touched one single time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Endless Mode:\u00a0In this mode the player's main objective will be to stay alive as much as possible. It will feature both game modes.</p>\n\n<p>The game will also feature a High Score leader board so players can track their best scores in every level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/47887b4305e91ed62fae81faa5b37908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Panopticon Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
