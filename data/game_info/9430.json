Black Wing Foundation.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Set in a distant future, where humankind mastered the interplanetary travel, a Chaos cult is created. These cultists raid other spaceships, brainwash the passengers and go on. The main character sets out to kill all the cultists. </p>\n<p>The developers say that there is not much plot present in the game and want the player to think they are saving a princess. Although, that is what you are doing.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Chaos Domain is heavily influenced by the old side-scrolling games of the Sega Mega Drive era like Contra. The main objective of the game&#39;s levels is either to get to its end or beat a boss. There are 30 levels present in the game. The players have to complete their objective in a limited amount of time getting the most points possible.</p>\n<p>The game features a weapon upgrade and ability systems. The players can purchase abilities and weapons in an in-game store using the points they got awarded after playing a level. </p>\n<p>The game also features a single-screen multiplayer. At any point of the game, a second player can join in. There is no online multiplayer present in the game.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s art style is a mix between the Ancient Egypt mythology and cyberpunk. The music is also influenced by this mix.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd682fb98a6f324d2cd415c5a24309bf.jpeg", "website": "http://holywarp.com/", "rating": 1.89, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 1185, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 56, "suggestions_count": 509, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 56, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Black Wing Foundation", "Holy Warp"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kiss", "Holy Warp"], "esrb_rating": null}
