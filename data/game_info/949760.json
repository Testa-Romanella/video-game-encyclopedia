The theme was \"Too Much.\"\u00a0This was our first game jam and we built the game in Unity.</p>\n<p>You use the WASD keys to move the bat. The objective is to avoid the spotlights while trying to survive for as long as you can.\u00a0Our best time was 2:05! Can you beat it?</p>\n<p>While the game may seem simple, it was still challenging for us as our first game and we learned a lot along the way. We struggled a lot with the camera and resolution in Unity and weren't able to get it to look the same on multiple resolutions. Hoping to do better next time, we're really looking forward to future jams!</p>\n<p>We used the following two assets. Thank you to both creators!</p>\n<p>Music was the Expansion track from\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/mystery-music-collection-pack-1\u00a0(user:\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>The bat sprite came from\u00a0https://opengameart.org/node/77508\u00a0(user:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/bagzie)</p>\n<p>My friend Charlie and I made this game together.
