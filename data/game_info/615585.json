The main challenges were balancing the physics of the player character, and writing the scoring code. If I had more time to improve it, I would improve the terrain and level layout. I would also improve the music. It could use animations for the player character too. It could incorporate powerups/collectibles, and more platformer elements.</p><p>Thanks for viewing/playing!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/085c9654e2aacde590735b243d48133b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beathelas"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
