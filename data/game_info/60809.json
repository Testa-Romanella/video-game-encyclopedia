Search for busted four-wheelers and transform them into legendary diesel-drinking monsters!<br/><br/><br/>Disassemble the entire car down to the frame and then rebuild it with whatever parts you want. Diesel trucks are a lifestyle, and the garage is your new home. Drop it low or lift it up. It's all up to you!<br/><br/><br/>Invite up to three of your friends to the garage and pick unique characters to compliment your skills. Together you can seek for rare parts on junkyards, completely rebuild trucks from the frame up or race each other.<br/><br/><br/>Put your tuning and driving skills to the test. Tweak your truck's performance to achieve the best results and prove dominance over your opponents when racing against them online.<br/><br/><br/>Take advantage of your spray gun and create liquid awesomeness. Finish the truck with our custom decals or make ones yourself, to add your unique touch! Don't forget to share your best photos on Social Media. Let the world see your opus magnum!<br/><br/><br/>Scavenge junkyards to find rare parts or send your buddies for the hunt. When you seek for car parts, you can find some old rusty wreckage. Don't get fooled by its look - that decayed frame can become the next Mega Ram Runner. When you finish your build you can sell it, or... give it away to make someone's day truckin' awesome!<br/><br/><br/>Add whatever you can create. From simple decals to entire levels, as the game provides full mod support. If you daydream about modifying your truck with self-made custom decals, the Brothers of the Beard are here to make it happen!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-26T03:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/802d9749d45b5c235648f57fe92de274.jpg", "website": "https://dieselbrothers-thegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 35, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Code Horizon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Code Horizon"], "esrb_rating": null}
