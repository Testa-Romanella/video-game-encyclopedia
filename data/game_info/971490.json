Tomes and Quests has you covered! <br/><br/>This is a word game at heart with an RPG twist to give you a whole new take on word-building puzzlers. <br/><br/>Three friends are trapped in a book, forced to battle their way through a fantasy land rife with magic. It\u2019s not all bad though - now they have awesome abilities powered by words! And you just happen to be the lexicon master that can help them save the worlds!<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Attack enemies during battles by placing interconnecting letter tiles on the play board to spell words. <br/><br/>Each letter tile has a point value; more points = more power, triggering your heroes\u2019 special abilities! Upgrade your classes and upgrade your equipment through loot you find to unlock epic strategies.<br/><br/>As you spell a word you can see the damage you\u2019ll cause in the enemy\u2019s health bar.  Match your hero\u2019s element to your target\u2019s vulnerabilities for critical results!<h3>A Word RPG</h3>After each battle collect your loot and experience to help you on your quest, unlocking new classes and abilities!<br/><br/>Your heroes start with three base classes and you can unlock new options through quests:<br/><ul><li>Sage \u2192 Alchemist, Summoner, etc.<br/></li><li>Rogue  \u2192 Archer, Beastmaster, etc.<br/></li><li>Brawler  \u2192 Berserker, Templar, etc.</li></ul>You\u2019ll need to find them all and master them to discover the full story!<h3>Words for All</h3>Tomes and Quests has a dynamic difficulty system that keeps the game accessible to all.<br/><strong>Play in your best language!</strong><br/>The story is translated into English and French, and all the word games can be switched to any of these languages at any time!<br/><ul><li> English<br/></li><li>  Fran\u00e7ais<br/></li><li>  Deutsche\t<br/></li><li>  Italiano<br/></li><li>  Nederlands<br/></li><li>  Espa\u00f1ol<br/></li><li>  Portugu\u00eas</li></ul><br/><strong>Lost a fight?  </strong><ul><li>Switch your classes and equipment to tweak your strategy and try again immediately at no penalty!<br/></li><li>You can always grind earlier battles for XP and loot to level up your class and upgrade your equipment!</li></ul>Mini-game challenge settings adapt to your skills: how you score helps set goal targets later in the game, so the game progresses at your speed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T18:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618d87d07782ac029a0cac451d16c487.jpg", "website": "https://www.trailblazergames.com/tomesandquests/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Trailblazer Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Trailblazer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
