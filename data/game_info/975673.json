Provisions are running low. However, the only source of fresh water has been captured by a mad priest who demands human sacrifices. With the help of your native allies, you will have to defeat the bloodthirsty priest, replenish your supplies and continue your journey.</h3><br/><h3>You arrive in a Spanish colony, which is besieged by the warlike Aztecs. The local ruler of Chipahua demands that the conquistadors liberate the captured village. Warriors from the crocodile tribe want to enter into a military alliance with the Spaniards against the locals. You have to choose a side in the conflict, achieve peace and find a way to penetrate the Gorge of Fear - where a new level of the game will begin.</h3><br/><br/>\u25aa Explore the location and complete story missions. The map mode will help you with this, where you can get all the information about the current task.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa Earn experience and develop your character\u2019s skills. Useful skills will help you strengthen your squad with more warriors, use artillery, and find more gold and hearts.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa\u00a0The main resource in the game is gold. For gold coins in the conquistador camp, you can hire volunteers, buy food and supplies, and learn some useful skill. The Aztecs did not understand the value of this metal.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa\u00a0The Aztec blood gods demanded human sacrifices. Therefore, hearts will be useful to you for trading with Indian tribes. In addition, hearts will help restore the health of your warriors on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa\u00a0Battles with enemies take place in a separate location. Before the battle begins, you have to arrange your warriors in such a way as to protect the flag. During the battle, you will be able to send your warriors to attack or return them to their original positions. You cannot control the actions of a specific warrior.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa Each fighter in your squad has unique characteristics - spearmen do not allow the enemy to get closer, shooters use arquebuses and crossbows. Field fortifications slow down the enemy's advance, and fighting dogs can frighten any enemy.<br/><br/><br/>\u25aa Using the \u201cFriend of the Indians\u201d skill, you can recruit warlike natives to your squad. And the \"Death Whistle\" will allow you to resurrect skeletons before each battle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T07:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d376a35d89ab4ba8e481d7afe72efc8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Geo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Dark Geo"], "esrb_rating": null}
