It is an in-fiction document that can be handed to the players as part of a discovery they make in the Unknown Regions of space. It also hints at challenges and oddities that comprise the titular space vessel. Things are left intentionally vague to inspire GMs. It comes with a built-in \"history\" by virtue of the Survey Corps logs of Ion Huxley. Take what you want, leave what you don't. Keep it weird.</p>\n<p>This adventure seed was made for the SWRPG Adventure Contest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:29:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/016f50c03df065dbd66b03852ae65ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luzelli"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
