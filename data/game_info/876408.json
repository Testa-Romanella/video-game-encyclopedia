In both of them the main purpose is to survive avoiding the demons in the platforms and jumping over them to eliminate them.</p>\n<p>- In heaven, the player has 3 lives but obtains 10 points with each demon eliminated. \r\n</p>\n<p>- In hell, the player has only one life but obtains 20 points with each demon eliminated. \r\n</p>\n<p>- If the demon passes through the angel while it\u2019s not jumping, the player will lose one life. Moreover, in some levels there will be obstacles that hurt the player.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n<p>Arrow Left or O to Move Left</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow Right or P\u00a0to Move Right</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow Up or\u00a0Space to Jump</p>\n<p>Combine the movements to kill the enemies.</p>\n<p>This game can be played in the Amstrad CPC 464 machine and in modern computers with a simulator.
