Good luck, and thanks for downloading my little project!</p>\n<p>If you want to program something like this, make sure to follow lazy dev's tutorial at this link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P0qjjiG8G5FBgqwpqMU7rBk<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffb8e98d7a321ff88ce25d9a9943437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ziro Dev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
