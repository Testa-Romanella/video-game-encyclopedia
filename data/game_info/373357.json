In another case, when you are hit by a different color bullet, you will lose a live immediately.</p>\n<p>If a bullet of a different color is close to your aircraft, you can change your mode to the same color of the bullet and bounce it away.</p>\n<p>As you destroy your enemies, you will gain Max Balance points.
