Copper has to fight the thief of those stole outlines but he doesn't know what to expect !</p><p>  It took a while to come up with a theme that had a good idea and let me mostly focus on one aspect I love doing most which is art ! So i decided to go with missing line of characters and making a game plot around art</p><p>  Making it was a lot more time consuming than i expected and had to cut out doing shadows etc. In my previous Foxventure game it took me way too long to get a fox walking animation so I tried  my best to stay away from large animations and stick too small movements that would be still pleasing to the eye.</p><p>    I also decided to mostly go with purple and orange since they're two contrasting colours which made the main character stand out. However purple always gives a pretty and magical feel to any game or art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b483b25d4b3d8a587c58b6b2460dc01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Copper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
