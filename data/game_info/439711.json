SF is very early in development, and I would eventually love to add more levels, getting increasingly more difficult. It may still have a few bugs here and there, but I've playtested it for a while, and it runs pretty smoothly, and the main functions work good.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall Concept:\u00a0The player has three lives in which to break all the bricks before them. There is no time limit, either. The player can earn a score, as well as a high score that carries over upon game over. Once all the bricks are broken, the game resets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: The \"A\" and \"D\" keys move the spatial paddle to the left and right, respectively, and the space bar fires the fracture sphere.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5de/5deda771f4ea4ac42b7ed8ac9f4ceaf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
