Inspired by the themes \"My Home is where my Toilet Paper is\" and \"Looking backwards\", we wanted to recreate a classic game and very quickly, we came up with the idea of the very well known game \"Donkey Kong\", but its an actual donkey that throws toilet paper at the poo he just produced.</p>\n<p>The Game features four levels of increasing difficulty and after Level 4, it loops back to Level 1.</p>\n<p>We had great fun making this game and we hope you have as much fun playing. :)</p>\n<p>STORY:<br/>So Donky just wanted to take a dump, but he missed toilet and now the poo needs to finds its way back to be flushed. To make things worse, Donky can't reach his butt to wipe it and as he is very clumsy, he drops lots of toilet paper rolls. If poo gets hit by these, it will be reset to start. But poo will not surrender...</p><p>CONTROLS:<br/>Left Arrow\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walk left<br/>Right Arrow\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Walk right<br/>Up Arrow / Space\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Jump / Reorient while airbourne<br/>Return\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Reset level<br/>Escape\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Quit game</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/>MarioCake \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Game Design, Lead Programming, Animation)<br/>SarahAndreaRoyce \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Game Design, Graphics Design)<br/>metalpriest94\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Game Design, Music, Additional Programming)</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL CREDITS:<br/>-shweta (Honorary Team Member)<br/>soundbible.com for providing royalty-free sounds</p>\n<p>SPECIAL THANKS TO:<br/>All the guests and the team at Berlin Mini Jam</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/feb/feb40825dcb6ef445742d9e6a34dbd79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["metalpriest94"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
