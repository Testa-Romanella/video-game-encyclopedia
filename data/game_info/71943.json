Like checkers, tap another fuse to \"jump\" over its neighbor and then tap the empty hole it should land in. The jumped fuse will be automatically removed. Make sure that the three holes are right next to each other and in a straight line. The game only lets you select where you can legally move. If you remove all but one fuse, then you win!<br/><br/>*Multiple Board Types*<br/>Beautiful graphics and three board shapes: triangle, plus, and octagon. For an added challenge, try the custom game types with random missing peg spots (oh yes, it\u2019s hard). The plus shaped board is the traditional game of peg solitaire.<br/><br/>*Time Yourself*<br/>Choose your board type and select a peg to remove to begin the timer. Race against yourself to see how fast you can beat each game board. <br/><br/>*Compare with Friends*<br/>Peg board is OpenFeint and Game Center enabled so you can share your shockingly low times with all your friends and compete against the rest of the world to become the Peg Board Master.<br/><br/>*Graphics*<br/>Visually stunning with beautiful Retina Display capable graphics.<br/><br/>Revisit your childhood playing the game popularized by Cracker Barrel and supposedly first was invented by a French aristocrat in the 17th century while incarcerated in prison.
