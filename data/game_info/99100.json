It all begins on a postapocalyptic earth and proceeds into space. Ultimately, your journey will be a metaphor about life and death, a road that every person has to walk down alone. The only choices you get while on your path to the inevitable end: keep your head up high or forfeit.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game features a bold atmosphere with seven unique stages. Each of them includes a unique boss that will challenge your skills. Cyberpunk 3776 boasts hours of breathtaking action, ship upgrades and floating healthpods.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tGood Luck Pilots!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\twww.cyberpunk3776.com\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you are a member of the press, making lets play videos or running a streaming channel feel free to get in touch via \r\n\tTwitter or my Website.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PILOT PACK:</strong>           (PC&amp;OSX Build, Wallpapers)<br/>\n<strong>VETERAN PACK:</strong>   (PC&amp;OSX Build, Soundtrack, Handbook, Wallpapers)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e8770ae4d2d659f3f363b11fceb347.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Peter Hann"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
