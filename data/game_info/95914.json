The full game would be a dungeon crawling RPG with a focus on moving through overworld maps in the style of games such as Rolan's Curse, Zelda, et al, and combat would ensue upon contact with the enemy.<br/></p><p>A concept that was being designed in was pseudo-randomness: Providing random item drops to enhance the player character, as well as random map variants chosen from a selection of three maps per \"level.\" Allowing the player to grow stronger without barring access of previous areas could enable a simple enemy and item driven narrative. <br/><br/>Presented is one enemy with one attack - The Guardian, which has a simple danmaku style spread that attacks from one side or the other. </p><p>The Guardian has a fairly obvious weakpoint. Other places will not provide as much damage.<br/></p><p>Might finish it when I get some time, since it was very fun to work on in between other projects. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e09e562fcf5a27950e85cfa23938e4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pastellian"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
