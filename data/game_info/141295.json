Control up to 100 individual units, and use them to destroy the enemies base before they destroy yours. But in Spheres when your units die, they are replaced with two smaller, and less healthy versions. Use these tiny ships to your advantage to crush the rudimentary AI. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fd/1fd1d3604989a2006815e7b3fa72380d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaseOwens"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
