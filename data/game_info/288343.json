In the 20th age, doom will fall on the land, and all who cannot fight the darkness will be consumed.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Now, this is normally the part where you play as\u00a0some hero who is tasked or fated with finding the Holy Plot Device of Antioch, but that's where\u00a0<em>Omen</em> is different.\u00a0 In this game, all you get to do is\u00a0<strong>move resources around.</strong> The factions, and their destiny, all fall out from your choices, but you are none of them. Ages and factions will come and go, but will any survive what the\u00a0<em>Omen</em> portends?<br/></p>\n<p>This game prototype was made in the week from Jan 20 to Jan 26, 2019.\u00a0</p>\r\nAll the Esoteric Stuff You Should Learn\r\n<p><em>(Here be spoilers, as a warning\u00a0for those that would rather figure out the mysteries on their own.)</em></p>\n<ul><li>Click the red, double-headed arrows to swap resources. You get two swaps per age, and your first swap affects what your second swap is allowed to be.</li><li>There are two types of resources:\u00a0forests and rivers. They aren't accumulated specifically, but indirectly lead to growth.</li><li>Around the five resource points are the five settlements--two are settled to start. There are two types of settlement: town and city.</li><li>Every settlement belongs to a faction. The faction names\u00a0are listed in the sidebar near the top.</li><li>Each settlement has two scores:\u00a0economy and culture. Economy is used for expansion and war, culture affects how factions splinter and a thing that's discussed later.</li><li>What the factions plan to do, along with what they have done, is detailed in the sidebar.</li><li>A settlement's economy goes up based on the number of types of resources that are adjacent.</li><li>A settlement's culture goes up one each turn. (Some bonuses can be earned.)</li><li>Factions redistribute their scores a little bit\u00a0each age depending on how their settlements are laid out.\u00a0</li><li>Cities can expand to new territory and war with other settlements, but towns cannot.</li><li>Factions prefer empty spots, then spots with varied resources when planning expansion. They will also fight for already occupied land.</li><li>War compares the attacker's economy to the defender's plus half of one neighboring ally's (if applicable). Ties go to the defender. Both attackers and defenders can be wiped out by a war's outcome. A conquered, surviving settlement is captured--it becomes part of the attacker's faction.</li><li>Warring costs culture, and if culture goes to zero, the settlement dissolves.</li><li>When settlements are destroyed they leave behind a ruin. Ruins that aren't settled on are first hidden, then lost completely. The \"R\" next to a settlement indicates the ruin and its state.</li><li>When a settlement is built on a ruin, the settlement gets bonus culture points every age, until the culture well is used up. This well is generally the culture score of the settlement that left the ruin behind.</li><li>If a settlement remains under one faction's control for a long time, and maintains a high culture score, they will craft and/or be able to use an artifact!</li><li>Settlements with artifacts will leave them behind if wiped out. If the ruins are settled, the new settlement gets the artifact, but might not be able to use it yet.</li><li>The white ankh near a settlement means they have an artifact. the grey means they could use one, but don't have it. The illuminated ankh means the settlement can use the artifact they have!</li><li><strong>Artifacts are the key to a faction's survival in the final age!</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da49414c6f4c4e4f2dfaf4b96b88438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["epiblitikos"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
