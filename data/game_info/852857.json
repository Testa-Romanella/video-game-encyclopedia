Create multiple characters who are always working, even when you're gone! This game is for any true RPG game fan!<br/>While you're offline, all your characters continue grinding, gathering resources, crafting items, and defeating bosses! IdleOn gets more complex the more you play, and with features like Tower Defense, Pet Battles, Cooking and more, there's always content to play!<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES <br/>\u2022 17 unique classes to specialize into! Will you max out idle gains, or go for max loot drop chance?<br/>\u2022 250 skill perks to play with! A minmax dream!<br/>\u2022 More content than any other idle game, and rarely found in other RPG games! Complete Post Office Orders, collect and upgrade Stamps, deposit Statues, hunt rare monster for special crafting recipes, pray at the Obol Altar, compete in minigames, build a factory, command pet battles, do research, and more! What other idle games even have half as cool of features? None of them of course!<br/>\u2022 Unlimited idle gains, unlike most idle Games that cap you at 12 hours. Ew, right?<br/>\u2022 Level up 12 unique skills in true RPG fashion: Mining, Smithing, Alchemy, Fishing, Woodcutting, Construction, Breeding, Cooking, and more!<br/>\u2022 Talk to 50+ NPC's, all with hand-drawn pixel art animations<br/>\u2022 Witness the mental decline of the developer who made this game all by themselves! They've gone so insane that they speak of themselves in the 3rd person!<br/>\u2022 200+ unique Equipment, like Helmets, Rings, uh, weapons... you know, all the normal stuff in an MMO<br/>\u2022 Talk with other REAL people! Kind of like how I'm talking to you right now, except you'll get to talk back!<br/>\u2022 Get HYPED for new content coming in the future by joining my discord at: Discord.gg/idleon<br/>\u2022 Yo man, life is too short to be reading entire game descriptions. You got this far, so you either REALLY need to go download the game, or you just scrolled to the bottom to see what's here. If so, there's nothing here except a smiley face with a nose :-)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T06:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/0544b1d0a658c2ed6bea23ce5928bad7_uQT2H2X.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lavaflamestudios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Lavaflamestudios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
