{"id": 721642, "slug": "decay-scitydreamer", "name": "Decay (scitydreamer)", "name_original": "Decay (scitydreamer)", "description": "<p>content warnings: current events, death, suicide</p><p>A short game I wanted to make to take\u00a0 bit of a break from\u00a0I Hate You, Please Suffer, which is a more miserable realization of the negative aspects of that world. I guess you can call this a spin-off game.</p>\n<p>Also you can probably tell that I'm being turned into the Joker by real world circumstances</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Q: The game kinda runs like shit</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yeah I kinda hate RPG Maker MV and MZ, but you can do more cool things in it over VX Ace, so it's hard to say what's good or bad. Playing it in download form would probably be a better experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What's with the art style?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I wanted to give a unique look but I didn't want to fully commit to a full new art style for something short (besides the enemies). My approach was to make all the environments look fucked up while the characters and objects are grayscale to represent how people are expected to continue on with a monotonous life in a chaotic world.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: This is too hard.</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yeah</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If it takes place in the same world as other works, shouldn't the main character develop magic powers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yeah but then that'd make this game kinda cool when I want it to be a miserable experience. Sometimes you can just ignore lore.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I give you money and power?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A: Check out my other stuff. If you like RPGs, I mainly make those. I also write about games, so check that out and maybe share reads you liked with other people. And also I got a Patreon I guess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:35:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b17625d6b2bc7953a2f1b561f651c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scitydreamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
