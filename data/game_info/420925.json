This time, Negative Space cropped up, and I felt like I\u00a0<em>had\u00a0</em>to finally get back on the Trijam horse for it! I've been\u00a0<em>obsessed\u00a0</em>with negative space in game design for over a decade, specifically for this idea of inverse collisions environments, where two characters or systems exist in each other's negative space. I've made several games in that family, this being the newest addition! These always end up being my favorite games to make... I need to do more!</p>\n<p>This game was also my first game of 7 in my solo jam non-GDC 2020 Week of Games!\u00a0where I'm making a new small game\u00a0<em>every day\u00a0</em>that I'm stuck in San Francisco due to GDC 2020's cancellation.</p>\n<p>It was also submitted to Decade Jam and Neverending Jams, because everything should be! I'm most excited in submitting it to Decade Jam, as this is still a concept I love and hope to continue to nurture and grow over the next decade. Maybe within a decade I can make my old dream game, Negativity, in its true form!</p>\r\nDev Vlog", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T06:00:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd7b21dd7d2d84d77019276360ea17f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
