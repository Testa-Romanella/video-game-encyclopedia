Explore the lands and fight monsters with your crew of buds.</p>\n<p>This is probably the most ambitious game I ever made in a game jam, and the result is a big ol mess. An interesting mess though, give it a shot!</p>\n<p>You explore a procedurally generated world map and encounter creatures and monsters. Creatures encountered can be negociated, traded with, or even recruited!\u00a0Battles are chaotic AI-controlled brawls between the two groups! There is a lot of needless complexity underlying the combat, I probably could have kept it much more simple, but it was a lot of fun to figure out.</p>\n<p>Game made by Francis Coulombe, with music by Babu Oji!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c0/6c0418cf9b27b9b333d77b1eaed8e3b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrankieSmileShow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
