You must control Minky and help him make his way through the city. Minky's a kind creature who hates to be a bother, unfortunately his large body and uncontrollable tail often lead him to destroy anything that gets in his way, this stresses him out.</p>\n<p>Try to get through the city causing as little destruction as possible. Destroying buildings will increase Minky's anxiety, too much anxiety will cause a panic attack, leading Minky to become out of control for some time. If Minky destroys too much of the city or spends too much time getting home, it will be GAME OVER, and he will give up and cry.</p>\n<p>Controls-<br/>Mouse: Camera<br/>W: Walk Forwards<br/>S: Slow Down<br/>A/D: Turn Left/Right<br/>Space: Hold To charge Jump/Release to Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Royalty Free Music from Bensound included.<br/><br/>Credit</p>\n<p>Alex Butt<br/>Eevee Kennedy<br/>Sam Baker<br/>Paul Montgomery<br/>Leah Downey<br/>Gregory Lee (Deer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b99/b99e912a2e88c9e92908a0df45edf463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Buttercream Dream"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
