The disc also doubled up as a vinyl record (the most popular media of the era), holding further information on our civilisation in an audio format; an initial message to any alien race whom was to discover it.</p>\n<p>In 1985, we received an answer.</p>\n<p>Data recently retrieved by renowned Astrophysicist Dr. Martin Wendt from his contacts at the NASA archives revealed that the Atlantis intercepted a capsule of unknown origin whilst in orbit around Earth on her maiden flight (STS-51-J). The capsule had no obvious propulsion system and analysis and carbon dating left experts puzzled - the object was less than one year old. It was as if it had been carefully placed, knowing that the shuttle would cross its path.</p>\n<p>The report states that if the capsule was intended as a reply to our Voyager, then it meant that the respondent had managed to somehow translate our recording without interrupting the mission itself - the onboard computers had not reported any interference since launch. The more disturbing fact that this theory suggests is that the alien civilisation must have been present in our solar system during the initial planetary stages of the Voyager mission, as the probe didn't even begin its interstellar flight until 1990.</p>\n<p>After much debate, the capsule was opened in 1986 at an unreferenced location back on Earth. Despite clearly being of alien origin and covered in detailed hieroglyphic-characters, inside scientists found an artifact that was instantly recognisable as a replica of a Commodore 64 data cartridge - a format that was widely used on the most popular computer of the period. The project thereafter became known as \"Not Even Human\", named after what the main inscription on the cartridge and its container appeared to read.</p>\n<p>Upon booting the Not Even Human (NEH) cartridge, the technical team noted that the laboratory C64's operating system was replaced by the alien cartridge ROM and it seemed to load some sort of battle simulation. The report shows that the purpose and meaning of this has been argued over for years and even today remains unclear. Are the aliens preparing us for war? Is it a simulation showing how their species functions? Or is it in fact merely a child's toy, highlighting the alien's perception of human civilisation to be in its infancy.</p>\n<p>Whatever the meaning, one thing was for sure. Not Even Human was fun.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000's, after no further contact from the alien civilisation, NASA was forced to mothball the NEH project due to increasing government budget cuts. After experiencing the NEH simulation first-hand, Dr. Wendt decided to continue work on the project in his own time, dedicatedly analysing and duplicating the machine code bit by bit from the alien ROM and translating wherever possible.</p>\n<p>Finally, after releasing his interpretation of the data for other Commodore users to experience in 2008 (much to the US Government's displeasure), it was decided that the program should really be presented to the public in the same format in which it was originally discovered.</p>\n<p>In 2011, after a long legal battle and many failed US Government attempts to 'silence' the project, RGCD and Onslaught are proud to present the official Not Even Human (Inhumane Edition).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T05:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/5943b018edddd9df246bb5c1676f32ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OnslaughtGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
