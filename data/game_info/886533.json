{"id": 886533, "slug": "master-of-hurry-on", "name": "Master of Hurry-On", "name_original": "Master of Hurry-On", "description": "<p>Conquer the universe... in 20 seconds!<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by classic 4X games like Master of Orion and Stellaris and created for the #20SecondGameJam, Master of Hurry-On is a super-condensed experience of interstellar conquest. Build an empire by clicking your mouse as fast as possible - you only have 20 seconds!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You start with one star. Your empire has a fleet size (shown in the top right) and a growth rate that will refill your ships every year. You play from 2200 AD to 2400 AD, for 20 seconds total, so 10 years per second. Click on an unconquered star to attempt an invasion. Each star has a fleet to defend it which will fight your full military might. There's a battle cost and an attrition cost that increases the bigger your empire and the further from your borders the star. If your fleet is strong enough to win with some ships left, you conquer it, adding its fleet capacity and growth to yours. If your fleet gets destroyed, you lose. Make as big an empire as possible in 20 seconds!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>The game was made with Godot 4. All sprites, music and resources are made by me, except for the font, which is Press Start by Cody \"CodeMan38\" Boisclair (cody@zone38.net). <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81da73ba124eb3d08b3bec85c6b2165d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lightcone Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
