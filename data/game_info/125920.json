The orb can be detached from the pilot's cockpit in order to block enemy fire and particles and solve puzzles.\u00a0If the cockpit has the orb linked, it will move slower but jump higher, and if it's detached it will move faster but jump at lesser heights.</p>\n<p>If the pilot gets hit with the orb linked it will detach itself automatically. Once detached, if the pilot gets hit agian the orb will fall to the ground and, since the cockpit has no way of powering itself without the orb link, it will stop working within 5 seconds if the orb is not retrieved, so be quick!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made by:</p>\n\n<p>@Alberto_vgdd</p>\n<p>@hipergravido</p>\n<p>@Shutupjonatan</p>\n<p>@Iumadatraca</p>\n<p>@aurepuerta_dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b22eb68ecb1c8a4cd204a8f2c0506d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Israel Nebot"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
