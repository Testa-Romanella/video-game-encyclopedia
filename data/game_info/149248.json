Instead of making a diorama or something like else, I wanted to combine my hobby and my education. I got it approved by my teacher and I went through with it. I also submitted it for a Spring game contest, which required my game to have a story.</p><p>I made all the graphics and music. Most of it sounds and looks terrible! This was my first time making a 3D game in Game Maker.</p><p>It comes with a level editor and an unnecessary scoring system.</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>A puzzle game like sokoban that you have to push all the blocks onto spaces. I made Moaiban, an Easter Island themed game. The ancient islanders made giant stone statues called Moai and pushes them up onto platforms called Ahu. I thought it would be cool to combine these ideas. Has 60 levels, a level editor, and can save up to 10 slots!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee2/ee2f7abb6deb3ca3bc36545ae9d1ae24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Warrer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
