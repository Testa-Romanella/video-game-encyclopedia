You find yourself alone with a murder suspect in hotel room 237 and begin interrogating<br/>him, asking him questions about his involvement with the murder and if he knows anything that might be useful.\u00a0<br/><br/>After a few minutes of his interrogation, he begins to grow increasingly agitated and asks if he can use the bathroom. You guide him to the bathroom and<br/>step away to look at some of the beautiful artwork that hang from the walls of the room. Suddenly, you hear the sound of a heavy metal object slowly<br/>scraping the tile in the bathroom. This, obviously, peaks your interest so you walk towards the wall and put your ear on it to try to understand what<br/>is making this sound.<br/><br/>The very second your ear makes contact with the wall there is a loud crunch as an axe tears a hole through the bathroom door, leaving wood shards everywhere<br/>on the floor directly in front of the door and you speechless as to what is happening. The suspect's head emerges through the door and looks directly at you.<br/>With murder in his eyes he yells, \"Heeere's Johnnny!!\", as your heart sinks to your stomach.<br/><br/>He tears the rest of the door down with his axe and begins walking towards you. Loud footsteps are all you hear as you run for your life through the hotel,<br/>making your way to safety as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>Created with\u00a0https://tjxx.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T04:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fcac6c7c45e55fe1c2fd9335e3e68d40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gatitostudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
