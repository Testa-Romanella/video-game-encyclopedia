Quickly choose the skill you need<br/>in order to revive your ally's HP, raise the effectiveness of their abilities, <br/>and dictate the flow of battle in real time.<br/> <br/>Another important role is advising your ally which opponent they should attack next.<br/><br/>Gather items and resources for crafting. Level up to become stronger, as you fight <br/>your way through increasingly strong monster tiers. Some monsters will surprise you<br/>with their bizarre attacks!<br/><br/>However, you do not have time to defeat all your enemies. There is only a limited<br/>number of torches for lighting up the dungeon, and you must make your way to the<br/>next tier before they burn out. A red ball item which can be found at each tier will<br/>help you save time. When you use it, the Knight will unleash a single, powerful <br/>attack which will take care of all remaining enemies! Only, enemies defeated with<br/>this attack will not relinquish any items or experience points. It takes more than<br/>a day to become a professional Knight or Priest, after all.<br/><br/>\u30fbAnnihilate the enemies with your Special attack!
