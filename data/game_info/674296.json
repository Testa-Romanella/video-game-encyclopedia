The goal is to dominate the opposition through either acquisition or destruction, so observation should be your prioritization! With a view of the entire stage the whole time, you can choose to close the gap on your opponents or keep your distance as you collect energy.<h3>A New Spin On Celebration</h3><br/>Taunting and doing post-fight finishing moves is always an awesome part of any game... But it never really matters, you know? Well it does now! Low on energy? Taunt to bring it up! Just take down another player? Do a finishing move on them for a huge reward! Careful though, because while doing either you'll be vulnerable to attacks, so choose wisely.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Turning Customization Up To 11</h3><br/>What's the point of having your very own little robot dude if you can't make him look exactly how you want? From hats to shoes and everything in-between, we want to give you the freedom to make your character yours. We'll be consistently updating the store with more items and animations for you to pick from!<h3>Much More Coming Around!</h3>Team play, additional game modes, clothing, taunts, finishers, you name it! Literally, if you can think of something to make this game even more awesome, leave a review, post something in the discussions or drop by our Discord server and let us know. We'll be happy to consider adding, remove or adjust anything that might make things better!<h3>We can't think of any more puns :(</h3>You might say... We've come full circle?
