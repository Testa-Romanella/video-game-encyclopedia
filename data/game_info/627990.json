I was inspired by Lonk's Adventure and wanted to make my own 2D Adventure game.<br/><br/>I plan to add more npcs, houses, dialogue and a few items to hold and interact with. If I get time, some background images and sky as well.<br/><br/>I plan to have several different endings, each ending will unlock a unique dialogue to go with it. Inspired heavily by Lonk's Adventure!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18f5c6370e40173287ba5b650a5a6bf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Deus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
