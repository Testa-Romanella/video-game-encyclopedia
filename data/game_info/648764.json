You can collect the junk food to gain weight or eat healthy food or take exercise to lose it. As the levels progress, it becomes more of a tactical choice.</p>\n<p>If you are too fat, then you may not be suitable for walking on fragile glass. If you are too skinny, then you may not have a chance to knock down more bowling balls in the end. What you have to do is learn to find a balance between the two.</p>\n<p>For example, sometimes you need to avoid those tasty but BAD hamburgers,feed on vegetables and get through the obstacles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:41:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294fe03b4a2250fea2e0d2a6a93cce09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["emaluaen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
