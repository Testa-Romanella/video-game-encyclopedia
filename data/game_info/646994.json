I was inspired at the time with Elite Dangerous and the original battlefront 2 space mechanics. <br/></p>\n<p>The project grew and I had plans to add narrative but I eventually lost steam for this project and so I am leaving it here to use what I have learned in a different project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game consists of 3 areas, Jupiter, Neptune and Mars. Mars (red Gate) shows off the Ai system with a 6 vs 6 Space Battle the other 2 don't do much but it was for testing scene transitions.</p>\n<p>The flight controls\u00a0 were adapted from here - https://github.com/brihernandez?tab=repositories if people were interested!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T05:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0eacdffecf832d885535de68b55875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaffaPearl"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
