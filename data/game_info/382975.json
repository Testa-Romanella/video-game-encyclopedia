{"id": 382975, "slug": "river-boy", "name": "River Boy", "name_original": "River Boy", "description": "\"WAAAAAAAH\" - A kappa (probably)\r\n<p>This was a submission for the first ever MixAndGameJam. The theme was \"Dimension Change\"- which meant to take one game mechanic and realize it in another dimension (3d to 2d or 2d to 3d). In the nostalgic vein of MixAndJam, I decided to take a mechanic from the very first game I ever played in my life: Super Mario Sunshine.</p>\n<p>I didn't get very far in the actual design of the game\u00a0(I got stuck having too much fun in ShaderGraph lol), but all\u00a0most of the mechanics I wanted got in there! Water spittin, hovering, cleaning...</p>Controls:<p>Move : WASD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aim\u00a0: Mouse</p>\n<p>Spit\u00a0: Left Click</p>\r\nWill I keep workin' on this?\r\n<p>I had a ton of fun this weekend, but I'm probably done workin' on this little guy for now hah..</p>\n<p>Big shoutout to\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Cardoso @andre_mc! Definitely go watch his channel for some awesome devvy wonders.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4d312c1f19cf64c9a27abf5a50f9cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SugarSores"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
