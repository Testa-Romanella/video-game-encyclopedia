It was developed by Japanese company Compile and released on February 23, 1996 in Japan only as both the last Mega-CD game released in Japan and the last game released anywhere on the Mega-CD/Sega CD.<br />\nThe game has a 1990s manga-based visual style loosely based on a contemporary Japanese manga series which was based on the Shadowrun franchise. Unlike the other Shadowrun video games which are set in Seattle and surrounding areas, this game is set entirely in Japan. In the fictional Shadowrun setting, Japan maintains a practice of exiling all orcs and trolls; thus there are no characters of those races in this game. The combat system is turn-based, and six-sided dice appear rolling on the screen determine the results of combat\u2014the conflict resolution system used in the Shadowrun table-top game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c8e3d2f844f8ed4e71544b214b7b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["SEGA CD"], "developers": ["Compile"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Compile"], "esrb_rating": null}
