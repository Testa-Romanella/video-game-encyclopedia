It is the product of the Gamocracy project, in which The Bearded Ladies invited the PlayStation\u00ae community forum members to design a game. The result is an awesome platformer with some very unique game mechanics and colorful characters.<br/>\r\nIn true Gamocracy spirit here is the salespitch from one of the forum members :\r\n<br/>\r\nHave you ever considered what it\u2019d be like to throw your own head off and use it as a platform or weapon? How about turning your arms into energy canons and magnets? In Legend of Robot you can do all of these things!\r\n<br/>\r\nIt\u2019s evident that some of you DO think about these things, because you\u2013 the best and brightest of the community, designed it!\r\n<br/>\r\n- Vincent Pavey\r\n<br/>\r\nDownload this unique game now and keep on the lookout for future gamocracy projects for your chance to design a game!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAll rights reserved to Ayeware AB 2011\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
