Please note: this game has been made for Chrome and Firefox only. </em><br/></p>\n<p>Zoo Tyc00n 2032 is a satirical take on the tycoon video game genre. You're an eager entrepreneur, with a million dollar loan from your father in tow, on your way to set up the zoo of your dreams. There\u2019s only one problem: the rapidly warming world (due to global climate change) is making it all, just, very... annoying for you. In fact, everything around you \u00a0is literally on fire as you strive to create a zoo to end all zoos! Wow! This is totally fine!</p>\n<p><strong>T/W, this game involves: climate change, Trump tweeting, the fact that extreme wealth won't save anyone from climate disaster.</strong></p>\n<p>A game by Cassie McQuater, 2018.<br/></p>\n<p>This is version 1.0.</p>\n<p>Future updates to add enemies, more complex interactions, fix bugs, ect. is possible.</p>\n<p>Please don't let this be the game I am remembered for, lol. It's...jokes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2e37eded84c7b60274320f9791570bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cassie McQuater"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
