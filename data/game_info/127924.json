With the help of the Internet, his quest turned into a live-action adventure game, and he got out.</p><p>As part of Udemy's Learn to Code by Making Games course - specifically Section 2, where we make text adventure games - I recreated Ryan's journey, with some artistic license.</p><p>In the future I would like to add music and change the images depending on the scene. Also I need to make a way to quit the game. </p><p>I'm really new to coding in Unity/C# so this was a pretty big step! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9dc76e091e2829519817e471fb4da88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Creatrix Tiara"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
