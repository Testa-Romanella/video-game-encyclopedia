I would have worked on more aesthetics and a menu system, but at the time of uploading this, it is 4:10 AM with 8 hours remaining, and school starts in 3 hours. This was fun, and a learning experience! I hope you enjoy smashing things in my game :)</p>\n<p>(PS! This was my first time building in APK so I also attached a .zip\u00a0 file for the PC build as well, just in case anything goes wrong)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5ecd8c9e2afb7c5064e622f811d3663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["h6n3y"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
