Throughout our journey, we've held a deep fascination for exploring topics like dark matter, alternate dimensions, multi-dimensional spaces, parallel worlds, the unknown, UFOs, extraterrestrial beings, and more. We've always wanted to turn our ideas into a game. After extensive planning and refinement, we are excited to introduce our brand new game, also our debut work, \"Encounter.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game's storyline combines elements of Chinese horror with encounters with extraterrestrial beings. It features innovative processes and gameplay. In this game, you'll experience how to interact with extraterrestrial beings, the connection between your character and the plot, and fulfilling tasks required by the alien entities. For instance, you might use a camera to capture unseen substances and then decrypt the elements after placing them in designated spots. There's also the use of an energy-absorbing gun to charge energy blocks in specific locations, thus unraveling the mysteries of the plot. Additionally, you might need to gather specific items and place them in a certain location to unlock the progression of the storyline.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is enriched with a plethora of eerie atmospheres, allowing players to experience supernatural visuals and sounds that evoke a distinct sense of horror. We hope you enjoy this unique terror experience!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeel free to share your thoughts with us. In our upcoming projects, we might just incorporate your invaluable suggestions!<br/>\r\nOfficial QQ Group\uff1a<br/>\r\n878740232 <br/>\r\n805714158<br/>\r\n115906915<br/>\r\nHello everyone, we are the developers of the game \"Encounter.\" This is our first work, and it's just the first chapter. We are deeply passionate about extraterrestrial themes, combining some dreamy and bizarre stories from folklore. The first chapter of the game may have many shortcomings because it's developed by just two of us. We welcome you to report any issues or bugs you encounter during gameplay in our group, and we will update them promptly. We also welcome any feedback and suggestions from all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the upcoming second chapter, we will spend more time completing the rest of the story involving the journalist and his wife, as well as the connection between the aliens and them. Thank you for your support and recognition!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo help you understand our storyline better, we've provided a brief summary: In order to facilitate your understanding of the plot, we've roughly outlined it. We draw inspiration from the Roswell incident, where a female nurse, while caring for the extraterrestrial being from Roswell, communicated with it after being on the same frequency. This extraterrestrial being informed her that there is a shared territory from which they originate, and Earth is a prison where they were exiled. There are 3,000 people on Earth, all of whom were exiled here by the extraterrestrials. Over time, they acquired human genetics, but half of them still have alien attributes within them, although they are unaware of it. Furthermore, the universe is in constant warfare, and Earth is protected by a barrier called the \"Spiritual Web,\" where the souls of the deceased are trapped in a cycle, unable to remember their past lives and unable to escape because Earth is a prison.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we have created our own story: When Jake is taking care of his pregnant wife, a portal opens in their home. Jake enters it, and the extraterrestrial beings lead him through a consciousness transfer procedure (also known as mind transplantation or consciousness transfer surgery). Jake starts to experience discomfort and goes to the hospital for examination. The extraterrestrial being is a reptilian, so Jake's CT scans show signs of \"evolution,\" such as vertical pupils, during this process. Jake is mostly unaware of these changes, but he feels as if something is slowly growing at the back of his neck, experiences frequent headaches, and has dreams that are actually his own experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring this time, Jake's wife goes into labor, and she has asthma. Jake wins a lottery ticket after buying a TV (this is actually a subconscious message from another extraterrestrial trying to enter Jake's wife's body, which means that the child in Jake's wife's body is their extraterrestrial offspring). When Jake brings his wife back home, he asks if she likes their new home. During this period, Jake's discomfort and hospital visits are explained as a gradual transfer and evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut why do extraterrestrials transfer themselves into humans? It's because they find Earth beautiful and consider it the last \"safe haven\" in the entire universe, as other star systems are in constant turmoil, aligning with what the Roswell extraterrestrial told the nurse about universal conflicts. Earth is, in fact, a safe place. So when Jake finds his wife, his mindset changes from anxiety to complete acceptance of the evolution. He decides to destroy all physical evidence of their \"previous lives,\" which is actually their intention. They have completely transferred and evolved through all genetic material via consciousness transfer, inhabiting human bodies as mere shells, while their souls, Jake and Qing, naturally go to the Spiritual Web where they await their next reincarnation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe younger brother was dealt with by \"Jake\" due to the need to eliminate witnesses, and his ashes are preserved by Jake, hinting at this reason. The journalist's fate is similar to the younger brother's (but it's left as a suspense for the players). In the final ending, Jake learns that the journalist has a pregnant wife, which parallels Jake's own situation. So, they will go to find the journalist's family, which may lead to murder to eliminate witnesses, another opportunity for extraterrestrial transfer, or a plot twist, setting up possibilities for the second chapter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T04:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/841f7ad14ec0db03173e16522afd3bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u7ea2\u95e8\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4(RedDoorStudio)"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u7ea2\u95e8\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4(RedDoorStudio)"], "esrb_rating": null}
