Every aspect of this game comes from experience.  Overall we have kept our personal opinions at a distance but we feel confident that there are enough clues in the dialogue options to show where we stand. <br/> <br/> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5e9a7700b8bcdcd011f033467839a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Glamow"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
