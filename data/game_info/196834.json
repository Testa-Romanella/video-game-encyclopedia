Prompt: games you hate.</p>\n<p>We were challenged to draw inspiration from a type of game we don't normally like. This game is attempt to make a competitive walking simulator. It is a (tongue-in-cheek) exploration of whether exploration itself can be a primary competitive mechanic.</p>\n<p>Players must gather points by navigating around the environment and observing their surroundings. The only actions involved are walking and looking. Walk close enough to a tree to look at it, then look at it until its leaves fall off to gain points. Walk too quickly, and you'll be met with a point penalty, as well as a scolding message and an unpleasant sound. Outwalk your opponent to victory!</p>\n<p>Best played with controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b0126e247c02457c550d1c2028bf0bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Costrell"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
