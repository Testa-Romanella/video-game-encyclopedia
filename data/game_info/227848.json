The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming elements TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I also want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any indie developer could dream of. if you have feedback about the Conflict-Series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth conversion without all the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not very sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if somebody has posted a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will answer to it as soon as I'm online.
