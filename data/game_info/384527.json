The fact is that the design of the locations, including the first, is still being finalized, and the saves from the previous version may not correspond to the new one.<br/><br/>Current build. This is the current state of the game, which I update very often. Added a new item / resource - updated. A new boss appeared in a new location - updated. New music, new game modes, etc. Those who have access to the full version get updates instantly. The full current version is the web version.
