Use the bombs to eliminate padlocks as soon as possible, allowing the Snaptox above to continue falling.<br/>- the 'bomb' removes the Snaptox and special pieces around it.<br/>- the 'radiation' removes all special pieces from the screen.<br/>- the 'clock' speeds up the frequency with which Snaptox fall, which increases the difficulty level.<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Infinite levels<br/><br/>- Multiplayer mode (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T14:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff5f54d90d95c1cdb470ab7e25d20340.jpg", "website": "http://www.odasoft.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Meme"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Meme"], "esrb_rating": null}
