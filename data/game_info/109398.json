After finishing I realised I had a full game that people would enjoy and could release. \u00a0It is made in Python using the Tkinter library which is very rare for games. Since I have not used an engine, it may lack some polish. But I hope you still enjoy it, thanks for downloading :) ~ Jonathan Alderson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb830613a00477abafebd517c631dab3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonathanAlderson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
