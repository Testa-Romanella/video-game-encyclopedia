At this time, the hottest of the year, thousands of animals return to the same beaches where they were born years ago to reproduce. However this year right after the mating, instead of going back out to sea, they went in the opposite direction heading straight into a small seaside town. Oswaldo, a newly licensed ambulance driver, was faced with the whole situation and decided to help out on his own. Upon arriving in the city center, he already came across some animals lost in the streets, sidewalks and squares. What he didn't realize was that there were police officers interested in smuggling the turtles. Police Captain Walter Branco, the most respected and toughest police officer in the small town, ordered the entire police battalion to go after the \"mistress.\" Knowing that if there is any kind of collision with the vehicles, Oswaldo must flee and capture all the turtles so that he can release them back to their home.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c77086b970cd570a166bccd0c64b1a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dino_Sauro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
