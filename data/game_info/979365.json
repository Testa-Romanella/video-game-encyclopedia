{"id": 979365, "slug": "aperture-2", "name": "Aperture", "name_original": "Aperture", "description": "The protagonist of the story enters a ruthless corporation that exploits its employees to the brink, living a life brainwashed by the company, working overtime into the night. Under such conditions, she becomes mechanical and numb, her heart filled with oppression and confusion. On a night that seemed no different from any other, the office suddenly experiences a power outage. The appearance of \"Aperture\" on the desk, a voice from the other end of a mysterious tape recorder, glowing fragments scattered around, and the company, empty yet fraught with danger, all seem bizarre and odd, as if this place is no longer the familiar company, or has she entered another dimension? Should she escape this \"place\" or numbly return to her office? This \"journey\" appears not to be as straightforward as it seems...<br/><br/><br/><ul><li><h3>Make proper use of Aperture's abilities to move forward</h3></li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><h3>Various forms of mazes</h3></li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><h3>Collect the lost fragments of memory</h3></li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><h3>Another voice</h3></li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><h3>Fun mini-game</h3></li></ul><br/><br/><br/><strong>A microcosm of the subconscious, the contradiction between the inner self and reality.</strong><br/><br/>The fast pace of modern life, work stress, and the emergence of negative emotions permeate everyone's lives. Inspired by this, we exaggerate it to present a world that seems both real and like a figment of the human imagination.<br/>In the game, everything is based on real objects and events that occur in the protagonist's life, mixed with her inner emotions and subconscious, thereby deriving a projection of the inner self in reality. We aim to materialize the protagonist's depression and confusion, as well as her journey to break through constraints, reclaim the beautiful moments within, and the process of healing her inner self.<br/>This is not an easy or healing journey; on the contrary, it is filled with failure, avoidance, confusion, and oppression. The choice to move forward, stay in place, or get lost in the maze is left to the players to decide.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T06:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a91eb78b51c7c6e72e6aa6d95e068d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enigmapulse Games ,LLC"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Enigmapulse Games ,LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
