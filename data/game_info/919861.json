In this 4 vs 4 couch game, you play as a shroom, mounting other characters in a race to be the first to claim victory. Inspired by the classic arcade hit, Killer Queen, Shroom Siege offers three unique ways to win - Military Victory by killing the Queen three times, Economic Victory by spreading your spore across the map, and Slug Victory by moving your slug into your own goal. The twist? You can't perform any actions without first mounting the Queen, a worker, or a warrior. So get ready to strategize, coordinate with your teammates, and mount your way to victory in Shroom Siege! The game works best with a controller, so grab your friends and let the fun begin!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Controller:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A - Jump</li><li>B - Mount</li><li>\u00a0Stick - Move\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard Player 1:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Shift - Mount</li><li>WASD - Move\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard Player 2:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Right CTRL - Jump</li><li>Right Alt - Mount</li><li>Arrow Keys - Move\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Works with combination keyboard and controller too!
