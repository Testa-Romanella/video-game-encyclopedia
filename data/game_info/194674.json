To prevent yourself from shrinking to death, you'll need\u00a0<strong>Size Stars.</strong> They'll help you grow you and will help you from shrinking. But shrinking isn't the only thing you should avoid. There are <strong>missiles</strong>, too and while growing, the ground can collapse. To protect yourself, you'll need to be bigger than the size of 20 pixels. To help you track your size, there is a blue bar to show how big/small you are. If you're bigger than 20 pixels, you can launch 2 chunks of yourself at the direction of left and right. These chunks will destroy the\u00a0<strong>missiles</strong>. To escape, you'll need 10000\u00a0<strong>Size Stars</strong>. That seems a lot, but don't worry; the game will save your\u00a0<strong>Size Stars</strong> until you leave the game. Once you have enough, there'll be a white door that lets you escape. What will happen next? You'll find out at the end. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/564c53904659570fa8aa46a843463615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Michael Swan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
