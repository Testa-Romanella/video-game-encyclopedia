With limited energy at your disposal - and limited windows to strike your opponent - you must carefully balance your spacecraft's offensive and defensive capabilities. Will you sacrifice your shields for an all-out assault, or will you have to divert energy from your super weapon at the last second to fend off an attack? Maybe you can even trade your orbital high ground for faster energy gains?\r\n</p>\n<p>For every orbit completed, each player earns additional energy points that can be used to power up weapons, defenses, and special abilities. Because systems take time to come online and there's never enough energy to go around, every moment is a struggle between dueling desires. Choose carefully, but beware. Even the best laid plans can blow up in your face like a missile out of the black!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ea574e85c3cf02edcce6f1b3d0d2216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rumor Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
