The players' objective is to turn all white and light blue blocks to dark blue by touching them. Both players have to touch a block before it turns dark blue, and the end only appears when all blocks are dark blue. <strong>Colorous</strong> has 10 levels, 2 of which are boss levels, being harder to complete than regular levels. What happens when you finish level 10? Well, we don't want to spoil the secret! Play the game now to get angry, and <em>never</em> finish.
