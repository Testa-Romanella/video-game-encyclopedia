The theme of the game jam was inspiration, which meant you were to make a game that was inspired by a person, place, or thing.\u00a0I chose California due to its almost year long summer heat which may or may not be an exaggeration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W - Move up.</p>\n<p>A - Move left.</p>\n<p>S - Move down.</p>\n<p>D - Move right.</p>\n<p>Move Mouse - Aim<br/></p>\n<p>Hold Left or Right Mouse Button\u00a0- Shoot</p>\n<p>Left Shift or Space - Dash (Invulnerable)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc679da3d6c3fee601764307f87f453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ClaytonWasTaken"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
