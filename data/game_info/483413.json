This is my first ever game jam.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to get to the highest floor you can. Each level is randomly generated and a yellow portal is placed on the level, This will take you to the next floor.</p>\n<p>Each floor you move up the enemies get harder, they receive more HP and deal more damage.</p>\n<p>There is a small chance you will be ported to a shop so you can spend your hard earned coins on upgrades, Plus there are treasure chests scattered around the maps that are guaranteed to have an upgrade in them.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left mouse click - Melee attack</p>\n<p>Right mouse click - Ranged attack</p>\n<p>Q - Potion</p>\n<p>I'm really pleased with what i managed to accomplish in 48 hours and i'm surprised at how much I know about game development.</p>\n<p>There are a few things more I would have liked to add if i had more time, Like more enemy variants and bosses, Plus more areas to go to and explore.</p>\n<p>Thank you for trying out my game and any feedback is much appreciated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82dd76243cafa26aea916d63351a31a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nozpher"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
