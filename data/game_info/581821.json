Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move around and use the \"/\" key to use runes you've picked up to banish your foes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Game for Love</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Darkrune is Porchlight Game's submission to Games For Love's first Game Jam: Game JAM For Love I: Pixel Arcade. For this Jam, we needed to create\u00a0an arcade-style game which could potentially be ported into a another VR game and played as if it were on its own arcade cabinet. We had a lot of fun creating this tiny game, and we hope you enjoy it, too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66d/66d416e6cdf7a455a088f780f29900a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porchlight Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
