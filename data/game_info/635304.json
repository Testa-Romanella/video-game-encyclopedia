Play as May, a survivor living in a bunker in the mountains that must go on a quest to find medicine for her sickly brother, Jack. In her way, she will meet the robots designed by the AI to hunt down humanity, an assembly of war machines who will not hesitate to kill her on sight. Her only way to survive will be to stay in the shadows and remain undetected, using her environment as cover.<br/><br/>May has a tool that allows her to interact with various devices along the town: opening doors, powering generators, finding hidden information and crafting various objects that will help her along the way by distracting her enemies, revealing them or and even incapacitating them.<br/><br/>In this slow-paced adventure game, the bleak setting and narrative create a tense and oppressive atmosphere that enhances the experience. May\u2019s vulnerability only adds to the feeling of helplessness against the war machines: if she is found, it\u2019s GAME OVER.
