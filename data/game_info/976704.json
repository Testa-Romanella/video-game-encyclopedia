In return, it promises to share the way for you to achieve what you seek. What could this devil possibly know?<h3>Join a unique story.</h3><br/><br/>You opened your eyes in a land you didn't know where it was, your memory was almost empty. What were you going to do? Did you have a dream, a purpose? Why were you here? So, what happens now?<br/>A unique book with its story translated into 11 different languages.<br/>Complete the missing pages in the storybook and find yourself!<br/>If you judge by the thickness of the book, yours is not the only story in this book.<br/><br/><br/><strong>-COMBAT-</strong><h3>DETAILED COMBAT SYSTEM</h3><br/><br/>Evolve in a completely different direction each time with 70 unique special bonuses. If pushing, poisoning enemies, or stealing HP doesn't catch your interest, try throwing them around, blinding them, or setting them on fire! Or if the enemy is stunning you too much, it seems like you need more stun resistance!<h3>EPIC BOSSES</h3><br/><br/>At the end of each map, you'll encounter a unique boss monster. Each boss has its own special abilities and stats. While some can inflict high magical damage and stun, another might deal much higher rates of critical physical damage! Yes, bosses generally deal high damage, and the best defense is definitely not getting caught by their abilities.<h3>PVP MODE</h3><br/><br/>Do you want to showcase your strength against your team members? If both you and your team have PVP modes active, you can inflict damage on each other. Sometimes, PVP is a good way to demonstrate who's better.<br/><br/><br/><strong>-GAMEPLAY-</strong><h3>RPG THINGS</h3><br/><br/>As you level up, enhance your passive abilities. Passive abilities are like a gamble\u2014the higher your luck, the faster you improve your active skills accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>But that's not all!</strong><br/>Choose one of the 6 different classes and start the game.<br/>Hunt monsters, drop valuable items, or craft. Upgrade the level of your equipment, enhance your gear with bonuses and rune stones tailored to your chosen path and strategy, making it truly unique!<br/>Master at least one of the 5 different elements! Don't forget that your enemies might have mastered these elements too!<br/>Are the enemies too strong? Try to understand the element they've mastered and strike with its resistance! Remember that enemies may also have resistance against your element!<br/>And finally, don't forget to improve your stats\u2014they are crucial!<h3>Striking Maps</h3><br/><br/>From hot to cold, wet to arid, 6 unique and vast maps. While these maps may not be open worlds, it doesn't mean there are no hidden passages and surprises!<h3>Puzzles</h3><br/><br/>Each map has a puzzle that needs to be solved before delving into it. It's simple: solve the puzzle, unlock the gateway!<h3>Secrets</h3><br/><br/>In every map where monsters reside, there are 2 special chests, but finding them is definitely not easy! Some require a bit of parkour skill to reach, while others will have you delving into the map's most secluded corners. Or not \u2013 not everyone needs to discover these, only those seeking extra items and Steam achievements!<h3>No Loading Scene</h3><br/><br/>Of course, there is a one-time loading when you open the game, but afterward, you won't have to wait for any loading when changing maps, whether with your team or solo. Dealing with this system in multiplayer was incredibly challenging, but I managed to overcome it. I hope you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/><br/><strong>-HEY, ONE MORE THING!-</strong><h3>SOLO DEVELOPER</h3><br/><br/>This game has been developed by a single developer.Of course, I added details like models and drawings by purchasing services, but I am the sole active developer working on the project. Perhaps, this may not mean much to you. However, for me, it represents a tremendous achievement. I have fulfilled a dream. As a result of a lot of hard work, I hope you enjoy my RPG game 'Six Sides of Obscurity' that I have presented to you.<h3>-JOIN KOSIPPY ON DISCORD-</h3><br/><br/>If the game has caught your interest, if you want to follow its development, discuss anything related or unrelated to the game, or if you'd like to see other games we are working on (I hope not to develop them alone in the future), please don't forget to join our Discord channel!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T04:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/88385c198447d750207f281212c9d154.jpg", "website": "https://www.kosippy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kosippy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kosippy"], "esrb_rating": null}
