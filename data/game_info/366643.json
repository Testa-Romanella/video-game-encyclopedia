I know this isn't very accessible but I was not very smart with how I made this game.</p>\n<p>I made this after over a year of not doing any game dev so the project was honestly really thrown together. I just wanted to make SOMETHING so the results aren't great but I'm still glad I did it!<br/></p>\n<p>MADE FOR LOWREZJAM 2019 https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2019<br/></p><p>GITHUB: https://github.com/kvn-prhn/LOWREZJAM19<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/22037f6eab6ec5512e765eb1255a4a08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kvn-prhn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
