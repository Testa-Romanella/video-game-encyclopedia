Our goal is to successfully sort mass quantities of recyclables so we can transport them to their specialized country. Seems nice, right? There is a catch - once these countries receive capacity of recyclables, they have the right to turn away more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player must sort and recycle as many items as they can by placing them into their designated bins all within the allotted time frame. For each misplaced item as well as items left over the end of the level, these items will be sent to the landfill. As the player advances through the levels, different situations may occur to challenge the sorting process. Try to recycle at least 70% of the items to be as environmentally friendly as possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f9/2f9d406d3baff5cd81f44a1775f921ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nmiel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
