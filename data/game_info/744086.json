This version .001 is the debut of the past few months of effort going directly to envisioning the dream, merging known gameplay formulas into one distinct experience you won't find anywhere else.\u00a0 This amazing piece of interactive art is the first \"cel\" of our 'Survival Horror'\u00a0NFT portfolio allowing you to claim a one and only experience that everyone else only has 10 minutes for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All demos will only unlock the full experience with this one-time NFT\u00a0pass:</p>\n\n<p>InDenial Prototype Pass V0.01 (1 of 1)<br/></p>\n<p>To whoever purchases our NFT .001, it allows you access to all builds of this set from the first going forth, this also allows you to invest in us and succeed with us\u00a0as we carry forth the ideas we have behind this project. Our lock and key NFT mechanism allows you to drop the timer from the demos we upload here and allows you to\u00a0play the full version of the experience without restriction.\u00a0 We are only selling one, so you will be the only person who can access all 5 with your key. We are hoping that in this way, our digital art, and your one of a kind NFT,\u00a0really can maintain and gain value going forth to become a good investment.</p>\n<p>Our builds here are meant to entertain and show our\u00a0development process from conception, to prototype, to build and testing, then leave it to you, the public to influence our current direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first iteration of our survival horror NFT\u00a0series, we will host 4 more before making decisions on\u00a0this project.\r\n</p>\n<p>Next Iterative phase will contain known bug fixes, more animations, new enemy, new menu for inventory and controls,\u00a0new NFT .002, new event features, and aesthetic updates.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:\r\n</p>\n<p>-Moving during cutscenes.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Melee hit can pop player up in the air which can potentially cause unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>- Miscellaneous audio glitches, static sounds.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Picking up the gun deletes all the previously collected\u00a0ammo count, ammo bug.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T06:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e21f19637a675f9345d38247d3092baf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InDenial Game Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
