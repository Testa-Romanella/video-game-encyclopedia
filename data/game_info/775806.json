Squirrelton is trying to reach the top of the great tree to find the great Acorn(The Acorn will come in the next patch). The game was built using the 2Dplatformer class assignment as a baseline. and custom assets. The goal of the game is to simply make it through to the end and defeat the final boss.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Goal</strong> The game is very aesthetically driven, the goal was to use a variety of sound and level design to give a sense of beauty to the world. Our purpose was to create a beautifully aesthetic game. with music to match the environment. and gain interaction from the player when it comes to exploration. Our goal with the game was not game difficulty. merely a proof of concept of the things we could do with unity. These goals i think were met head on. the level design is hopefully intriguing and the use of lighting and music propel the games artwork.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs:</strong> Currently the game has several bugs, Including collision. where the character will occasionally get stuck. The damage foreground does not accurately affect player damage. These could have been fixed. but we found ourselves scrounging for time.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Workload;</strong> In general the game required a lot of man hours when it came to co-herent game design. \u00a0The pre-existing prefabs we had used particularly utilized the game managers, health scripts, and such. most of the time we had spent on this went into sound design, level building, and lighting. As well as rigging all of the different features.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Contribution</strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasmin:</strong> Music production using Fl Studio, level design, light design, platform placement, tilemap layouts, parallax script</p>\n<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Main player setup, designed reaper enemy, input system, menu system, game loop, player hud, github setup</p>\n\n<p><strong>Non-created assets:</strong> We primarily used the 2d Platformer assignment as a skeleton for this project due to the lack of time that both team members had to complete the term project.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Store assets:</strong> 2D Squirrel Character, RPG Worlds Caves, Platformer Fantasy Set 1, 2D platform tile-set - cave</p>\n<p><strong>Personally Developed Assets: </strong>Music, Enemy Art, Lighting Effects, End Game Pickups, Menu art.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>VIDEO LINK: <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:16:20", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JazzSW20"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
