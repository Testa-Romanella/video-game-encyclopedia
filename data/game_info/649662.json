Do what you can, Commander, to cripple or destroy the <strong>COM</strong> ship and bring <strong>TAC</strong> to victory!</p>\r\nProtect your Bridge and Engineering\r\n<p>In TacCom, your ship is comprised of multiple components such as your Bridge, Engineering, Sensors, Propulsion, Maneuvering Thrusters, and Ion Lance. The first two of these components are the most important. If either your Bridge or Engineering are destroyed, you ship will be crippled and considered destroyed.<br/></p>\r\nMessage from Author\r\n<p>TacCom is far from polished. There may be many bugs I was unable to remove. While the game is playable, how the game determines damage may not be obvious and victory (or defeat) may appear sudden. I do hope you enjoy the game for what it is, however, and thank you for playing!<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>The Options button on the main menu does nothing. Sorry.
