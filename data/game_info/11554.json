If considering a purchase, please be ready for a learning curve and challenging game play. <strong>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the game.</strong><br/><br/><br/>Combining the best of <strong>space combat</strong> and <strong>real time strategy</strong>. Victory can be<strong> tactical</strong>, a <strong>dogfight</strong> or <strong>capital ship slugging match</strong> - depending on how you decide to achieve it.<br/><br/>A desolate asteroid field on the edge of the solar system erupts in war. Your forces rely on you to take the battle to the enemy. Build up defenses and fleets, repair and upgrade your command ship, lead your forces to reclaim and conquer territory.Game play:The seat of a fighter, the bridge of a cruiser and a tactical battle map are your tools of war. Void Destroyer puts you in command and gives you ultimate freedom over the    your forces and the art of war.<br/><br/>If you ever wanted to directly control your forces in a real time strategy game or be able to build ships and command to your wing-men and fleets in a space combat simulator like you can in a RTS - this is the game for you. Void Destroyer combines elements from space combat simulators and real time strategy games. No longer are you limited on how to control and command. Battles are waged on your terms, you are given the tools. How you use them is up to you.<br/><br/>Jump into a fighter to engage in dogfights, then switch into a frigate to take out an enemy corvette. Build defensive platforms to augment the security of your base. Issue commands to your attack ships to distract enemy defenders to allow your marine frigates to board an enemy's base. Defend and oversee asteroid mining craft to have the resources necessary to support your fleets.<br/><br/>By combining elements of two genres, enemies can be more brutal, fights can be larger and you can overcome greater challenges.<br/><br/>Think there's not enough time?
