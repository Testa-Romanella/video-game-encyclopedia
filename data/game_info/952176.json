On the surface, they were a group bounded by teamwork and trust determined on accomplishing a feat no man has done before. In reality, these devious hikers all have one singular goal, to be the </em><strong><em>only</em></strong><em> person left.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>RULES :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1)\u00a0Players proceed up and down the mountain by snaking up the board. Arrive at the <strong>flag </strong>square and then proceed down the mountain <strong>bringing the flag</strong> back to the \u201c<strong>start\u201d </strong>or be the <strong>last player standing</strong> to win.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2)\u00a0</strong><strong>If the same number rolls on both dice ,players move forward or backward by the value of both dice added together.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3)\u00a0</strong><strong>Otherwise, the players must choose 1 die to <strong>move forward with and the other to move backward with</strong>, choose one direction to move in first (apply all movement modifiers), then move in the <strong>opposite direction </strong>(apply all movement modifiers). </strong></p>\n<p><strong>4)\u00a0Each player has <strong>3 lives</strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5) Players can \"injure\" other players by landing on the same spot as the other player. If this happens, the other player loses a life and gets sent back to the start. Losing all 3 lives eliminates you entirely from the game!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6) Players can also <strong>steal the flag by \"injuring\" the other player</strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>7)\u00a0</strong><strong>Players are invincible on the \u201cstart\u201d square.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MOVEMENT ADD ONS\u00a0:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) </strong><strong>Landing on a <strong><em>Supply Stop</em></strong>\u00a0 makes you move<strong> forward</strong>\u00a0:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The red supply drop moves the player\u00a0forward 2 spaces.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The yellow supply drop moves the player forward 3 spaces.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The blue supply drop moves the player forward 5 spaces.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Landing in a <em>Snowstorm</em> moves the player backwards :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The white snowflake moves the player backwards by 2 spaces.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The dark blue snowflake moves the player backwards by 3 spaces.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The yellow snowflake moves the player backwards by 5 spaces.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3ea8b7c9f688f6ecef86edd5d418794.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sahithya_Nulah"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
