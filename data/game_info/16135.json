{"id": 16135, "slug": "otherland-mmo", "name": "Otherland MMO", "name_original": "Otherland MMO", "description": "Otherland is an action-packed Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game based on Tad Williamss highly acclaimed novels. Embark on exciting adventures in a virtual multiverse with several diverse worlds ranging from fantasy to sci-fi. Built on the Unreal-engine, the Otherland MMO features beautiful graphics, action-based combat with direct controls, PVE and PVP, a rich storyline and complex RPG character development with four classes and numerous skills. The game\u2019s unique virtual reality setting brings several innovative features. The eDNA System, for instance, allows you to craft and clone both Items and NPCs to help you protect your virtual apartment or play a part in clan wars.<br/><br/><strong>A unique virtual universe</strong><br/>Otherland is a network of virtual worlds with completely different graphic styles! This allows for an incredible variety in landscapes, NPCs, outfits and weapons. Shop, trade or just hang out in the Bars of the futuristic Lambda Mall. Fight other players in the Hacker Zone, join the medieval war of EightSquared, uncover secrets on Mars, fight fearsome creatures on Bugworld or explore the Chinese-themed FiveIsles... Each world is filled with numerous quests, connected by a rich backstory presented as a sequel to the novels.<br/><br/><strong>Breathtaking Graphics</strong><br/>Visually stunning landscapes, gorgeous environments, smooth effects and incredibly detailed characters all created on Unreal Engine.<br/><br/><strong>Action-based Combat</strong><br/>Combat in Otherland feels more like an fighting in an action game than in a classic MMORPG. Aiming directly, moving with WASD and using your mouse to look around and control directions contribute to that feeling. Yet, you need to use Skills and Items wisely to defeat your enemies.<br/><br/><strong>Character Customization</strong><br/>Based on four classes, Otherland bursts with an astonishingly wide variety of character customizations. Heights from tiny to huge, morphologies going fromthin to muscular, and the ability to wear anything and everything you find will give you the chance to  find your own truly unique look in the Multiverse.<br/><br/><strong>Crafting</strong><br/>Every item and NPC in Otherland is made out of electronic DNA. After defeating opponents, players can extract their eDNA to gain unique recipes for items - or even NPCs themselves. This unique feature creates numerous options to customize players\u2019 looks and interact with the world. <br/><br/><strong>Player housing</strong><br/>Set in Lambda Mall, each player is given their own virtual home called USpace, which can be decorated and customized. USpaces are used to grow Soma, the game\u2019s main resource, and can be attacked by other players, leading to PVP encounters. Afraid to go on vacation? Collect eDNA from creatures and clone them to protect the USpace in your absence. <br/><br/><strong>Clans and Clan Wars</strong><br/>Found a clan with your friends!. Coming soon: Wage clan wars and choose to donate your eDNA creatures to your clan\u2019s own world: the Clan|Space. Expand your Clan|Space, explore and defend it! <br/><strong>Classes</strong><br/>4 Classes are available to the players.<br/>Warrior: This is as close to the classic tank as possible, specialized in strong close quarter abilities and high endurance. <br/>Assassin: The second close combat class in the game. Massive damage but low endurance make this class a glass cannon. <br/>Marksman: Their range advantage lets them keep their opponents away. A strong damage output with the safety of range makes this a survivor\u2019s class.<br/>Energizer: With its medium output of damage and average endurance, this class might not seem the best choice at first glance.  But their healing abilities make up for all other shortcomings.<br/><br/><strong>Business Model and Future DLC Plans</strong><br/>Otherland in Early Access is a Buy to Play game with optional free and paid DLC to be released over time. There are no micro-transactions at this point. The game features two currencies, bits and Credits. While bits are the main in-game currency which you can farm and earn through quests, credits are used for vanity items and currently in the game for testing purposes (given to players as a bonus). Again, the use of credits is optional, they can NOT be bought at this moment and you will be able to earn them through daily quests after the next big update.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21b48f2c734469db9ddf772d4f12e197.jpg", "website": "http://www.drago-entertainment.com/otherland/", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 174, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 670, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drago Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["otherland co-production"], "esrb_rating": null}
