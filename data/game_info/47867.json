It\u00b4s deadening &amp; Turbo Granny is bored to death! She misses all the action and excitement that she used to experience - a long time ago\u2026<br />\n\u2026 and that is why she one day has had it; Turbo Granny takes her mobility scooter and gets the h*** out the nursing home!<br />\nTurbo Granny is out of the slow home, now what? Where to go? She - thank God - has a decision to make (by herself\u2026), what direction to take?<br />\nLet\u00b4s free Turbo Granny!<br />\nANDROIDTAPP.COM<br />\nThe game is pure fun, presents quite the challenge, very hilarious to\u2026 well I\u2019ll just be insensitive and say it \u2014 watch Granny crash and break a hip! When I first played the game, I did not put it down for nearly 45 minutes\u2026 and that was only until the battery died. Honestly, Turbo Grannies is probably more fun than Angry Birds or its equal.<br />\n4,6 OUT OF 5<br />\nQWERTYHUB.COM<br />\nTurbo Grannies is a lot of fun, it has a great sense of humor, great style, great graphics, hilarious sounds, and is the first game I\u2019ve handed off to someone else to watch them try and beat my score.<br />\n4 OUT OF 5<br />\nSMOKINAPPS.COM<br />\nThe graphics look great and much attention has been given to detail. Gameplay is pretty flawless, controls respond well. All in all, it\u2019s a good, attractive game, you just need a bit of patience to get the hang of it.<br />\n4 OUT OF 5</p>\n<p>Little rusty there, Turbo Granny? If so, she could take the easiest way, the Mountain track. At the Mountain track there will be some off-road driving with quite a few nasty jumps on the way. In order to complete the track she\u00b4d better have a rally vehicle\u2026<br />\nEager to go, Turbo Granny? Then she should take the Suburbia track, it\u00b4s the best route for her to take - on her speedy vehicle\u2026<br />\nUp for a challenge, Turbo Granny? If it is a truly courageous Granny she should however opt for the Desert track. The Desert track is a really difficult cross track, in fact it is so difficult that if completed it is very doubtful that the nursing home staff will catch up with her - ever\u2026<br />\nTo make the most of this game, use your phones advanced features, such as touchscreen and gyroscope.<br />\nTo help Turbo Granny; lean back and forward on your cool mobility scooter as you climb the hills and fly through the air using accelerometer technology.<br />\nRead more on www.turbogrannies.com<br />\nWatch trailer on www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBHMKk1YNEM<br />\nMore games from Imperial Game Studio on www.imperialgamestudio.com<br />\nThis game is produced by Imperial Game Studio.
