{"id": 186747, "slug": "the-tale-of-lukas-demo", "name": "The Tale of Lukas - Demo", "name_original": "The Tale of Lukas - Demo", "description": "<p>Lukas is a traveler and archer whose past is shrouded in mystery. Not just for the people he meets, but for himself as well! All he knows is his name and how to fight.</p>\n<p>This is just a demo, and it's not very well-developed yet. There aren't many people and Lukas's memory loss doesn't come up at all except (barely) in his character description under 'status'.</p>\n<p>That said, I'm proud of my progress so far! I'll be updating the demo every now and then, and I'll keep this description page updated as well!</p>\n<p>Things I have added so far:</p>\n<p>-2 shops<br/>-3 characters besides Lukas who can be recruited<br/>-3 dungeons (one in Karsend, one by the tent guy, and the lagoon has the occasional minotaur so I'm counting it)<br/>-A total of 2 towns, one alchemist who lives on a hill, a gate that leads to a town that can't be accessed in this demo, a guy in a tent, and a lagoon</p>\n<p>Things I hope to add eventually:</p>\n<p>-At least 4 more recruitable characters (if I add any more than that, I'll turn off the ability to see everyone following Lukas because they'd just fill up the screen)<br/>-More dungeons<br/>-More towns, villages, a castle, etc.<br/>-More monsters (At the moment there are a total of five)<br/>-More maps (there's only one)</p>\n<p>Also, for the moment this demo is free. Once I've finished an entire game I will make a separate page and that WILL cost money. However, the final version of this demo will still be free. I'm not sure how much of the full game will be in that version, but the option to pay is here either way. The more people who buy this demo instead of downloading it for free, the less I'll price the full version! I understand if you want to download it for free for now since there's not much here, but when I add onto it a bit more I hope you'll consider paying a bit!</p>\n<p>This game was made with the help of RPGMaker MV!</p>\n<p>UPDATE #1: Whoo! New map already added! I also added some more dialogue and stuff to the first map (and I took out the fire floor in the tent's dungeon... Sorry about that), more recruitable characters, and Lukas's memory loss actually gets brought up now!</p>\n<p>UPDATE #2: I've added a new map and fixed a few things (namely the shops in Zirania and Anemna... Sorry about that, guys, haha...). The new map doesn't have much, but I'm still proud of what I managed to do. I plan to do something with that spooky forest there in the next update, as well as adding a new map.</p>\n<p>UPDATE #3: Added a new map, added the spooky forest (as promised) and added more recruitable characters! The new map includes one tiny town, one regular town, an empty summer house (aside from the recruitable character there) and another magic forest. I didn't get to do much in this one either but I'm still very proud of what I did do! The next update will be my last one for this demo, after which you'll have to wait for the full game!</p><p>UPDATE #4: I've added two maps to this update - one is to the south of the first map and the other is in the northeast. No new recruitable characters in this update. There's a new town, some new shops, etc. There's also the appearance of some new monsters - namely, spiders.</p><p>That's the last update for this demo! If you liked what I did, I hope you'll buy the full game when it's ready! Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb6/cb6621c284abd4935a0da0a4dcf7f39e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["personoffewtalents"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
