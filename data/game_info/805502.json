The player must fly from start point to finish point in the shortest possible time, collecting all checkpoints. The spaceship has two flight modes, maglev and zero-G. In zero-G, the ship can move freely in 360 degrees. In Maglev mode, the ship flies around a track, has limited movement up and down, and the ship \"rolls\" along with the track. Flying over the Maglev track gives a lot faster acceleration and top speed, making it usually better to fly over Maglev. Figuring out when it's faster to jump off the track and cut a piece is part of the game experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74b1ac9660aa86bdaa2297c9498ca78d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koelekikkers.nl", "mymy3"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
