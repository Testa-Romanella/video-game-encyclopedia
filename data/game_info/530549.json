{"id": 530549, "slug": "two-by-one", "name": "Two by One", "name_original": "Two by One", "description": "Have you ever wanted an extra gun to shoot down the enemies coming at you? A way to finish off the boss twice as fast? Or to cover twice as much of the screen in bullets? Then this game is made for you. But beware, because having twice the firepower also means having twice as many ways to get hit.<br/><br/>Two by One is a Shoot'Em Up that tasks you with controlling two ships simultaneously in order to progress. Enemies that would be invincible with a single ship become beatable with two. Threats that'd fill the screen with bullets disappear before they can shoot a single one.<br/>Yet at the same time you have twice as many ships to protect. A safe spot for one might not be safe for the other, and a hit on one means losing both of them.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can also bring along a friend and share the load, controlling one ship each. Just make sure you aren't making things even harder for each other.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>A challenge you haven't faced before</strong>: Hardcore stages that aren't just about beating them, but figuring out how to beat them.<br/></li><li><strong>Death is not a problem</strong>: Stages are short and respawns fast, so that death isn't a setback, but just a step in the path to victory.<br/></li><li><strong>Massive Bosses</strong>: Endurance runs where the question isn't whether you can dodge it or not, but for how long.<br/></li><li><strong>Style</strong>: Stylish graphics that stand out like black against a white background. Or the other way around.<br/></li><li><strong>Local co-op multiplayer</strong>: Bring a friend to help out and then make the bullets meant for you go in his direction.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T02:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afce7e3e13e97e3ec05a8996ae4c02ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Javier Ortega"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Javier Ortega"], "esrb_rating": null}
