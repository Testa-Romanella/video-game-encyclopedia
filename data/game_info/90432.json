Even though he dreams of becoming a famous artist\u00a0(whether in music, digital art, or writing is up to the player!), he currently works the graveyard shift at a run-down little diner.\u00a0<br/><br/>He's wry, tough, and determined by default, but his personality changes and grows throughout the course of the game!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Despite his intimidating appearance, Dominic prefers to keep to himself. A man of few words, he rarely offers\u00a0any insight into his thoughts, but his silence suggests a deep conflict going on beneath the surface.<br/></p>\n<p>Isaac reeks of \"unscrupulous businessman,\" and makes no effort to hide it.
