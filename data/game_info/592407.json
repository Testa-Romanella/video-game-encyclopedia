You can build construction sites, incompetent superheroes, unstable bridges, or a city filled with glass marbles. Best of all? This game has an online community, hosted on GitHub, where you can upload worlds, and play other players' worlds! There is also a small Discord community, where you can share links and worlds. This game is also on GameJolt, here. You can download other versions of the game there, such as the Mac version, or the Linux version.</p>\n<p>Music by Kevin MacLeod.
