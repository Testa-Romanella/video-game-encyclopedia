You have a clone which would mirror your movement. To fit into the jam's given limitation \"<strong>You Are Your Own Enemy\"</strong>, we made it so that the bullets shot by your clone could hurt you. And to follow the theme \"<strong>Colors\", </strong>the slimes you slay would burst into a spectrum of beautiful colors. There is no end goal, You play for as long as you could survive.\u00a0We hope you like this game. Thankyou!</p>\n<p>Credits: <br/>https://twohorns.itch.io/\u00a0 (Programmer &amp; Artist)</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/profile/justmax234 (Music &amp; SFX)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T17:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a426cf29c6e55f5ea23b7c7936b5ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TwoHorns"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
