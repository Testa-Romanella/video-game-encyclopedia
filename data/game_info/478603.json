It's a loose interpretation of the theme but the mechanic that came from it ended up being interesting to work with. Hope you have fun with the game!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Arrow keys or WASD to move.</p>\n<p>- Space bar to jump</p>\n<p>- Hold left or right against a wall while airborne to start a wall slide. You can jump out of a wallslide to gain height<br/></p>\n<p>- Z to throw your fireball and press Z again while it's out to call it back to you. It'll deal more damage if you hit multiple enemies in one throw, and it'll heal you when it returns if its damaged something too.<br/></p>\n<p>-While your fireball is out on the screen, you'll move faster and can double jump to help line up your shots, or simply to help you with platforming.<br/></p>\n<p>- You can press ESC to quit a level and return back to the menu<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d1c977c668f8735061544ec99db51ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BmeisterCD"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
