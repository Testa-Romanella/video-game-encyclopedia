You've been chosen to Sort letters at our primary facility in our glorious nation, Paska.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will first be sorting the same colour letter, but things will quickly get chaotic. You need keen sensors to detect invalid letters with features such as upside-down stamps, missing seals and invalid colour seals.</p>\n<p>Our nation has provided you with enhanced sorting technology, and you will come across several special letters capable of helping you sort through the mail.\u00a0 It will become harder the longer you sort.</p>\n<p>Bored of sorting through the letters sent by grandmas, the stories travelling over-seas? There are 38 Medals for you to collect. Get to work. (Dont worry, they will be saved!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ THE MANUAL, OR WE MAY HAVE TO TERMINATE YOUR POSITION AT THE COMPANY.</strong></p>\n<p>- Paska Post</p>\n\n<p>Produced by <strong>Tbage &amp; Rushork</strong> for the Brackeys 2021.2 Game Jam \"Let There Be Chaos\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e302e5f200274e748c0c8a0e1aad725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tbage"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
