{"id": 864552, "slug": "rude-bear-radio", "name": "Rude Bear Radio", "name_original": "Rude Bear Radio", "description": "<p>Rude Bear fell asleep listening to his radio, and it's playing all of your favourite songs! <br/>Every 10 seconds the radio station changes, and his hallucinations bring him to a new world. <br/></p>\n<p>There are 44 mini games in this game (8 game franchises, each having between 3 and 9 unique levels). If you like tough ones, you can go straight to practice mode and choose the bottom levels. RRRRRR, Super Rudio Bros and Bearo Wing have the toughest levels. <br/></p>\n<p>Rude Bear: Radio is the third in the Rude Bear series (which we make every Ludum Dare). Each game is completely different, other than having the same character. <br/> <br/>Guide Rude Bear through a series of 10 second minigames lasting 10 seconds, Wario Ware style. After 10 levels, you move up to medium mode, and 10 more onto hard. <br/></p>\n<p>On practice mode you can play any level of any game, mini-games included (in order of inception) are: <br/></p>\n<p>Rudegry Beards - Fire Rude Bear into The Wizards to defeat all of them before the time runs out using your mouse <br/></p>\n<p>Rude Bear Red - Help Rude Bear defeat wild monsters! <br/></p>\n<p>Rudey Island - Choose the correct insult to defeat bear guys. <br/></p>\n<p>The Rudecopter Game - Guide Rude Bear with his jackpack and look out for obstacles (space or left click to fly). <br/></p>\n<p>Bearo Wing - Rude Bear isn't safe anywhere! Help him fight off enemy spaceships. <br/></p>\n<p>Space InBEARders - What would a minigame collection be without multiple space games?! You know this one! <br/></p>\n<p>RRRRRR - Help Rude Bear to the checkpoint by reversing gravity with space and moving with the arrow keys/WASD. <br/></p>\n<p>Super Rudeo Bros. - Reach the axe to destroy the bridge and send The Wizard plummeting to his firey grave. <br/></p>\n<p>There's also a bonus stage every 10 levels Rude Bear Roulette! Click to win extra credits, but be careful... <br/></p>\n<p>The mouse is used for all games except Super Rudio Bros and RRRRRR, in which WASD and the keyboard are used. The game plays best with your hands on WASD and the mouse at all times. <br/></p>\n<p>Code and Audio by Alex Rose @alexrosegames</p>\n<p>\u00a0Pixel Art by Antony Dewar @panttts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf8ae5e2a457b6b4fce6369f35e1edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Rose"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
