It saves all the key mechanics from the first part and adds a lot of new ones. The combat system is no longer an extension of the classic Disciples. Now it is a completely independent and original game<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features a huge number of races, from the classic humans, elves and orcs, to much more rarely seen in games, such as lizardmen and ratmen. Characters are formed from 2 components - race and class, similar to my favorite D&amp;D system. This game has 25 character classes to choose from and 37 classes for neutral creatures. Each class has its own set of abilities, which significantly affects the gameplay<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to the adventure mode, the game has a strategy mode. In it you can build buildings and research technologies", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T02:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d51e31a0f380b5eea5ef523cfaeb8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 405, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ellinia games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ellinia games"], "esrb_rating": null}
