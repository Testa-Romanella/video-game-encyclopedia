This became the ingredient/recipe idea in linecook: specific ingredients are sometimes good and sometimes bad, depending on the current recipe. I also liked the chaos and time pressure caused by gravity in Arithmetic Bounce; I've gone for a slightly different but still chaotic spin by giving the player two grabber-claws that are a bit tricky to aim.</p>\n<p>I'm planning to write up\u00a0a blog post about the process of making this game, check pancelor.com sometime in the next few weeks if you're interested!</p>\n<p>#ChainLetterJam\r\n</p>\n<p>If nominated, you have two weeks to make a 1 minute game in some way inspired by the game that nominated you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once finished, put #ChainLetterJam in your game description, a link to the game that nominated you, and then nominate two other devs (or less or more, whatever, this isn't a chain letter where you die in three days if you don't).<br/></p>\n<p>All the previous games in this chain are:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>https://nartier.itch.io/wordman-saves-the-day\r\n</li><li>https://vimlark.itch.io/word-bounce\r\n</li><li>https://niborious.itch.io/word-bounce-3d\r\n</li><li>https://patrickgh3.itch.io/arithmetic-bounce\r\n</li><li>this game!</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75b/75ba500012490b6e5e1f31bc85c7a988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["pancelor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
