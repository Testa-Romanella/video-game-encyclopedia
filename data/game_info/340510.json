{"id": 340510, "slug": "triolink", "name": "TRIOLINK", "name_original": "TRIOLINK", "description": "<p>Inspired by other<strong> tile-matching</strong> classics, <strong>TRIOLINK</strong> is a game that shifts the focus from speed and timing to <strong>careful planning</strong>. As the game progresses, linking more pieces while maintaining the board clear will prove more difficult than it seems.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Drag the pieces on the right and drop them on the board. If you can no longer fit the pieces anywhere on the board, game over!</li><li>Form matches by linking three or more pieces, of the same<strong> color</strong> or <strong>number</strong>, in a straight line. Forming more than one match in a single move will multiply your reward, so plan each move carefully!</li><li>If the board gets too full, use the tile-bomb to remove some pieces. You can unlock it by forming matches of specific colors, as shown by the bars on the bottom right corner. </li><li>Simply drop it next to the pieces you want to clear of the board! Each level of the tile-bomb clears more pieces, but requires a different color to unlock.</li></ul>\n\r\nLiked this game?
