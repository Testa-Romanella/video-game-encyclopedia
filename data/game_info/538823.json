There is only <strong>ONE </strong>controll in this game. Use any button (I would recommend <strong>SPACE</strong>) to change the moon rotation way. So you can hit the asteroids. Earth has four lives.</p>\n\n<p>How does it match the theme? The theme is \"Delay the inevitable\", so you can delay the end of Earth and humanity by hitting asteroids.<br/></p>\n<p>It's all made by myself. So the graphics are not very good. I'm the programmer, so the code is quite well (But still written very fast and not accurate).\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's the first time, when I was recording sounds for a game. They are pretty terrible xD</p>\n<p>The video about the game's creation will be on this channel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a9090441a9f928987770dead0071a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Resadesker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
