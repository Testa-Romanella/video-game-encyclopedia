{"id": 476445, "slug": "oh-rats-2", "name": "Oh RATS!", "name_original": "Oh RATS!", "description": "<p>Oh Rats is a two-player turn-based casual strategy game where players must use\u00a0their rat population to expand their territory, and destroy the other colony of\u00a0rats. The artistic style of the game is a mix of rounded shapes and minimal line\u00a0art, and it lends itself well to the cute and casual nature of the game. Players are\u00a0charged with spending their rat population to build colonies or rat units that can\u00a0move around the hexagonal board. Having more rats means a player can spawn\u00a0more units to spawn more colonies and attack the opposing player's rat units\u00a0and colonies. Players must decide on how to spend their rats, as leaving yourself\u00a0with no rats leaves you without the ability to build more units or colonies. Players\u00a0can either be victorious through brute force or by careful thought out strategy.\u00a0The player that either takes the home colony or has the largest rat population at\u00a0the end of a set number of rounds is the winner!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b1830016f9bb2c644e1d436a983d4262.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donovan Garcia-Buckler", "csanford43", "Tiryth", "Dante Xystus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
