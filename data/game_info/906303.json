Plant various types of grain, sell that grain to make profit, and buy upgrades to boost your performance. Can you survive the Reaper's wrath?</p>\n<p>The game is played using WASD, and uses the mouse to interact with things and the environment. The Tab key opens the seeds menu, where seeds can be bought and planted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crows arrive occasionally too, which try to steal any crops or seeds you have, but can be fought off using the Scythe.</p>\n<p>Shops arrive at midday daily, and allow you to sell harvested crops and purchase upgrades.</p>\n<p><em>And <strong>something</strong> happens every three nights...</em></p>\n<p>Remember to have fun! There is no end-goal in the game other than trying to get the highest amount of money.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T08:49:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/219/2195313eaaa2e46706f917aa6dc9c5bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["enducube"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
