For my take on the brief, I thought of size and scale. Australia is a huge country, but we see so little of it. Girt By Sea tries to convey this by simulating driving from coast to coast (Brisbane to Perth being the initial idea). The idea is that you can start Girt running and leave it go for 40+ hours, checking in to see how far it's reached.</p><p>All road data is taken from Open Street Map, so it should be accurate, although I may render it a bit off (lanes and stuff).\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/56687ff613f3f20e8b822dd3cc908a78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kojack"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
