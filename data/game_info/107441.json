Lots of new effects!</p>\n\n<p>Knock 'em Out is a combination platform fighter (think Super Smash Bros) and beat-em-up. Instead of damaging enemies, hitting them knocks them back, and the more you hit them, the farther they'll fly! You're tasked with punching, kicking, juggling, and hurling a variety of nasty clowns off of a wealth of unique stages. The player character has over 20 unique moves to choose from, from basic punches and kicks to jets of fire, grenades, and even slowing down time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b328a381521a42e285dc74bc811a6f3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bynine"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
