You'll see what your customer want on the top left corner on the screen, make sure those items fall in the \"suitcase hole\" before the timer runs out, if unwanted items fall in this hole, you'll lose time. You can use your mouse to drag and move items. If there's too many items on screen, you can throw them in the \"fire hole\" where they'll be burnt (don't worry, they wont miss to anyone). <br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO INSTALL : <br/><br/>-Using the .zip (works only on Windows) : <br/>Unzip the files in a directory, and simply launch the .exe, it will trigger Windows Defender which is normal as the game isn't registered to Microsoft and is installed on very few computers. <br/><br/>-Using the .love (works on Windows, Mac and Linux):<br/>Install love2d on this website : https://love2d.org/ and launch the .love. <br/><br/>This game was made in ~2 days during the QUARANTINE JAM, the goal was to make a game following the theme \"Pack\".\u00a0 All of the assets were done during this time, except the font which is the \"FFF Forward font\" and the Match sprite which was reused from an old project. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc4eb758be45da76344279083ed93b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pordrack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
