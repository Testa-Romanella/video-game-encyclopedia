I had no idea that this would be a thing. I included downloads too for this reason.\r\nGoal\r\n<p>There isn't really one. Just explore and collect ingredients to craft potions in your cauldron. There are some things I really feel I should've made a tutorial for but I didn't have the time. So maybe this will appeal to people that like to figure things out for themselves.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>This is my submission for Medroidvania Month 15 and I had about a month to make it.\u00a0This game ended up being pretty much a demo because there isn't an end goal and what levels are there are short. I spent too much time implementing systems and making new environments and enemies when I should've\u00a0actually been making the game. But I think that my game jam project should be condensed anyway.</p>\n<p>But I had a story I wanted to tell dangit. Oh well.</p>\n<p>I may want to develop this world more at some point after the jam. Way into the future. Eventually.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The sounds came from Zapsplat.com\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/</p>\n<p>The music I used\u00a0in the house scene is Fireflies by Nul Tiel Records</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861f7ab23d2b37fe8c91dfbfa96fa282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
