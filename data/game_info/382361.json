You can increase your resource flow (i.e. decrease the time until you can build a new unit) by capturing and holding three resource points placed on the map. When stationary, units will automatically attack any enemies in range.</p>\n<p>But unlike most games it is not controlled with the mouse and you type commands instead. You can hold the Tab key on order to show all available commands, Esc clears the current input.</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 45 (\"Start with nothing\") by Christian Reuter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e637dc10c3a9ddfec5b9e9997c0b5458.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AoE-Maniac"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
