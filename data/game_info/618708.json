So when the two meet and discover that neither is interested in this marriage, they decide to team up to escape their matrimonial fate.</p>\n<p>Help the royal pair avoid the altar by navigating them through the castle and gardens of\u00a0Czeeseburgia, and avoiding the guards keeping a watchful eye on the grounds. Oh, and did we mention that (due to a completely unavoidable past incident regarding the Prince) they are literally chained together? Have fun~!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties in the final 12 hours, this project is not as completed as we had hoped, but we had an absolute blast and wanted to show what we managed to make!
