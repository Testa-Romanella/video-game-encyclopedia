When it closed down, most of the plushies and robots were either decommissioned to the {Fazbear's K-12 COMPANY} Storage Facility or reused for other Fazbear's K-12 Company establishments over the years, up until 2010 when the robots and plushies from Fredbear's Daycare -excluding Frank The Frankfox since he was reused for a different location and was dismantled shortly after- were left to rot in the storage facility.</p>\n<p>Your in the shoes of Shawn McAlton, a man who's in desperate need of a job in order to make some money to buy the finest things in life and it seems that you didn't find an interesting job until you saw a Nightguard job in the newspaper. You signed up for the job, got interviewed a day later and you were hired.</p>\n<p>And on the night of Sunday, June 20th,you walked into the {Fazbear's K-12 COMPANY} Storage Facility and you thought this job would be easy, but, it turns out that the job might've been a death trap when you saw that someone moved. So, it looks like that this job will not be easy after all.</p>\n<p><strong>QUESTION1: Why is this game being made?</strong></p>\n<p>There's 2 reasons:</p>\n<ol><li>Because I wanted to remake FNAF PLUSHIES 7 V1 which I made all the way back in 2017 and it was gonna be a clone of FNATAS6: The Lockdown in terms of office layout. But, I want to change that and let this remake of FNAF PLUSHIES 7 not be a clone of that game.</li><li>It's also because I wanted to let the series rest after this games' release and conclude the VOL.2 storyline. Because although The FNAF PLUSHIES ULTIMATE CUSTOM NIGHTS' storyline won't be canon to the FNAF PLUSHIES storyline, it is still part of VOL.2 nonetheless. And unfortunately, The FNAF PLUSHIES Ultimate Custom Night won't be released until later next year. But, you <strong>will\u00a0</strong>get some FNAF PLUSHIES Spinoff Games and other various projects while you wait, so don't you worry.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>QUESTION2: When did development start?</strong></p>\n<p>Development started all the way back in March 10th of last year.</p>\n<p>I originally started coding for the game on GM:S (Gamemaker: STUDIO) on March 23rd of last year. But when Clickteam started working again 2 days later, I switched to code the game on there instead. And it was on hiatus/on hold many times since then because of other projects. And now, I can finally code the game fully and if I am busy with a project or two, I will stop in and code the game and/or add some animations or images to the MFA.</p>\n<p>And that's all the questions, folks.  :)</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n\n<p>@22strezt  -Coder,Modeler,8-Bit Sprite Artist and New Mechanic Ideas<br/></p>\n<p>MODELERS:</p>\n<p><strong>HectorMKG- Nightmare Freddy MODEL (edited the textures to make him look like Scary Dave and I edited the model to make him more damaged)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Katamas- Funtime Springbonnie (edited the models skin color and eye texture)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Carlosparty19- Plushie MODELS (edited the textures and models so that they can look damaged and/or dirty)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a9d7416ad8b4de1b1de0fe53f002ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LEGO101 GAMES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
