This project is a collection of various gameplay mechanics and systems inspired by popular games. These mechanics have been recreated in the Unity game engine and include features such as object destruction, weapon customization, character customization, security cameras, scene splitting, enemy scanning, forcefields, and mechanic previewing.\r\n</p>\n<p>This project was created as part of an independent study during the Fall semester of 2022, and I plan to continue adding more mechanics to it in the future. The goal of this database is to serve as a repository of my work and a resource for game designers and developers to learn about and explore different gameplay mechanics.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0db225db3b03aaec0ffef20f0d5870ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Day4me23"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
