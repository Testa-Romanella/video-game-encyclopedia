The opening scene is the only thing to be regarded as canon.\u00a0The\u00a0<strong>entire ending will be re-done and re-written eventually with the exception of a few parts.</strong>\u00a0This project was made to cope with the loss of what once was my coping mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0It's 100% a personal, passion project and should be seen as such.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Plan your week! Spar with friends, hangout or just study away!\u00a0</li><li>Battle with your friends, each having new skills to offer!</li><li>Two romantic interests for each heroine... or have them fall for each other!</li><li>Play through 10 weeks of the school year</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>General Warning:</strong></p>\n<p>I had only intended to release the opening scene but got bored so this happened. Please regard anything beyond as incomplete, unedited, raw or even non-canon...\u00a0Especially the final scene.
