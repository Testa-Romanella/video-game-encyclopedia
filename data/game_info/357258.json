It started as an experiment to use ATTR collision detection for PLOTed coordinates, something which I\u00a0had struggled to get working reliably in my childhood programs. My aim at the time\u00a0had been to make a fun\u00a0game with as small a listing as I\u00a0could...</p>\n<p>Back to the present day\u00a0I was staggered to discover the incredible technical showcase that is\u00a0Digital Prawn's One Liner\u00a0Page.\u00a0A seed was planted. I\u00a0<em>had</em> to write a one liner game, just for the sheer challenge.</p>\n<p>Owing to the clumsiness of editing large program lines directly on a Spectrum, I used BasinC to adapt my existing program, optimising the listing into a single line occupying a\u00a0single screen of text during one very late night in July 2019.</p>\n<p>The game I\u00a0have made is in fact an approximate remake of a game (also called Line) that\u00a0I remember from\u00a0school, which ran on a black\u00a0Research Machines Link 480Z, a computer so obscure that I\u00a0could find no record of it at all until recently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T08:39:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/047/0476d180a7b8518daa7afb692afcb2a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["patters"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
