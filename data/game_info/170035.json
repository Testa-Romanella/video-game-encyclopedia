A rhythm racing game with a blend of medieval and techno aesthetics.</p>\n<p>Tapping on beats 1 and 3 makes your hoverhorse gain acceleration but lose turning controls (this spawns a blue cone around you). Tapping on beats 2 and 4 makes you turn faster but lose speed (yellow cone). If you pick up a flagon o' nitrous oxide, then you can tap to every eighth beat to activate boost to increase both speed and turning (white cone). If you miss a note (or don't press at all), you lose both speed and control.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W - Apply Thrust</p>\n<p>A and D - Turn left and right, respectively</p>\n<p>ENTER - Tap to keep the beat</p>\n<p>ESCAPE - Exit</p>\n\n<p>RESOURCES USED:</p>\n<p>Unity 3D</p>\n<p>FL Studio 12</p>\n<p>Blender</p>\n<p>The font style\u00a0Lucida Handwriting</p>\n\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<p>Since this game is rhythm-based, it is important to have a high frame rate to accurately check your input. If the game feels sluggish, try decreasing the screen size.</p>\n<p>The final code uses a small timing offset due to input lag from the testing computer. If you find the game doesn't register your beats, please let me know so I can fix it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/545aa5c5ad421fb6143ee5c4c16592e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NickHenley"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
