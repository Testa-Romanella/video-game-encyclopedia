Although their love is forbidden, the Queen vowed to send her lover offerings from the human plane.</p>\n<p>Every seven years, the Faerie Queen selects her favorite out of all the humans and sends their soul to hell. She expects that after enduring seven circles of sinful corruption, Paimon will be met with a soul so vile that it must have been sent by his long lost love. And thus, Paimon and the Faerie Queen are together in thought.</p>\n<p>To escape eternal punishments at the hands of the crowned king, one must be able to resist the temptations of sin as they progress through hell. Paimon would have no choice but to send the tormented soul back through to the surface realm, freeing you from the grips of hell. Of course, the Queen Faerie isn\u2019t gonna make things easy for you. Good luck!</p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>Get to the Slot Machine on every level to reach the surface.
