Honestly, there's no story! This game is pure gameplay! Feel free to make up whatever story as you deem fit XD<br/></p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Let me make something up.. *ahem* You are a person carrying a bomb, but, you only have 1 bomb so you can't throw it. You suddenly have the idea of just carrying the bomb on your back in order to make yourself heavier. By making yourself heavier, you realised you can jump on the enemy's head to send them out of existence! Your objective at first is to get out of the house as you have no idea how you got there. It turns out, there's lots of annoying whales and monsters in the house! What's worse, the house is built like a maze! Thankfully, the house is filled with lots of food, allowing you to go through on a full belly. When you got out of the house, you realised that the whale want to use it's fatness to block your way! Hence, you raced the whale, only to find yourself in yet another maze! What will you find at the end...\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 3 Actual Levels + 1 Bonus</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61\u00a0Uniquely designed levels and gameplay</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61\u00a0Lots of trolls</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Impossibly hard and annoying</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 2 Endings + 1 Bonus</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61\u00a0There's a walkthrough on Youtube if you need, but I recommend not using it! This game has been play tested multiple times and is 100% completable guaranteed!</p>\n\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Game Guide &amp; Walkthrough:<br/></p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Game Trailer:</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Extra Stuff:<br/></p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Truthfully, this game was only made to torture my friends, but I thought: Why not share it with the internet!</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 The game guide is recorded so badly!! I'm actually embarrassed at how bad I did it, but I don't want to replay the game ever again! It's there to guide anyone who is actually curious about how to actually get the good ending, because I don't think anyone will know how to win otherwise.. XD</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 I have never made a game trailer before and this is my first game ever made, please don't laugh at me (\u2267\ufe4f \u2266)</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 The name you see on itch.io and the downloaded versions might be called \"Impossible Whale\", which is the name I gave the game during development. So don't worry, it is the correct game!</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 The name is changed because I like this name more!</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Name explanation 1: The player keeps getting eaten by the whale, making you a tasty treat for the whale, hence, \"Final Whale-TASTY\" XD</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 Name explanation 2: It's a pun for \"Final Fantasy\", but changed to have a \"whale\" in it :p</p>\n\n\n<p>Final Note:</p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61 If you are reading this, thank you for trying out the game! :D<br/></p>\n<p>\u2606\u5f61\u00a0This is the absolute final version of this game! It is made for fun and there won't be updates on it after this. All the bugs and checkpoints requested are added as of now! I'm moving on to the next project! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T22:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677614be0bfef07187eda8e7d2104aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sakiho_Sakairi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
