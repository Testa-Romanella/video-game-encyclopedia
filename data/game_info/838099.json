Want a full unit of agressive, fast-moving heavy cannons? Sure. A stationary, lone sniper robot that always targets the furthest enemy away? Go right ahead. A three-storey high bot with multiple different turrets, each one of them aiming at a different type of enemy? We've got your back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 With this much variety, <em>Rosa of the Dead</em> allows you to experiment, strategize and play it your way with hundreds of possible viable builds - and even some game-breaking ones.<br/><br/></p>\r\nADAPT.\r\n\n<p>\u00a0 Customize Turret Targeting and Robot Behavior on the fly, improvising and adapting to the situation at hand. With multiple options to choose from at all times, making a sudden change of plans at a whim has never been so easy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Simply right-clicking any Robot will allow you to alter the way they work from any distance, even while you're still moving. If you don't like how you set it up, change it up!<br/><br/></p>\r\nSURVIVE.\r\n\n<p>\u00a0 Strategy takes you nowhere if you're not fast enough to make it happen: once the dead start coming, they don't stop coming - and if you're not prepared to quickly clear the screen once things get hectic, you'll soon be overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Every few seconds, a new wave of enemies invades your homeland. Increasingly stronger, increasingly faster, in increasingly higher numbers. Strategy is imperative, but speed is key. Your reflexes will be tested at all times: quickly choose the parts and build the robots, run and swerve to avoid direct contact with the creatures, and make lightning-fast decisions at every second.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Do you have what it takes to survive the full 10 minutes until dusk, or shall the night sky find you six feet under?</p>\n\n<em>\"Ok let's go for something simple this time\"<br/>- everyone, before doing the exact opposite<br/></em>\n<em>\"Oh wow, it actually looks like a real game!\"</em><br/><em>- us</em>\n<em>\"I'm really proud of the explosion animation\"<br/>- guy who spent an unreasonable amount of time doing the explosion animation</em>\n\n\n\n\r\nScreen Tears Team\r\n\r\nJustTheDani\r\nArt / Music / Sound Effects / Game Design\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/justthedani\r\n<br/>\r\nitch.io:\u00a0justthedanii.itch.io\r\n<br/>\r\nSpotify:\u00a0sptfy.com/KL5N</p>\n\r\nLuca Boechat Marc\u00edlio\r\nArt / Visual Effects / Game Design / Level Design\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/lucaboechat\r\n<br/>\r\nitch.io:\u00a0boecharts.itch.io\r\n<br/>\r\nTwitter:\u00a0twitter.com/LucaBoechat</p>\n\r\nMason Smart\r\nCode / Game Design\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/everyth1ngninja\r\n<br/>\r\nitch.io:\u00a0everyth1ngninja.itch.io\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full soundtrack coming to Spotify soon!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f873cf0875c5aa106091184423e216e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boecharts", "just the dani", "Everyth1ngNinja"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
