This is a small prototype of the mechanics of changing realities - from an everyday room to a medieval one.</p>\n<p>This mechanic was inspired by Fran Bow and I wanted to try something that was not scary.</p>\n<p>In mechanics, there are only two working buttons located at the bottom left corner.</p>\n<p>To switch reality, simply click on the big pebble and it will switch from red to yellow or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in each reality, you can turn on and off the light. To do this, click on the small button.</p>\n\n<p>I almost completely rendered the rooms and the interface myself, and it was such a cool experience! You can watch a video about it by turning on the subtitles.</p>\n<p>You can download the mechanics file for Construct 2 below by clicking on the button. This is a .capx file so make sure you have Construct 2 and it's version r279 or higher before applying.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, you can download a .png file (transparent background) with furniture from this project or full .zip file.</p>\n\n<p>I can be contacted here:<br/></p>\n<p>https://t.me/GameSunlight<br/>https://vk.com/kheylady</p>\n<p>_______________<br/></p>\n\n<p>Other projects (click on image)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T09:49:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/682/68285232a287fb4c2d3615dc0bb031c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
