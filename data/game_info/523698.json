April 2021.)</p>\n<p>Also, feel free to reach out for a roadmap of planned development, and we'll try to keep this page updated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7cc28a571430f184291c188028f60c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sal48"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
