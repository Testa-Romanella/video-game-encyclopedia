When an enemy piece is in range, you can choose to attack that enemy piece.</p>\r\nAttacking:\r\n<p>Each different type of piece (Dog, Rabbit, Alien or Spaceship) has two specialty moves, and a dodge. When a player attacks, both players choose a move (It is\u00a0<strong>highly</strong> reccomended that players look away when other players are choosing their move. This gives the game a \"rock, paper, scissors\" style strategy). Specialty moves will interact, giving one of three outcomes:</p>\n<p>A full win: The loser's piece is removed, and the winner's piece advances.</p>\n<p>A half win: The loser's piece is removed, but the winner's piece remains still.</p>\n<p>A draw: Neither piece is removed, or moved.</p>\n<p>If one player dodges, the other will advance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:29:20", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Detective Software Devs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
