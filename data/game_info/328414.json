It's the same nightmare for everyone: they find themselves inside of a strange structure, with a sword in front of them. They are haunted in this dream by enemies, and can become more powerful by acquiring items. The townspeople suspect there is something important at the peak of the labyrinth, but no one's been able to reach there alive.</p>\n<p>You're tasked to face this Labyrinth every time you go to sleep.</p>\r\nGame\r\n<p><em>Labyrinth\u00a0</em>features a procedural generated dungeon filled with enemies and treasures.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game encourages collecting a lot of\u00a0loot by allowing item abilities to stack on top of each other with no limit whatsoever. Items can range anywhere from a simple boost to your attack stat, all the way to making enemies explode upon death, and even giving the player the ability to consume enemies to recover health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are several weapons that can generate for the player to use, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Spears can attack the quickest, but are weaker than others. Sledgehammers can deal incredible damage, but are the slowest to attack.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard/Mouse:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD/Space- Move/Jump; E- Interact/Pick up; Mouse/LMB- look/attack</p>\n<p>Tab: Stats menu; I: Inventory menu; P: Pause Menu</p>\n<p><strong>Controller:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Joysticks: Move/Look; A: Interact/Pick up; Y: Jump; RT: Attack</p>\n<p>Back: Stats menu; B: Inventory; Start: Pause Menu</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>I still have a lot planned for this game, and I am wholeheartedly really excited for the future of this game.
