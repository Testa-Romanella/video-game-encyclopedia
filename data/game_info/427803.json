For every 10 slaps, the speed will increase, revealing something new, shiny and distracting on your screen.<br/>Be warned, these skele-fiends are NOT to be taken lightly, sometimes they may appear in waves so watch your surrounding vision very carefully.<br/>See how many you can get through before the horde inevitably overwhelms you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/164/1646f25d7b15472764b84ccc53d4ac31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oddfellows Software"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Oddfellows Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
