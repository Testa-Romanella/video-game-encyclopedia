(22) Almost everything visual from models to UI is made by me and I see myself as the creative heart of our duo. Throughout my life I've always had an intense passion for gaming and the second I loaded up Final Fantasy XII for the first time in my PS2 all those years ago I knew that video games are what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAfter growing over the years and teaching myself to model, I met the brilliant coder of our team, Mixtape a.k.a. Marquis Madden (22) in my junior year science class. We hit it off immediately and he became the backbone of this duo as well as one of my closest friends. He grew up playing Halo on his Xbox and always wanted to create compelling and immersive experiences and by teaching himself to code, we became 2 halves of a whole!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe call that whole, Craptop Studios. Nice to meet you!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nPatch Notes\r\n<p>\r\n\t- 5/17/2017 - Arena of the Gods v1.0 is now available!</p>\n<p>- 5/24/2017 - Arena of the Gods Update v1.1 has been released!</p>\n<p><strong>- </strong>5/31/2017 - Arena of the Gods Update v1.2 has been released!</p>\n<p>- 8/12/2017 -\u00a0Arena of the Gods Update v1.3 has been released!<br/></p>\n<p>- 3/22/2018 - Arena of the Gods Update v1.4 has been released!</p>\n<p>- 4/5/2018 -\u00a0Arena of the Gods Update v1.5a has been released!</p>\r\n- 8/21/2018 - Arena of the Gods Update v1.6: New Challengers Appear!\r\n<p>Arena of the Gods v1.6 is now live! Here's a rundown of the changes:<br/><br/><strong>- Vital information\u00a0</strong><br/>To promote enhanced readability, the player's healthbar now has a background behind it instead of showing the arena through it's empty space. Enemies now have health bars that appear when they take damage and disappear after a few seconds for reduced clutter.<br/><br/><strong>- Eternal life, endless torture\u00a0</strong><br/>Added a new, tanky demon giant called the Ghast. The Ghast lumbers around slowly, but relentlessly, crushing any opposition under it's slow but mighty fists. The Ghast's slam deals 35% of your current health as damage. The slam's shockwave deals a small amount of flat damage.<br/><br/><strong>- Supersanic\u00a0</strong><br/>Added a new, speedy flying demon called the saberwing. The Saberwing patrols the arena at high speeds, slicing any would be arena champions to bits with their blade-like wings and fierce wind gusts. The Saberwings fly ahead of the player, preventing him from fleeing their assault by cutting off his escape routes with well timed spin attacks.<br/><br/><strong>- Not the bots you're looking for\u00a0</strong><br/>Enemies have completely revamped AI, making them react much more intelligently and realistically. Enemies now have object permanence causing them to leave combat after losing track of the player for too long.<br/><br/><strong>- Guiding Light\u00a0</strong><br/>Improved overall lighting quality. Time of day changes simulate smoother than before. Enemy projectiles give off less light.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>- Dusk\u00a0</strong><br/>Night time is darker than before, making visivility more limited.<br/><br/><strong>- 1000 yard stare\u00a0</strong><br/>The Caster, Launcher, and Seeker mages' eyes shine much brighter to more accurately reflect their eerie, demonic existence.<br/><br/><strong>- Making me dizzy\u00a0</strong><br/>Enemies no longer perfectly track the player in combat allowing the player to break their line of sight through motion.<br/><br/><strong>- Water is not wet\u00a0</strong><br/>The waterfalls in the arena were in the need of some dire TLC, so they're sporting a new look that actually reacts to the time of day and various other lighting changes. Water material improved to look a lot less flattened.<br/><br/><strong>- Extroverted\u00a0</strong><br/>Feeling talkative?\u00a0Arena of the Gods now has a Discord channel\u00a0\u00a0where you can keep up with news, get free promotional content in the future, report bugs, or even just have a chill chat and post a few memes.<br/><br/>We have a HUGE amount of changes to the game that we plan to ship very soon, so be ready for a lot of anticipated features in our next few updates!\u00a0<br/><br/>That's all for now!
