There is a lot to tackle and I am not afraid to give it my all.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This is Coagulation. A PSX Style Metroidvania - It's time to go kill Dracula! (Again)</strong></p>\n<p>Made in UE4.26</p>\n<p>The game is set in the 90's so there will be some throwbacks, and will try and be as close to Castlevania as possible, while also not being too complex, like Aria of Sorrow.</p>\n<p>The main catch is that as it is 2.5D it will not strictly follow a plane and/or axis, there will be ways to traverse the environments in a more complex way\u00a0</p>\n<p>The art style i am trying to go for is emulating the PS1 as close as possible (no float point rendering, Textrue Affining, custom lighting using UVs, there is no real lighting built at all, Low res screen and textures as well as low fps as the busy feel would probably strain a PS1, well, nuke it),\u00a0while also using more modern features.\u00a0 I am using Ps1 games like Tomb Raider, Nightmare Creatures, Soul Reaver, Klonoa and Deathtrap Dungeon as inspiration.</p>\n<p>There will be NPC's to interact with, including shops, Item requests, maybe some light questing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The environment will be completely open world,\u00a0 little to no transitions, very varying\u00a0 feels between the areas, it should feel vast and daunting at first, there will be many shortcuts interlinking various areas</p>\n<p>best played with a gamepad\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls are (in keyboard/Xbox terms):\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/D-pad or Left Analog - Move\r\n</p>\n<p>Space/A - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>X/RB - Attack\r\n</p>\n<p>Tab/Y - Menu\r\n</p>\n<p>Esc/Start - Pause Menu\r\n</p>\n<p>In Menu:\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/D-Pad - Move Selection\r\n</p>\n<p>Space Bar/A - Use/Equip and Unequip\r\n</p>\n<p>Z/LB - Previous Menu Selection\r\n</p>\n<p>X/RB - Next Menu Selection\r\n</p>\n<p>C/X - (equipment Only) Toggle Equipment and Equipped\r\n</p>\n<p>P.S I need a sound and music person, hit me up if and we can talk about things</p>\n<p>keep an eye on this space!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/accd7be49672b0a0442bcf9a3b7dc87d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kordan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
