The cave exploration drones have gone haywire, and we need your help! They're only responding to switching positions, but they are able to send signals that effect each other. See if you can figure out how to get to the bottom!</p><p>This is more of a puzzle/strategy game than a traditional match-3. The numbers and positioning are important so plan your moves accordingly. Click on any two drones to have them swap places. Matching 3 drones of the same height (number) causes them to signal the adjacent drones to go up or down depth. Red/positive adds and blue/negative subtracts their value from the surrounding drones. Drones that go above ground (negative depth) go unresponsive and can no longer be interacted with. Above 10, multiples of 7 (14,21,28) clear rows, and multiples of 9 (18,27) clear columns. The row and column clears will destroy unresponsive drones to allow for new drones to be deployed. Reach 25 feet (or lower) with a drone to win! Be careful not to land on 21, 27, or 28 or they will cause an explosion (multiples of 7 or 9). Thanks for checking it out, I hope you enjoy and please rate when you get a chance!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/617e13ce0a3ca5b665ada18f3081f2fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doublesquare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
