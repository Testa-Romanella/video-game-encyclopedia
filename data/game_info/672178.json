It is an infinite enemy wave team game where all players work together to survive for as long as possible. The core concept is each person serves one function in the team. The knight can push and block enemies from their teammates, the barbarian deals melee damage and the ranger shoots arrows from afar. The fourth role, the priest, is the most important. They are the only player on the team with health, but their health is the entire team's health. If they take enough damage everyone dies. Good luck and have fun!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is marked\u00a0<strong><em>beta</em></strong> but it should be marked\u00a0<strong><em>experimental</em></strong>. As of right now once you begin play team roles are determined by player index. So player 1 will always be the priest and so on. Once the game is started the AI are not functioning correctly and there is no way to end the game. If you decide to download and launch this game you will have to use the task manager to terminate it, this will be patched ASAP.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98e/98e748602d8babd0b93069fef2076134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Pope"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
