Racing", "description": "Drive into excitement and fun with the Monster Trucks Motorbike Game for Kids app!  If you dig monster truck rally\u2019s and love the stunts the trucks and motorcycles do then you\u2019ll love exploring and enjoy this cool app.  With over 30 activities and games you will get to really experience what it feels like to be in a Monster truck jam!  This super fun app was designed by teachers with over 15 years childcare experience, using their philosophy of learning through play. <br/><br/>Monster Truck and Motorcycle Driving Games<br/>Come to the Rally and have a blast driving in different creative exciting worlds!  And the best part is you can drive a monster truck or motorcycle in each world, and they do different cool things.  For example the Monster truck in space can jump over rocks, and the Firetruck Motorcycle can shoot water and put out fires!  It\u2019s engaging fun and with every game having unique features it\u2019s a whole new exciting experience for each one. <br/><br/>Driving Dress-up<br/>Another delight-filled part of the driving game is that before they get to the world they will be racing in they have to get dressed in the right gear by tapping them.  When you choose your character to drive you first have to tap, tap, tap and reveal the outfit and/or gear they will need for the game.  For example the Police Monster truck will be driving at night so along with his siren, hat, and badge he will need a flashlight to light the way on the track!  Dressing up before they drive is not only super fun but enriching for imaginations as well.<br/><br/>Tap Animations<br/>Little fingers love to tap, tap, tap, and these cool Monster truck and Motorcycle tap animations will delight and engage all Monster truck rally fans! With the Tap Animations your little ones will get to make the trucks and motorcycles do the stunts as fast or as slow as they want while hearing a funky tune play.  Tapping the screen will take them to the next frame so they are similar to the old comic flip books because the faster you tap the faster the truck or motorcycle does the stunt!  It\u2019s engrossing for little ones to see and control the animation and it makes them feel like they are doing the cool stunts themselves! It\u2019s super monster truck rally fun. <br/><br/>Monster truck and Motorcycle Puzzle Games<br/>Adding even more fun to the Monster Trucks Motorbike Game for Kids app is the puzzle games!  Using the same themes as the driving worlds the puzzles delve them further into those worlds by adding different elements that belong to that theme and letting them play with them.  With three games for each theme they will get to see loads of dinosaurs, spaceships, police puppies, and of course candy!  It's a creative way to have fun with each world and will help their creativity abound.<br/><br/>It\u2019s time to go to the Monster truck rally and have a blast driving, making animations, and playing with puzzles.  Let your little ones drive into fun and let their imaginations and creativity grow with the Monster Trucks Motorbike Game for Kids app!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T05:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daae705cf790d4d88cc8847e24adbb14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nancy Mossman"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nancy Mossman"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
