As a result, Alyx is currently in further education studying subjects that he has no interest in and dating a girl who he doesn't have feelings for.\u00a0 He has known for a while that his romantic urges tend to veer towards other males but is afraid of actually mentioning it to his mother for fear of upsetting her. In fact, Alyx refuses to even accept himself, preferring instead to just let life pass him by. Despite being fairly miserable, Alyx is empathetic to the point that he would prefer to suffer in silence than face the possibility of hurting others. His only solace lies in a chat group he came across online, where he's able to be a truer version of himself around the other members of the group, Alvy, Sio, Elil, and Kagan.</p>\n<p>One day, Alyx is involved in an accident that puts him in a coma. As he dreams away in hospital, a mysterious figure called Merrik visits him, claiming to be his spirit guide. Merrik warns Alyx that if he continues to refuse to accept himself then he will never wake up. All hope is not lost, as Merrik offers Alyx another opportunity to live, with the condition that he makes an effort to be true to himself. There is one condition, however, Alyx must prove to Merrik that he has the ability to change within just 3 days, or face death after all.</p>\n<p>With the help of his online friends, can Alyx learn to love himself for who he really is on the inside? The outcome is entirely up to you! Make choices and help Alyx on his journey of self-discovery, deepen friendship with his online companions, and possibly even find true love :3</p>\n<p><strong>(Click the images on the side to view character profiles :3)</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose this would fall under the category of slice of life, with a bit of fantasy mixed in. I've never even played a yaoi game before as I prefer otome's instead, so I have no idea if I'm even doing this right, or how it compares to all the yaoi content out there &gt;.&lt; But at the end of the day, I\u00a0 just figured it's a story about friendship, love, and learning to accept yourself... and I wanted to tell it, so yeah xD\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since I'm still working hard on my main project, Solipsism Reigns, development for this is going to be slow, sorry T_T but SR takes priority, haha. I will, however, try my very best to get at least one whole route completed in time for submission by the end of the jam! :3 If everything goes according to plan you should be able to play the prologue, common route and Alvy's route. If there's somehow enough time for me to complete a second route then I'll hold a poll or something to see which one people would prefer to play ^_^ Rest assured though, this project will be completed at some point after Solipsism Reigns is released.</p>\n<p>Because of the time limitations on this project, I decided it would be best to edit some of Tokudaya's sprites to make the characters, so if they seem familiar, that's why! I did my best to edit them in a way that makes them look a little more unique at least :3</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope that someone out there somewhere will get some form of enjoyment out of this project at some point ^_^/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b796bd83cb3cd97abe050feda58add6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IkariKali"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
