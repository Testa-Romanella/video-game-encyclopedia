{"id": 16144, "slug": "dungeon-siege", "name": "Dungeon Siege", "name_original": "Dungeon Siege", "description": "<p>Dungeon Siege is an action RPG developed by Gas Powered Games. It is the first title in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In the fictional Kingdom of Ehb, a farmer sets out to another village to warn its residents about the invasion of the Krug. The story unravels rapidly, and the players have to save the whole kingdom.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Dungeon Siege is played from a top-down third-person perspective. At the beginning of the game, the players create a character to play as. On his way, the main character finds new comrades that can join his party. Seven other characters can join the player&#39;s party and are controlled by the artificial intelligence. The players can switch between the characters in this party at any gameplay moment. </p>\n<p>The game features a seamless open world. The players encounter numerous monsters on their path, and their party defends themselves. There is no character class system in the game. Instead, if the player uses a certain item for a long time, their handling skill of it will increase. Such a system was later implemented in The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim. After leveling up, the players gain a base stat increase. </p>\n<p>The game features an inventory system, represented as a grid, where the items take space and can be rotated and placed differently in the inventory to save some space. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game features a cooperative experience for eight players. It is possible to play through the game&#39;s main storyline or engage in a horde mode on a specific multiplayer map.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2002-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d790c12a425f81fa079b973e5f8814d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.95, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1684, "beaten": 168, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 82, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 209, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 212, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gas Powered Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Destineer"], "esrb_rating": null}
