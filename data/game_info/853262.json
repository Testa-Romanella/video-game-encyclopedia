{"id": 853262, "slug": "faerie-market", "name": "Faerie Market", "name_original": "Faerie Market", "description": "<p>Trouble is brewing in the world of Faerie. The ruling High Fae have been restless, and the consequences of their unease could mean the end of the comfortable life you've made for yourself outside the strict control of the Courts. \r\n</p>\n<p>The sudden appearance of an old acquaintance, an agent of the very system the Market rebelled from, is worrying enough on its own. But when you find a strange outsider hidden away in your storage room who claims to be a cursed human pleading for your help, you know you've gotten yourself into something far bigger than it appears. Your going to have to use every trick you\u2019ve got up your sleeves to protect your fellow vendors, a few of whom are quickly proving themselves to be more trustworthy than their fae nature would suggest.\r\n</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>Customize your MC, from their wings to what court they used to serve in! \r\n</li><li>Romance one of 5 fully nonbinary, minimally human romance options! \r\n</li><li>Customize what your shop specializes in- from potions of luck to literal silver tongues. Anything is for sale at the Market if you're willing to pay\r\n</li><li>Help destabilize the oppressive monarchs that rule Faerie with an iron fist\r\n</li><li>Form a found family with a group of outsiders\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Cast</p>\n<p><strong>The Snake | </strong>Silvesse,\u00a0They/them<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Your supplier of magical herbs that grow in the dense magical forests that isolate The Market from the rest of Faerie. Silvesse isn\u2019t one for idle chatter, keeping their interactions short and blunt before slithering off to their preferred solitude. An outsider among outsiders, Silvesse cares more about The Market than they let on. They seem to like you, at least more than they like the other vendors.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Bull |</strong> Willow, He/them<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Your closest friend in The Market, Willow, has always felt like a bit of an outsider. Far too shy for the lavish parties of Summer, far too trusting for the cutthroat business dealing of The Market. A minotaur's magic is usually tied to the earth; it allows them to move heavy stone walls in their labyrinths. Willow\u2019s traditional magic skills are a bit rusty, but the protective charms he makes and sells in your shop are beyond compare. they would follow you to the ends of the earth, if only you\u2019d ask.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Outsider | </strong>Beck, She/them<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>How are you meant to react when a stranger barges into your store in the middle of the night, begging for your help curing a curse and claiming that despite all evidence to the contrary, they are quite human? Well, any good businessman would tell you to strike a deal, of course. And you did. And now you\u2019re stuck with her, whether you like it or not. You can\u2019t decide if her complete disregard for danger is endearing or exhausting.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Dragon | </strong>Lindwrym, xe/xir<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Lindwyrm has, perhaps, been living in The Market since its very creation. The self-described \u2018Guardian of The Market\u2019 has a bite just as bad as xir bark. It would seem that Lindwrym\u2019s hoard has become the Market itself, as xe has little in the ways of usual dragon treasure. In fact, on the off chance xe actually by something from a vendor xe works almost exclusively in favors. Xe always follows through with a promise, however, which is worth your weight in gold in Faerie.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Hound | </strong>Solstice, they/them<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>You knew them, once. Before you gave up a life running messages for the High Fae that rule the four courts. They seem even more driven than when you last worked together, desperate to keep up with the harsh demands of King Winter. Solstice seems to be making strives in their court at least, if the fact that they seem to be on some sort of reconnaissance mission is anything to go by. But there\u2019s something hiding under the emotionless mask they wear, will you be the one to break through to them?\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T10:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad398f034df4ed8a3b02247474d84dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bitterpossum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
