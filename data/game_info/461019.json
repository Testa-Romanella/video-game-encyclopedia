The phylosophy of the game remains the same but new functions have been introduced such as the possibility of creating custom Decals that can be exported and shared. In this version it is also possible to configure many aesthetic and physical aspects of the vehicles, which also in this case can be exported and shared. In the level there is no lack of ramps and other physical objects to move and compose as you wish, which will remain in the last desired position. You can play with keyboard, mouse or gamepad or set your own custom controls.
