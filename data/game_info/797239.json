Only by reaping enough souls can you move on to the next plane of existence.</p>\n<p>Controls : wasd for motion, \"r\" or left mouse button\u00a0for \"reap\" attack. Mouse scroll wheel changes minimap zoom level. You can hit \"n\" to advance to the next day (sometimes Ghosts might be stuck or you might fall in a hole that you can't get out of and cannot complete the level)</p>\n<p>One day after the submission deadline, I\u00a0fixed two bugs :\u00a0the player controller freaking out when trying to walk backwards, and the transparency problems on the tree textures in the WebGL build. I also tweaked camera settings to make it less jittery (CineMachine switched from \"Third Person\" to \"Transposer\" -- much better for this game)</p>\n<p>Source code available at :\u00a0https://github.com/jgrogers/DeathIsOnlyTheBeginning</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c3ace48d2aea1ac6df756c26943ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["djohnndjinn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
