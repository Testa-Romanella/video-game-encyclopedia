Try and get it all.\r\n</p>\r\nJump too late\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you jump a little too late, because your brain was not quiet fast enough (not planning ahead enough). \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tYou will not fall. You will still jump. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis eliminates one of the biggest sources of frustration with Jump-and-Run games.\r\n</p>\r\nAnti-Rogue-Like\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce you are alive, you will never die. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThere is no fall damage. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tYou will find no enemies. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tEverything is designed to minimize frustration.\r\n</p>\r\nExplore a million levels\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tThe caves you explore are randomly generated. You can play a different cave every time. Or you can play the same cave over and over again. Every cave has a unique name (seed). If you find a cool one you can share it with your friends (just tell them the name).\r\n</p>\r\nSimple Graphics\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tMost games have detailed, highly animated and exciting graphics. A problem, if you want your brain to relax. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\tThis game uses simple shapes and few colors.\r\n</p>\r\nImprove your score\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tOnce you have finished relaxing. The game has a challenging side as well. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\tYou can speed-run caves, trying to get to the top fast. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\tOr you can try to collect as much gold as possible.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7edd2dd0dd57ed0b6d1041bd618878e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julius Eckert"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
