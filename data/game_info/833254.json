They are transporting a prisoner he recently captured to his trial. As his wife begins to go into labor on the train, the detective\u2019s life is changed forever by a mystery he will need to solve. The question is\u2026 will he ever make it off this train?</p>\n\n<p>This is a story/mystery game with no combat elements. It is character driven and lasts from 25 minutes to an hour. If you ever find yourself lost, try looking for the Ticketmaster, as he usually has something helpful to say.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<p>Using your arrow keys to control your character, and Z or your space bar to interact with surroundings is the advised way to play the game. You can also use your mouse to move and interact by clicking on your surroundings, though this will cause you to sprint.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also play with a controller or use keyboard config in the options to set new controls.\r\n</p>\r\nTo play:\r\n\r\n<p>Download the available folder and unzip the files. Inside, click on the game.exe file to start the game.</p>\n\n<p>We are a team of four video game lovers, who\u2019ve now joined together to create Honk Honk! Studios. This was our first ever attempt at making a game, and although it was stressful and time consuming, it was an extremely fun learning experience. This game was made specifically for the IGMC: Rebirth Game Jam and the theme we chose was rebirth. We really hope you enjoy what we made and would love to hear what you think about it below!</p>\r\n\r\nArts and Visual Director:\r\n\r\n<p>Holly Boone\r\n</p>\r\nGame Development Director:\r\n\r\n<p>Jeffrey Stogsdill\r\n</p>\r\nLead Story Director and General Assistant:\r\n\r\n<p>Blake Cutrer\r\n</p>\r\nSprite Artist and Story Developer:\r\n\r\n<p>Nick Chastain</p>\r\nPlugin/Engine Credits:\r\n\r\n<p>Galvs Scripts - https://galvs-scripts.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>SRDude - http://sumrndm.site/\r\n</p>\n<p>Yanfly Engine\r\n</p>\n<p>Moghunter\r\n</p>\n<p>Degica\r\n</p>\n<p>RPG Maker MV\r\n</p>\n\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>Crystalline Pathway - William Benckert\r\n</p>\n<p>Evil Eternal Carousel - Ludvig Moulin\r\n</p>\n<p>Furna - By Lotus\r\n</p>\n<p>Ghost Train - Martin Klem\r\n</p>\n<p>Health - Heath Cantu\r\n</p>\n<p>I Can Feel You're Close Now - Luella Gren\r\n</p>\n<p>Inbound - Brendon Moeller\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement of the Unknown - William Claeson\r\n</p>\n<p>One Seven Four Two - Isobel O'Connor\r\n</p>\n<p>Tablespoons - Martin Landstrom\r\n</p>\n<p>The Comedian - Rich in Rags\r\n</p>\n<p>Trailblazer - Daniel Fridell\r\n</p>\n<p>Trans Siberian Express - Luella Gren\r\n</p>\n<p>Valse Pour Dauphine - Martin Landstrom\u00a0</p>\n<p>Courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e3036ddf2bbebbcf7fca7a7e4fd9d681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Honk Honk Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
