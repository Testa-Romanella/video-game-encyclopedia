But beware, you need to make it back to your portal before the sun catches you! It's mechanically a simple platformer, but it has some speedrun-y elements which you'll discover. And I think it fits the themes pretty well!</p>\n<p><strong>Collectables</strong> - Gotta collect food</p>\n<p><strong>There and back</strong> - You need to make it back to your portal with a full belly before the sun comes up!</p>\n<p>PC controls only - Arrow keys for control, mouse on the title screen.\u00a0 \u00a0There is no save function, the game is very short and designed to be played in one sitting</p>\n<p>The game isn't as finished as I'd like it to be, given more time I would add more of a story, more levels, and more of a sense of progression. Also I'm unsure how balanced it is because I've had very few play testers. But I'm pretty happy with it and I confident it's in a playable state.</p>\n<p>I've had a blast making it, so I hope you get at least a few minutes of enjoyment out of it. &lt;3 Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Vimlark for inspiring me to give it a try. Construct 3 is a great program and I've caught the bug.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ac/6ac2f7bb171b0209f0b4087f07906c16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Talfuin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
