Play as a modern-day druid living in suburbia, holding down a dead-end job to pay for your true vocation: conducting the annual ritual that keeps the world from ending.<br/><br/>To delay the end of the world, you must sacrifice a number of specific - but vaguely-described - human beings every year. Use a video editing-inspired interface to discover the story of your victims' lives, one schedule block at a time. Pry into the most intimate details of your targets' schedules, and when the time is right: <strong>abduct</strong> them before the authorities can find your lair. Time is short and your list of names is long. Choose your options wisely... and pray that the dark god you serve is even real.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Use an innovative \"timeline\" interface for a new kind of analog horror game.<br/></li><li>Get to know the unsuspecting targets of your town, intimately.<br/></li><li>Replayable blend of authored and generated stories.<br/></li><li>Fully voiced story mode featuring Xalavier Nelson Jr. and Jarret Griffis.<br/></li><li>Original atmospheric soundscape from David Mason, the composer of DREDGE.<br/></li><li>An additional endless mode coming within a month after launch.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T06:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce32956f5f34c7ffde7ef575785f9b0f.jpg", "website": "https://www.strangescaffold.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strange Scaffold"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Strange Scaffold", "Frosty Pop"], "esrb_rating": null}
