You have one objective, get out of this town. You start at a door with 3 locks. Find the 3 keys randomly located around the map all while being hunted by something. Remember keep it in the light or it will catch you.. Keep it in the light too long.. you may anger it.</p>\n<p>Thank you everyone for checking out the store page of my first game. It has always been a dream of mine to make games and just a couple months ago I decided to take that first leap. This was my first game ever and I am very excited to share my progress in this journey with you all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about the game or myself head over to\u00a0<br/>https://www.kingobgames.ca/<br/><br/><br/>Feel free to leave a comment on any issues or ideas for future content.
