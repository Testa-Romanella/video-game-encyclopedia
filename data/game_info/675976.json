You will have control of the left and right movement of your spaceship, while its speed will be in constant acceleration. Each collision will slow you down, but luckily you can also use speed boosts to quickly gain a lot of speed ! Slow down too much and you'll get caught ! <br/><br/> <em><strong>WARNING : This game contains fast flashing images and lights.
