The ball bounces on platforms if it collides from the top, but doesn't if it collides from the bottom. Coins are scattered throughout the game, interact with them to increase your final score by 10 (per coin collected). Meteors may spawn randomly throughout the game, increasing in frequency as it goes on. These destroy the ball on contact. AVOID THEM!! Oh, and the walls kill you, did I mention that?</p>\n<p>Inspired by Lynez by TheFluffyPotato</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T12:26:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c35/c35a975c35be3ae1050c68d3c8d04fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Burnt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
