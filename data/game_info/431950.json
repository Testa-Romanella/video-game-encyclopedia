Now, all these years later and with over a decade of experience working in software, I'm getting serious about games again. This is my first solo project for general release, and it seemed like making an old dream a reality would be the perfect way to start.<br/><br/>Localization:<br/>I\u00a0built this game to be localized but only really speak English. So! If you'd like to see Zombie Squirt in your native language and want to help me translate it, please reach out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T11:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e85c81a905d6d791927e77608a4eaa33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kooshipuff"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
