{"id": 777398, "slug": "smith-hallowedtree", "name": "Smith (HallowedTree)", "name_original": "Smith (HallowedTree)", "description": "The Game\r\n<p>This demo game is currently a prototype of a unique\u00a0crafting system intended for a future RPG. The unique element is that the weapons you can craft are not all just carbon copies of each other but are each truly unique, every piece is hand-forged by you, the Smith. With this system, you can not only craft items that are unique visually but they are also functionally unique, each design choice, every blow of the hammer will affect how the weapon performs in combat!</p>\n<p>To craft a weapon the Smith first needs to select the iron. Then this is heated\u00a0in the forge, operating the bellows to speed things up.\u00a0 Next, the iron is taken to the anvil, where the smith undergoes the work of forging the piece into whatever their mind conceives.\u00a0 - So far this is all that the demo includes, just about everything is a WIP.\u00a0</p>\r\nWarning\r\n<p>Please note this is not intended as a functioning game or even a full minigame, it really is more of a single feature from a future planned RPG extracted and prototyped. In the full game, this is intended to be one of many integrated game systems which all interact with each other. So if you want to leave any feedback, which would be very welcome, then please leave it on the grounds of what about this demo as a crafting system could be improved, added to, or modified for a better player experience.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T13:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a0824a85e545b7c7f35b54b44c9523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HallowedTree"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
