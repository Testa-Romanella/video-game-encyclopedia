{"id": 705142, "slug": "imposing-force", "name": "Imposing Force", "name_original": "Imposing Force", "description": "<p>You are Pietra, a 23 year old that lives in Utrial, one of the most oppressive countries on earth. Pietra is in precinct 13, one of the more \"loose\" precincts, where laws are less impressed than in most others. Along your journey you will meet many factions and interesting people. Your choices will matter here, and each one you make may make an impact to Utrial, but maybe they won't either. Maybe you will become another cog in the machine of Utrial's political system, or maybe you will become a rebel, fighting for what you think is right. Or maybe you will just be another corpse for the rats to eat.</p>\n\n<p>The game is in beta, and will be for quite awhile, considering making this game is not my only priority at the moment. But I will make steady progress as time goes on, hopefully releasing an increasing amount of demos as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am also working on music for battles and ambience, since the ones that come with RPG Maker MV aren't all that great and don't fit the feel I'm going for. Consider that I have no prior music skills, so the music will be bad, or take forever to come out, or both.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also please leave feedback! The only way this game is going to get better is if others recommend me ideas, or let me in on bugs in beta builds.\r\n</p>\n<p>Documentation of versions:\r\n</p>\n<p>0.3.1 - New area, enemy, and slight plot progression.</p>\n<p>0.3.0 - New music for battles and new tutorial.
