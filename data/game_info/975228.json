As an exterminator, you step into a nuclear research facility to fix its bug problems with your extensive solution methods.</strong><br/><br/>Insects are famous for their adaptation and survival skills. A small push of radioactivity makes things a little bit complicated. They have outgrown themselves, gained new skills, and mutated distinctively. You must use your weapons wisely if you want to live.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You will have different skills that can be gained by defeating after bosses, but remember, you can use only one of them. Get a shield, slaying hoops, or a grenade to destroy everything. Choose the skill that serves you best.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the unique room and floor system, this game demands strategizing your path. You are starting on the ground floor and your main goal is to reach the top floor. You must survive every room and reach the floor boss to be able to reach the upper floor. <strong>Be careful if you die, you will go back to square one.</strong> But don\u2019t worry, once you unlock a floor, it stays unlocked. This allows you to reach the upper floor from the very first room. <strong>You can go final boss directly in theory :)</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Clear every room to reach the bosses. Defeat the bosses to reach the upper floors. Clean the whole facility to reach ultimate satisfaction.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T05:47:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/400583705db55faf130eb0578accc5e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emin Kagan KAYAK"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PiKa Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
