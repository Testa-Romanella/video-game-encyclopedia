Set in a creepy environment and wrapped in a suffocating atmosphere, the game centers on a unique premise: among your collection of dolls, which at first glance seem to be under control, hides an imposter with sinister intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a player, you find yourself in a constant battle against time and your own fears. Each doll exhibits different behaviors, some of which may be critical clues to identifying the impostor. However, discerning between harmless mischief and signs of true danger becomes an overwhelming challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game introduces an element of psychological survival: each time the guardian (the player) sleeps, the clock advances one hour. The tension rises as dawn approaches, with the goal of uncovering the impostor before 9 a.m. If by this critical moment, you have not successfully identified the only candidate as the impostor, you will face unpredictable and terrifying consequences, underlining the importance of your mission and observation and deduction skills.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Doll Impostor\" focuses not only on superficial horror but also deeply explores psychological terror, testing the player's ability to remain calm under pressure and make crucial decisions with limited information. With a richly designed environment, every element in the game, from the subtle soundtrack to the detailed graphics of the dolls, is designed to fully immerse you in this terrifying experience. Prepare to face your worst nightmares in this game where fear hides in the most unexpected places.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T06:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40a3bdcf5fbad0882af2b1940cca1f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeadArrow"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HeadArrow"], "esrb_rating": null}
