So they want to keep learning.<br/><br/>\u2605\u2605\u2605 What will my children learn? \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>Like all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free. Kids Preschool Puzzles helps children build and practice cognitive skills, visual spatial skills, shape recognition, as well as tactile and fine motor skills.<br/><br/>\u2605\u2605\u2605 What won't my children learn? \u2605\u2605\u2605<br/>The game does not overload children and parents with too many audio and visual stimuli. Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game. Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.<br/><br/>Although it's perfect for preschoolers, who just love the game, many children of kindergarten age and in the early grades also enjoy snapping the puzzle pieces into place and learning the 100-plus images (in the full version) the puzzles represent.<br/><br/>\u2714 Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn't teach letters, and the letters game doesn't teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.<br/><br/>\u2714 We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don't feature fun at the expense of education \u2013 or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don\u2019t involve and delight kids.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T14:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3a/c3ad0dd5aa6c07e888bc84cc5da58e4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Intellijoy Educational Games for Kids"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
