I've made art assets for Unity plenty of times, but up to this point I've considered myself weak when it came to the scripting aspect. This gave me a chance to use the API a bit more. The unfortunate part: I didn't have the time to add SOUND EFFECTS!! Next time I should be sentenced to making a sound-based game....  Hope that you enjoy playing it! Thanks for giving it a shot! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/2649ed4dff8a59fd1637fe947b2295ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P4thog3n"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
