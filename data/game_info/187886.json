It was developed in under 48h hours so dont expect something groundbreaking.</p><p>The game is called \"Warlock's Lair\" because you are a Warlock (same thing as a wizard) and you are attacked by a group of knights. Your job is it to defend yourself. To do that you have the ability to throw powerful Fireballs at your enemies.</p><p>==CONTROLS==<br/>RMB / ALT - Attack Right<br/>LMB / CTRL- Attack Left</p><p>Enjoy :D</p><p>-SadSmile-</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SadSmile"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
