{"id": 813576, "slug": "the-swordbearer-season-1", "name": "The Swordbearer - Season 1", "name_original": "The Swordbearer - Season 1", "description": "The Swordbearer is an adult visual novel (AVN) where you take on the role of a young adventurer who grew up with his best friend in a town called Riverfell. Your journey starts after the two of you apply to the Knights Guild at the capital - A prestigious organization that turns novices into formidable knights. Life as you know it changes when you wield the sword your mother left you. You and your party will be thrown into a world of adventure where you will get to make choices and decide the outcome of the events. Meet loveable characters and beautiful romanceable women as you explore this world that awaits you. Face the darkness that surfaces and uncover the evil plot as your story progresses.<h3>Romance</h3><br/>Meet lovable characters with different personalities as you progress. Create your own harem or take the path of monogamy. The choice is yours. The game will continue to be designed with both paths in mind.<h3>Optional interactions</h3><br/>Need a break from the plot? Go through some fun optional content. Future plans include side quests that you can do with your comrades that will not mess with the plot but add a layer of content that is completely optional. I highly recommend going through all the content.<h3>Bad guys!</h3><br/>What's a story without a good antagonist? Be part of the action and drama as the plot unfolds. The game will have multiple endings. Choices that determine these endings will be made available to the player at appropriate events during the game.<h3>Adult content</h3><br/>Adult content will come to you as you progress. The game also has animations for some scenes and the list will grow as the game progresses.<h3>Additional notes</h3>Although this game falls primarily in the medieval genre, I advise you to not take the tag too literally. While maintaining a strong connection to the medieval genre, this game is more playful in nature when it comes to speech for example. I personally find that limiting speech or certain elements to a strict medieval setting really limits what you can do in terms of creativity and humor. Please remember, this game is 100% fiction. The time era does not exist.<br/><br/>A final reminder that this game is in early access. If you feel like something is mentioned in the description but is missing, it probably means it's upcoming content. I won't commit to adding certain content unless I'm 100% sure.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T04:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00bb39ebb2f78e00d06f82be0438cc38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CaramelCowboy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CaramelCowboy"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
