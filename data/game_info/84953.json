{"id": 84953, "slug": "the-progeny", "name": "The Progeny", "name_original": "The Progeny", "description": "Greetings Commander,  and welcome to the Progeny.<br/><br/>The  Progeny is the pinnacle of technology on planet Gaia : an interstellar spaceship that will allow you to explore the wonders of the cosmos. <br/><br/>By the time you read this, Gaia is dying, and the people are forced to abandon it. Guide them through the solar systems and galaxies at the command of the Progeny. Explore the cosmos and help them find a new Gaia. <br/><br/>On board the Progeny you will find a genetics laboratory with a revolutionary technology . Use it to prepare the people of Gaia - the species of Fire , Water , Earth , Air , Cyber \u200b\u200band Spirit - for the planets where you will stop during your journey. Mixing your people with each other or with alien races encountered along the way , you will make them more resilient , better able to survive in conditions of increasingly inhospitable planets. <br/><br/>The Progeny also has an astronomical observatory. Here it is possible to scan the galaxy , checking the characteristics of the planet where you will suitable land. Using the observatory intelligently , you will be able to avoid \"impossible\" planets . <br/><br/>If you can spare the time , visit the Research section. Drilling under the surface of the newly discovered planets, you will collect the necessary minerals to produce prodigious artifacts. <br/><br/>Gameplay\u00a0:<br/><br/>Progeny is a game of exploration and space colonization where you fight for the survival of the species. <br/><br/>During your search for a new Gaia, you will visit many planets. If these planets represent a temporary shelter where you can develop your people in the genetics lab , look for artifacts , and scan the galaxy, they do not have the characteristics necessary for a lasting settlement. <br/><br/>On each planet , you have a limited number of generations before having to go to the next planet .<br/><br/>The goal is to intelligently use these generations, dosing time spent between the genetics laboratory , the observatory and research section.<br/><br/>The game has a virtually infinite gameplay\u00a0: unlock new costumes, meet all the alien races; look for all of the artifacts ; and in doing so , improve your scores! <br/><br/><br/>Origins - a brief genealogy of the Progeny Project: <br/><br/>If for thousands of years the people of Gaia - the people of Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Cyber \u200b\u200band  Spirit - shared the same planet, they have refused to evolve together. <br/>Living their separate lives, these people have developed however some traits from a common genetic heritage. For this reason, they were unable to find a perfect harmony within their home planet . And for that reason , Gaia began its decline ... <br/><br/>With heartfelt sadness , Gaia's inhabitants are resigned to abandon the planet. Their decline will be a lesson at least : it is by accepting and embracing the differences between species that they might one day evolve.<br/><br/>Project Progeny, an incredibly ambitious plan of exploration and interstellar colonization, represents the synthesis of knowledge accumulated over millennia by the people of Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Spirit. And the new Genetics Laboratory is the way that these people have found to overcome the millennia of stagnancy between their species lack of intermixing. <br/><br/>Now, Gaia's inhabitants realize their mistake and are willing to do what is necessary to survive. Lead them through planets and galaxies, guide them to a new home.<br/><br/>Good luck, Commander , may the stars watch over you !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/38123e64ed5844d855ef74172241f2fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Matthias Crevieaux"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Matthias Crevieaux"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
