Their stats can be customized via equipment, MAG feeding, and permanent stat boost items called Materials.</p>\n<p>This demo includes all Techniques available in PSO, plus some new ones that emulate the effects of getting higher level techs! It also has nine different weapon types with five tiers in each. There are five tiers of each type of armor as well.</p>\n<p>Forest 1 and 2 plus the boss are playable, along with the first of several quests, Maximum Attack 1.</p>\n<p>Originally, the game used mostly stock graphics and sounds, but I\u00a0quickly realized that the experience was greatly improved by having PSO sounds and music and enemy graphics, so I'm glad I took the time to finish adding all that in before releasing the demo. Not everything I\u00a0plan to include is in yet, however.</p>\r\nFuture plans!\r\n<p>This is just a demo showing off the game mechanics and the first of four areas. I plan to recreate all of Episode 1, hence the title. I do not intend to include storyline quests, or most actual quests, for that matter. Some may be based on existing popular quests, some may be all original.</p>\n<p>There are many more features that need to be implemented, including units, Photon Blasts, MAG evolution, weapon specials, and SPECIAL WEAPONs.</p>\n<p>One day I may convert it into a true local co-op version of PSO complete with character creation, Episode 2 and maybe even Episode 4. But right now the goal is to complete Episode 1 and get all the remaining features in.</p>\n<p>For more on current and planned features, please check out my first Devlog for this game here!
