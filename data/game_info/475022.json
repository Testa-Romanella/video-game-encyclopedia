Also fixed some other things that weren't working\u00a0in the previous build\u00a0as well.</p>\n<p>Play as a tank on a block of ice that protects you. Defeat enemies to increase score\u00a0while collecting ice cubes to make the ice block bigger.</p>\n<p>The ice block melts slowly overtime and every time you\u00a0fire your bullets.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse Pointer - Fire direction</p>\n<p>Mouse Left Click - Fire Bullet</p>\n<p>Hold shift - Increase Fire Rate</p>\n\n<p>Made for JDE Mid-Summer Jam</p>\n<p>Could've added more but I ended up spending too much time deciding between ideas. Had a hard time deciding whether to do a game about an ice block that eats smaller ice cubes to stay cool\u00a0or a top-down shooter where the cooldown is the basically your health and you have to manage that.
