Features graphics influenced by Limbo.<br/></p>\n<p>Join a young boy on his journey\u00a0as he attempts to piece together the paradox of\u00a0life after death. Has he found himself in heaven... or could it be hell?\u00a0Speak to a myriad of ghosts in order to learn more about their lives, their deaths, and their greatest regrets.\u00a0\u00a0Will he uncover this new world's\u00a0secrets before his strength runs out?</p>\n<p>*Submission to the\u00a0<em>I Can't Write But I Want To Tell A Story</em> game jam.</p>\n<p>The theme was '\"lost\".</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>Afterwards'</em> dialogue\u00a0is made up entirely of poetry.
