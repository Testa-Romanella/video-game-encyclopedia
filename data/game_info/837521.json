I've wanted to recreate at least a few bits of Race O Rama into a 2D sidescrolling space. Of course, this is wayyy less content than Race O Rama... hell, this one has one race. But I've tried to capture some of the feeling that Race O Rama has. Of course, this doesn't take place in the same world as that game, but because of engine limitations, this is the best I've could've done, worldwise at least.</p>\n<p>This game (or prototype) is really just a framework for how my own racing game would feel like. Of course, if you have any ideas for improvements, comment down below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faf07d847557e2eae641293748c5ca78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheReallyFake13Random"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
