In the daytime you explore the depths of the forest to gather its resources or you can stay within the safety of the village to construct or repair buildings and walls in preparation for the inevitable hordes of monsters which will attack you relentlessly. <br/>Choose wisely though on what you want to do! Every action you take costs stamina points of which you only have a limited amount of during each day cycle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong>\u2022 Survive, against all odds, by turning a bunch of (isolated) strangers into a close-knit fellowship. <br/>\u2022 Explore a huge procedurally generated Forest map with 600 tiles in size!<br/>\u2022 Asynchronous multiplayer, \u201cFollow\u201d mode, 24-hour day cycle<br/>\u2022 Play with Friends \u2013 Simply join your Steam Friends in-game, with no additional hassle.<br/>\u2022 Blitz Mode - Play a modified version of the game where a single day lasts only 15 minutes.
