You shoot enemies in a space invaders style top down mode, and also the camera angle changes, allowing for both brutal aerial warfare and fast paced cave flying action. The multiplier system makes you accumulate more points the longer you go without taking damage. If you take damage, your multiplier level is reset. Higher multiplier levels offer more points, but also increased difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c75b71a67ce5c0b8879647b3af92bc97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Advacardo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
