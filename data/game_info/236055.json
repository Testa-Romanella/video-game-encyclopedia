Throw the bananas at the right moment to hit the girl and boy gorilla. Each gorilla will change costume each time you throw them a banana. They\u2019ve got lots of funny matching costumes, so try to keep them matched up.<br/><br/>Make sure you don\u2019t miss a single banana, or the gorillas will get very upset and you will lose the level. The banana spinner will move faster and faster the longer you play. Can you keep up with the pace of the game and keep throwing the bananas in the right direction?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b96e410f9f17bf35e7c5e1bb4e360d34.jpg", "website": "http://comongames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ComonGames"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["ComonGames OOO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
