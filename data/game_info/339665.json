Its either time to clean up or have one of those deep conversations about life, the universe and everything that happens at 2am. I say we clean up tomorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it begins!</p>\n<p>We'll wind up exploring the universe, philosophy, theology,\u00a0science and toasters. Toasters actually come up several times, oddly enough. There are a few secrets hidden along the way, and before its over, tonight may change your life.\u00a0 Or you may fall to your doom. It depends on the choices you make.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy! And thanks for letting me be your Rent-A-Friend.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Creator notes:\u00a0Game can be breezed through in ten minutes, or you can take your time and explore. There are almost half an hour of audio\u00a0 (About 45 audio clips) scattered through the game by which to converse with Rent-A-Friend, and you will have to explore a lot to find them all. We suggest you walk through the game as directed/intended by Rent-A-Friend, then play Devil's Advocate, then just look around and explore. And enjoy! It's 2am and you're with a good friend.]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T04:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/467/467b617bf6e26e80e1aae1e56b2b68c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rent A Friend 2000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
