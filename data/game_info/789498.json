One problem...they're caught in a slowly collapsing time loop. Each time that the mother dies, the child resets the clock to a happier day. Unfortunately, each reset takes time off the child's countdown clock. In fact, the child loses a bit of time every time he casts a spell.\u00a0\u00a0If it reaches zero before they are successful, both will perish.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Engage the enemy with either a ranged or melee attack or choose to hold steady.\u00a0The enemy will block based on their statistics, so switch up your move!
