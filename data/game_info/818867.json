Die! Die! - This short puzzle game focuses on the random elements of the\u00a0six-sided die.\u00a0Build physics-based structures out of randomly chosen dice placed by the player as well as randomly\u00a0branched following the\u00a0set of rules below.\u00a0 Don't let your structure fall as you try and manipulated probability and randomness to get your structure to the finish.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>White die represent the starting die and any die can be placed on them. The value of placeable die represents the maximum number of adjacent die (1-6). A random die is chosen to be placed each \"turn\". When a die is placed it will spawn another die in a random adjacent space(out of six); provided that space follows the above rules. Spawned die will essentially count down to 1 by picking adjacent directions, as long as there are viable spaces. The goal is to build the dice structure to the finish without it falling onto the table below.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Rotate View: \"Middle Mouse Button\" + Drag:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</li><li>Zoom In/Out: \"Scroll Wheel\"</li><li>Place Die: \"Left Mouse Button\"</li><li>Recenter View: \"Right Mouse Button\" (On Die)</li><li>Reset Level: \"R\"</li><li>Continue: \"Space\"</li><li>Exit Game: \"Escape\"</li><li><strong>EXTRA(for game jam) </strong>- next level \"n\",\u00a0 previous level: \"p\",\u00a0 main menu: \"m\"</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:41:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc04e94cfbde6c8a2e2cbe15b9bc306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C4N4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
