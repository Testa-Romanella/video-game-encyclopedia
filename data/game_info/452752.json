This is a game that I jammed for a school art's project. There is not much to it, just kill things and upgrade.</p>\n<p>The ARROWS change your direction, the CIRCLE button is for jumping, and the SHIELD button is for, well, activating the shield, which recharges after some time. The enemies gain more HP every 5 rounds, so be careful.</p>\n<p>As for the UPGRADES, you can pretty much tell what they do, but I should explain that the shield one reduces the cooldown instead of increasing duration.</p>\n<p>This was my first game ever made and it was made on GameMaker Studio 2.</p>\n<p>So that's all. Enjoy the five minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/8503199b6d234e5e343008d018d2ba78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["HiddNSpace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
