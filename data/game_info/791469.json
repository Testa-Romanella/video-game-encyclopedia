The theme was \"Consequences\" and the optional constraint \"Strong Narrative\"\u00a0 was\u00a0used. When the game is complete, it will also include the optional constraint \"involves underground / tube trains\". You could probably speedrun the game in two minutes, but that would take away a lot of the fun of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Based around the Cornish myth of the Mermaid of Zennor,\u00a0<em>Zennor</em> has six playable characters, and follows two interconnected stories. Your actions in the past will affect the future. Interested in how to achieve different outcomes?
