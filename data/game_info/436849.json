{"id": 436849, "slug": "inverse-split", "name": "Inverse Split", "name_original": "Inverse Split", "description": "<p><strong>Inverse Split</strong> is a <strong>very </strong>short<strong> two button platformer</strong> in which you have to <strong>switch between parts of the screen representing day and night to collect all coins in a level</strong>. The longer you are in dark areas of the levels, <strong>the more tired you become</strong> before <strong>dying when your energy meter</strong> reaches zero.<br/></p>\n<p>You are only able to walk from side to side, but you can use <strong>arrows </strong>around the level to <strong>switch gravity</strong> in order to maneuver through the three black &amp; white levels.</p>\n<p>I added <strong>touchscreen support</strong> aswell, since the simplicity of the game makes it intuitive to move around by touching the sides of the screen.</p>\n\r\nTimelapse:\r\n<br/>\n\n\n<p>This game, it's music and graphics were entirely made in 3 hours for Trijam 67, even though I took a short break after an hour. The trickiest part was definitely designing levels with the way the gameplay is set up.<br/></p>\n<p>As always, feedback and critisism would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02f2b95caa1d8484ff1dc6a289ef4b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
