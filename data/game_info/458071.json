You will have to sneak around at night, you will have to break into locked buildings, you will even put together pieces of an ancient device to seal the tear between worlds, but most importantly, you will do all of this\u00a0<em>undercover</em>.</p>\n<p>Control the balance between doing chores around the commune to appear inconspicuous and gathering together the ancient device pieces, and socialize with the very strange folk of the commune.</p>\n<p>You only have one life, however! Do not let your suspicion rise to the point that the townsfolk will turn on you, or the world is truly doomed.</p>\n<p>Every town is randomly generated, and each new game you get a randomly received class that has a special bonus to use to your advantage!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Stranger Jam, and it was indeed made by 3 strangers:</p>\n<p>Stranger 1 - The Wandering Shadow - Artist, Programmer -\u00a0DeviantArt</p>\n<p>Stranger 2 - Tiny Tree - Concept Artist, Writer - @TinyTreeSap</p>\n<p>Stranger 3 - Marilyn Baumer - Programmer, Writer, Sound Design and Music - Bandcamp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:13:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/808bd1713cc7d4f69914427bfa356488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Space Bass Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
