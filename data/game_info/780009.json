Whilst working on our own game, we realised it would be easy for us to make a few changes to pay homage to one of the best songs to ever come out of the video game industry. <br/><br/>It's with a heavy heart that I (the lead developer) look back on Alec's death and with it the death of the ideas, music and feelings that we will never get to see, hear or know. However, when we stop to think of what was here before, Alec might be gone but we will remember. RIP Alec Holowka, you truly had a positive impact on the world, and it won't be forgotten.
