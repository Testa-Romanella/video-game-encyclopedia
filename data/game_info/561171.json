There is no time to think or waste: a rat\u2019s life means there is danger in each and every way. But one day, I had a dream: a dream for a better life, for me and my comrades; long, soothing spa baths; snacks made out of the rarest of delicacies; a professional rat massager available 24 hours a day; all of this and more, in my precious dream. Then I woke up. I couldn\u2019t pull myself together to continue this horrendous life. So I took action, gathered some of my friends and decided on my ultimate life goal: I would have the life of my dreams, in this luxurious human hotel, whatever the cost. No matter whatever it takes, or how long it lasts, I WILL risk my life for my komrats.</p>\n<p>SFX BY Zapsplat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adc8dd8059adf1f31274b79f209aae21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rusty", "fallthem000", "Satoshi Waku", "Naomi PK - @KREPEN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
