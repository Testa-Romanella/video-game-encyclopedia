Once your ball has been launched that's where the fun really starts! <br/><h3>Use Momentum</h3>Lots of momentum can be gained from the elements of each level. This momentum may be good at times, and others you might want to keep it slow and steady. There are a variety of ways to use and manipulate your momentum. Use it wisely and don't fly off into space! <br/><h3>Slowdown</h3>Sometimes the ball is just going too quick to catch with your mouse! That's what the slowdown mechanic is for. At any time during play, slow down the game to a crawl in order to select the next object with ease, and manipulate it with precision. In order to keep the game fun, there's no limit to how often you can use this mechanic.<br/><h3>Casual Gameplay</h3>Although some of the levels might pose a good challenge, this is a <strong>casual game</strong>. There is no pressure to complete every level and levels can be skipped at anytime via the level select. In addition to the ordinary level select there are also some extra-difficult bonus levels! Which can be unlocked after the ordinary levels for some additional challenge.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T05:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430b1dfd4b2c238973336f2c2cb40b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LukeMans", "Tyrant", "GuyKayJay"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tyrant Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
