This is a weird Solo developed Cartoonish style Spooky Search-n-Find Adventure Puzzle demo. With a bit of customization thrown in.\u00a0This game is very hard to describe in words, it's something you have to play for yourself. It's like a game, inside a game, with a game inside...<em>If that makes sense.</em></p>\n<p>You never know what you might find, so interact, and\u00a0look around everywhere.</p>\n<p>Basic controls, basic game premise, easy to follow storyline. Just Not so basic style, idea, or gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>Still early in the development stages, but I think it's ready for demo. It's not perfect, but not terrible either.</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be very welcomed in the comments. Any donations would be greatly appreciated it helps the game see a finish state that much\u00a0faster.</p>\n<p>-- FSR 2.1 coming in an\u00a0Update, Console support coming at a later date.</p>\n<p>Hope you Enjoy,<br/></p>\n<p><em>The Twisted Monk</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T07:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7990eda1d76508dc70deb85d5ba04882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twisted Bliss G.E.M."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
