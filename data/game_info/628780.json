Do you have a cousin who forgives racism as long as it comes from a sexy man?\u00a0How often does \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\" come up in conversation?\u00a0Put 'em in a bingo board and compete with your fellow lefty cousins to see who can eke a win out of these horrible conversations first! There's space to save up to 5 bingo boards in case you have Christmas with your racist uncle and Easter with your homophobic stepsister and get weekly calls from your aunt who only wants to talk about her new eggplant recipes. If your family is especially unpredictable,\u00a0 try the \"Random\" button, it'll generate random items \u2013 add the ones that might apply.\u00a0All your bases are covered!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm still not sure if the bad person this bingo board is for is you the player, or the people inspiring the board...probably both? Either way, enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T09:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf971cbb0104702d0f5289f3effc1a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DolorSitAmet-ish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
