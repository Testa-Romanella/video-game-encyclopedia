Here are the kinds of attacks you can expect to  stumble upon:\r\n    </em></p>\n<ul><li><em><strong>Damage </strong>- Straight forward. Deals damage to the opponent.\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Heal </strong>- Heals a dice roll amount's worth.\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Shield </strong>-  Fills up the user's Shield value. When attacked,\u00a0the Shield value will  take all hits until it hits 0. All Shields will reset back to zero at  the start of the user's next turn, though!\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Energy - </strong>On  your turn, you can play as many cards as you have in your deck- or as  many as you have the Energy to play. Certain attacks will try to suck  Energy from their opponents or give themselves more Energy per turn.\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Dodge </strong>-  Dodging allows the user to circumvent one attack completely. You can  activate multiple dodges to ignore multiple attack! Just beware: Like  the Shield, the user's Dodges reset to 0 on their next turn!\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Steal/Super Steal\u00a0</strong>-  Certain Enemies can steal your cards! This powerful tool only has one  usage each per combat encounter (although some enemies have multiple  \"Steal\" cards that they can then play once). A variant of Steal, \"Super  Steal\" also adds the stolen card to the Enemy's temporary deck!\r\n</em></li><li><em><strong>Poison </strong>-  A particularly nasty tactic used by strong fighters. Getting poisoned  adds a Poison Meter to your heart. At the end of your turn, you'll take  damage equal to the Poison Meter! But there's hope: After damaging you,  the poison gets weaker, until it disappears. Enemies can still try to  add more poison to the wound, though!\r\n<br/></em></li><li><em>There's many more new effects, from the spiky to the vampiric!
