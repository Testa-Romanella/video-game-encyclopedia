I am extremely new to development and I'm trying to test the waters with a concept that came into my head. The game is extremely bare-bones so expect bugs with the whole thing...</p><p>It's mostly a practical learning project for me but I try to do what I can with it.<br/>I hope you enjoy playing it.<br/></p><p>0.1.6 (BUILT 29/10/2016 : PUBLISHED 29/10/2016)<br/>- Revamped a few materials/textures.<br/>- Added weapon purchase areas. (Once displayed amount of points is reached they can be spent on buying weapons)<br/>- Added Ak69. (No weapon model yet, however)<br/>- Added version information in the top left corner during gameplay. (For reference to old screenshots and footage)<br/>- Added basic DeBug menu available through the pause screen. (Mostly for my testing purposes but anyone can use it if they so desire)<br/>- Added fullscreen toggle in Video Settings.<br/>- Added some filler to the Main Menu to make things a bit less plain.<br/>- Added button to open Itch.io page on the main menu.<br/>- Added auto-reload when the clip runs empty.<br/>- Lowered player mass and increased enemy mass further.<br/>- Re-Wrote stamina code. (This caused unity to spaz out and set all variables to '0', I can't exactly remember what they were before but I tried my best. )<br/>- CPU Optimization.<br/>- Fixed awkward bug where stamina depletes while holding shift, regardless of if the player is moving.<br/>- Improved Walker model.</p><p>Thanks to all for playing so far!</p><p>Big thanks to bpgmrcom, AurynSky and NarcosVsZombies for shouting out the game on their streams.</p> <p>Fixes and new features incoming!<br/></p><p>Read through my mind map for more info: https://mind42.com/public/4a0f38b6-c574-4122-a105-...<br/></p><p>CONTROLS<br/></p><p>- W, A, S and D to move.<br/></p><p>- SHIFT to sprint.<br/></p><p>- E to interact.</p><p>- Num Keys to switch Weapons.</p><p>- R to reload.</p><p>- B gives 100 points (Just for Dev Testing but is still in until I remove it on the chance that people feel a bit cheaty :P )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee4/ee4c50e72253504dab9277397c66141d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rytannic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
