Dispatched aboard the Airship <em>Erebus</em>, he hoped to drop in, throw some wind magic around, and return home to a life of luxury, a war hero. Instead, he's assigned to Flanker Section 33 where he's made to sweep the floors of the flanker berth, among other equally unheroic assignments. <br/><br/> On the frozen continent below, the Strikers of the Illanian Guard push back against a powerful invading army known as the Shuvur. With their brutal ice magic, the enemy has made significant advances into Illanian territory, devastating everything in their path. <br/></p>\n<p>Week after week, Tallara is left behind, deemed unready for combat. But strange events begin to unfold aboard the Erebus and his luck takes a turn when he, and two other misfits, Laverna and Magnus, are called to duty under a mysterious new squad leader, a beautiful Striker named Iris. Together, the four of them will dive from safety of the airship into the frozen world below on a special mission to end the war and reclaim their lost world.</p><p>Chapters one and two,  \u00a0Kinetic VN of 11k words<br/></p>\n<p>Credits\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Production\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Kevin Bomer\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Director<br/>Sandra 'SandraMJ' Molina\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Voice Director<br/>Sarchalen Team\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Production<br/>Able Kirby\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Staff Consultant<br/>Monochrome\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Art Coordinator<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Cast\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Kieran Flitton\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Tallara<br/>Madeline Dorroh\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Laverna<br/>Dan Gold\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Magnus<br/>Crystal Lee\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Iris<br/>Stan 'Stanpai' Kuschick \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0D'Aza<br/>Samantha Chan\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Sura<br/>Kameron Watson\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bentis<br/>Angela Tran\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ellis<br/>Kenkoy\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Intercom<br/>Ariane 'Starleeter' Marchese\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Reah<br/>Remi Flinterman\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ace<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Visual Design\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Momoca\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Character Design<br/>Kart Prowler\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Event CGs<br/>Erezu\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Environment Design<br/>Re.Alice\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0User Interface<br/>Kenta Chiba\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Logo Design<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Original Soundtrack\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Timothy Adan\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Dalton \"GRV\" Lafond\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Able Kirby\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Story\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Kevin Bomer\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Sakyawira\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Able Kirby\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Sound Effects\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Beneith The Skies is proud to use sound effects licenced through Creative Commons\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\"including recordings created by<br/>\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>heyim89yearsold*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0nextmaking**<br/>InspectorJ*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0mickfire*<br/>kangaroovindaloo*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0soundscalpel.com*<br/>timmy_h123*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Sauron974*<br/>32cheeseman32*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Huggy13ear*<br/>qubodup*\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0RICHERlandTV*<br/>\"and made available for public use by freesound.org<br/>\u00a0under the follwing creativecommons.org licences\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>*CC BY 3.0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0**Sampling+ 1.0<br/>All recordings were adapted from their original format\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Special Thanks\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Tom \"PyTom\" Rothamel\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Renpy.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T07:11:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc5609a2a046d72695a74d97cc933ef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sarchalen Visual Media"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
