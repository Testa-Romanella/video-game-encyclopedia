{"id": 435360, "slug": "ld46-frantic-factory", "name": "LD46 - Frantic Factory", "name_original": "LD46 - Frantic Factory", "description": "<p>You come into possession of a number of wonderfully cheap imported machines. They do the job, only... they can't turn off! Make sure that you keep the running machines well-fed with their desired materials or they'll freewheel out of control and destroy everything!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse-driven. The hotbar at the bottom of the screen allows you to select the standard cursor (factory crane, allows you to drag materials along the floor), belts/channels (drag with left mouse button held to draw them on the factory floor, right click/drag to remove), and the four types of machines (left click to place, right click to remove a machine that hasn't been turned on yet).<br/></p>\n<p>Ore will come in from a number of tiles on the left side of the factory, and on the right side there is a number of voids that will destroy any items that touch them. Originally there would have been some scoring system involving ever-changing supplies and demands presenting a challenge, but I underestimated gamejam conditions and had to slash most of the scope. Effectively, this is a rubbish sandbox with a fail condition that you'd have to go out of your way to trigger by removing belts from the initial setup or adding machines and intentionally starving them or laying out feed lines that snag things on walls etc.<br/></p>\n<p>The country of origin doesn't have safety standards so the machines will happily suck in objects from any direction when they are hungry enough (luckily you aren't a person on the shop floor!). When a machine wants to output something, it will use the first belt pointing out of it along its edge, starting from the top left corner and going clockwise until it finds one. It will jam horribly if you let it. Smelters can only output into channels which can only be a straight line to a forge. Yes the welder turns one rod into 4, multi-part recipes were slashed from the scope. I left some longer ladders around the map if you want to drag them along belts for a bit of amusement, one of them is even tilted so you can enjoy slide angles.</p>\n<p>Don't expect much from this, really. If you downloaded one of the desktop builds without knowing what you were getting yourself into, I'm sorry for wasting your bandwidth.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d065737ed8e3f9d93783df5850ba4967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Birdulon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
