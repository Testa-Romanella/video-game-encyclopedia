We spent weeks figuring out how to generate intricate and complex puzzles you won\u2019t find in other Sudoku apps. Our hardest puzzles require wild techniques like \u201cXYZ Wings\u201d, \u201cHidden Quadrouples\u201d, \u201cJellyfish\u201d, and \u201cSwordfish\u201d.<br/><br/>- Most people don\u2019t know this but Sudoku puzzles are actually generated by programatic Sudoku solvers. The fastest way to know how hard your puzzle is, or if it\u2019s valid, is to write a solver that knows all the strategies that can try it. With Good Sudoku, we run our solver as you are playing, so if you get stuck, it can detect what you know by looking at your answers and your notes, and then help you find the next technique you need to solve the puzzle.<br/><br/>- Most Sudoku games classify difficulty into vague Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties \u2014 But what do these difficulties mean? Typically they refer to the kinds of solving techniques that are required to solve a given puzzle without resorting to guess-and-check. In Good Sudoku we aren\u2019t vague about it at all. We lay out exactly which techniques are required for each difficulty level. Good Sudoku allows you to practice them individually outside of puzzles, and keeps track of which ones you\u2019ve learned!<br/><br/>- When we first got interested in Sudoku we noticed that a lot of players spend most of their time looking at the board and counting. On easy puzzles, this counting serves as a way to increase the difficulty by making the puzzle take longer. We know some sudoku players love the counting but we found it a bit tedious and designed some tools to alleviate the busywork. At first these tools might feel a bit like cheating, but once your mind is freed up from counting you\u2019ll have space to see the much deeper more fascinating side of Sudoku: all of the beautiful technique structures. Freed from the burden of busywork Sudoku becomes one of the best search-style games we\u2019ve ever played. More fun than word-searches and solitaire, high-level Sudoku is a real treat \u2014 and with Good Sudoku and a little practice, anyone can learn it!<br/><br/>- We noticed when looking at other Sudoku apps although there are often daily puzzle modes, those modes never include global leaderboards. Weird! Good Sudoku remedies this problem!<br/><br/>- We wanted to make the best Sudoku out there, and while we\u2019re proud of our puzzles, we recognize that puzzles come from all places. That\u2019s why we built a quick and easy custom puzzle mode into Good Sudoku, so if you have a paper puzzle that you\u2019re stuck on, or you\u2019re trying some wild variant (Like the Miracle Sudoku!) it\u2019s easy to put it into the game, play it, and share it with your friends. If the puzzle follows standard Sudoku rules, our hint system will even help you get unstuck!<br/><br/>We truly hope Good Sudoku can introduce you to, or deepen your love for this great game.<br/><br/>-Zach and Jack", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a70/a708f3b17ba97ab7fb22622fc6881fb4_GDdZcvr.jpg", "website": "http://www.playgoodsudoku.com/presskit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zach Gage"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["STFJ"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
