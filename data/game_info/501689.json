Have a screen at the begining of game where Player can outfit their ship with crew, shuttles, etc.\u00a0 and work on a \"treasure map\" mini game.. (basicly a raw image, I think or some kind of \"obscured\" mini map, that leads the player to a special location)..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now.. there's not much going on... no real gameplay.. but it will help you learn Klingon, especially the numbers.\u00a0 It SUPPOSED to be \"Oregon Trail in Space\".. but it's nowhere near there yet..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only 2 planets right now, for testing (the link below brings you to the version of the game a few months back done for a game jam, which is more buggy but less stripped down)</p><p>oops.. some of the on screen instructions are wrong... (consolidated all map data to being on screen at once.. so ignore the 6 and U keys)</p>\n<p>https://derrickmoore.itch.io/klingon</p>\n\n<p>Oct 5.. working on the interface.. getting variables like Crew and Honor in.. working on getting the canvas in, with options for different kinds of planets.. (actually, I'm working on trying to recruit someone to give me a hand with the game design this week)</p>\n\n<p>October 4</p>\n<p>fixed loads of errors, refined a few thinsg.. and stripped the game down some..\u00a0</p>\n<p>October 3rd late.. uploading a download and WebGL version</p>\n<p>Orktober 3rd.. havnt updated my Klingon game in months, and I've learned alot since then.. and the theme this week for the Weekly Jam is nice and gave me a good idea..\u00a0</p>\n<p>so.. gonna try and upgrade the game, maybe try and add some gameplay.... BUT... a treasure map.. that would be fun.. send a landing party down to the planet to hunt for treasure.. I think that's my goal for this week.. add \"treasure hunt\" to the game.. (which has no gameplay, and I cant even remember if the weapons work)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd620f50e94e765f537c1f835b2327ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DerrickMoore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
