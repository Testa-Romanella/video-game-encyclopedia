I want this game to be a meditation-like journey for players to experience alone. Therefore, although this game has multiple action game elements, dexterity is not the emphasis.<br/></p>\n<p>I really enjoy the process of making it. It starts with a purely random exploration that I found very visually pleasing. As I play through the demo over and over again, that metaphor started to emerge. I stick to this pipeline for later developing process. For each part, I\u00a0start with something simply looks good, and apply specific game play after I walk through the scene for many times. I feel especially happy for finally importing baked simulation animation from Houdini, which makes the finale so much better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T03:04:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be32c1d5a31b3f04d137935c4b676de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eleanor Jiaxi Yang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
