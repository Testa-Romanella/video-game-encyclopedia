You've got a lot of riders with a lot of problems, and only so much time in the day to try and fix them. How many relationships can you salvage while racing against the clock? <br/><br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>\u00a0Hover over each passenger. (Or click on mobile).\u00a0They will tell you some things about their partner. One trait from each of them will be incompatible with each other. Identify these two traits and suggest a course of action to alleviate the conflict. If you choose the right solution, the relationship is repaired! The couples will let you know how you did by leaving a review on your phone.<br/></p>\n<p>(You can change the background music by clicking on the radio at the bottom)</p>\r\nGame Jam Info\r\n<p>This game was created in under 48 hours for the Global Game Jam.
