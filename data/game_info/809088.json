They have three cities, each kept afloat by three rubber ducks. However, these ducks are growing tired of their position and are more frequently deserting their post! They're passionate about pizza, but that won't keep them satisfied for long.<br/></p>\n<p>Your duty is to put those ducks back in their place. It's suspected that, should a city sink, the remaining ducks will become distressed. We don't know what's wrong with Decal Duck in the middle, but he's equally as buoyant as the rest of them. It should only take 72 hours to evacuate the city residents, so just keep at it.</p>\r\nLeaderboard\r\n\r\nCredit<ul><li>Background</li><li>Duck</li><li>City</li><li>Quacks: 1, 2</li><li>Cursors: 1, 2, 3</li><li>Music</li><li>Icons</li><li>Font</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T16:21:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5120dc3c192deec9da58809c441671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["James", "Java Cake Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
