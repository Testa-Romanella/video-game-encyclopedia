Nothing that went into his [sic] total composition was unaffected by his sexuality. It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his actions because it was their insidious and indefinitely active principle; written immodestly on his face and body because it was a secret that always gave itself away. [...] Homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a hermaphroditism of the soul. The sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\" (1)</p><p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</p><p>(1) Foucault, Michel. 1990 (1978).
