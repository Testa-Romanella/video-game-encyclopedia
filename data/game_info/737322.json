We became friends and when I wanted to update my game, he reccommended me Ren'py, the engine that I used for the newest update, and showed me how to code. Just enough so that I could manage to do what you now have as The Golden Age in reimagined! It's a whole new game! :D</p>\n<p>So thank you jester for everything! And out of respect, I want to keep this game available for the fnia community since Gamejolt is now \"Family-Friendly\", so that your work won't get lost and forgotten! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-21T23:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a52a75b54366f0dfecabdf6ad4f5f28d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 18, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 11, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yuuto Katsuki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
