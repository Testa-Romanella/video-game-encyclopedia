To swim forward simply press the \u201cW\u201d key. To swim upwards, press the space bar. Watch out though! You can only press the space bar three times before having to swim near the sea bed again.\r\n  Help Magical Girl Halia stab the plastic trash into oblivion. If you see turtles choking on plastic bags, stab them too, in order to release them from their plastic prison.</p>\n<p>music by Lee Rosevere \"Thought Bubbles\"</p>\n<p>source:\u00a0\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/genre/Minimal_Electronic/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T09:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05d/05dcee0b90be1db0f7f6bd47c91b2d75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyenu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
