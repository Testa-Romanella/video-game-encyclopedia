Instead of being stuck in the living world, haunting innocents, you're here until you accept your death.</p>\n<p>To move on, you need to do the following:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Find a creature to kill you (check near the beginning) to overcome your fear of being eaten. Do this, and\u00a0I'll give you the speed you didn't have in life.</li><li>Find spikes to jump on (try and find a hidden area under a platform). Do this, and I'll hold you aloft for longer, letting you jump farther.<br/>\n</li><li>Find the edge of the world (you may need to find the spikes and creature first) Do this, and I'll give you an extra jump.</li></ol><p>Once you reach the flag, your journey has come to an end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T16:40:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21d/21d0848969d3b6488cd01c27fe986052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amorindis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
