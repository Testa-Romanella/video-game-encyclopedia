Take your pick! Pride Run has two game modes, Vanilla and Play Hard, in which you can face different challenges and approaches, all dancing to the beat of the amazing Hard Ton music.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Vanilla mode you\u2019ll follow the notes sequences along the streets of the cities where the most important Pride Parades took place in defence of LGBTQI rights. An intuitive control system for quick and funny classical rhythm action.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf, on the other hand, you want to lead the parade, Play Hard mode will let you define your tactics starting from the arrangement of the groups, the choice of the Leaders to line up, the type of truck\u2026 Along the path you\u2019ll move the segments of the parade and execute attack, defence and special moves. Lead the Bears, the Cosplayers, the Discos, the Drag Queens, the Femens, the Lesbians to have the people join in and to protect them from the Haters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the end of each Street View, if your parade is crowded enough and you have grown the required Pride, you\u2019ll fight the Boss, the most fierce Hater in town. Make Donald Trump, Hello Kitty, Putin riding a Battle-Bear(!) dance and defeat them in the rainbowest beat \u2018em up session ever!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e18fbff25bf5b29a16e3291bee457d0e.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/PrideRunGame/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IV Productions", "Steam Factory", "Hard Ton"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IV Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
