Previous shaders I've made, such as the reflection effect may not work properly. However, some shaders may work -better- such as the resolution cut for the retro plugin\u00a0I made. However, the composite effect is an example of one that breaks. It's not an issue with pixi, it's that it uses WebGL 2.0</p>\n<p><strong>Why upgrade?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Much, much faster performance (in theory) and better shader control. WebGL 2.0 supports many different built-in variables that shader developers can use to take advantage of. If you're a developer -and- a game designer, upgrade. it's easy.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Basically, the plugin downloads files from my server that have been edited. Thanks to\u00a0\u00a0https://fenixenginemv.gitlab.io/guides/pixi5-upgrade.html\u00a0for getting me started by showing me the basics of getting PIXI 5.3.0 running. There were leftover bugs, such as scaling and bitmaps not refreshing properly but\u00a0I've fixed those as well.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2bc5168534da1ef1bc7b24b8ac6fd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheUnproPro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
