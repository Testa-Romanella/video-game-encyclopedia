Fear not, here are a handful of cards with an alien\u2019s language on them to communicate what you need to everyone. Send messages to your allies by spelling words before the enemy can decrypt them. If your friends can\u2019t help you before time runs out, the opposing team can use that chance to swoop in and crack it. Whichever team deciphers the most messages wins the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Lost in Translation is a word party game for 3-10 players and ages 11+. I\u00a0worked on the game design and gameplay of this project. I\u00a0also put together a presentation to present to a publishing company.\u00a0 You can subscribe to the Tabletop Simulator Mod here:\u00a0https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2339425460\u00a0or download the rules and cards here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/37056401792a3cc4e7d73df8f6856212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen Hoffman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
