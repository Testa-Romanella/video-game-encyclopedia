Providing players with a different combat experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    For example, when reloading ammunition, the player is required to perform some operations (removing the old ammo clip, inserting a new ammo clip, <br/>\r\n    resetting the gun, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    Instead of just pressing \"R\" like in a traditional FPS game. These operations can better reflect the different performance of each weapon, and it is much more <br/>\r\n    closer to the real gun battle experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3. This design of the game can better reflect the characteristics of different weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    Just like every weapon in reality, these differences are not only reflected in the power, ballistics, and bomb amount, but also can make more different <br/>\r\n    experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    Such as weight, length, operational complexity, reliability and effective distance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n4. A rich tactical actions can be made in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    In the game, tactical actions such as sliding tackle, tumbling, over obstacles, bunker shooting, sideways, stun gun shooting, left-hand gun shooting, one- <br/>\r\n    handed two handed switching (pistol) can be made.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    The real weapon operation is combined with a variety of tactical actions, hoping to bring players a different combat experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n5. Realistic weapon recoil system.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    Players need to have better control over the muzzle. As the game time and experience increase, players will achieve better and better shooting results.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n6. Because there is a unique way to play, no other shooting game can experience the IPSC sport better than this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    The game provides a level closer to the real IPSC, making it easy for players to experience the practical shooting sport.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T02:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d19/d19c24381b9a2e2c96281bc09e4af9a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tan Zheng"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tan Zheng"], "esrb_rating": null}
