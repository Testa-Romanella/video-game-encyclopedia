They have\u00a0dragon-like fins on their heads and a tail.\u00a0They can often be seen driving in old abandoned RC vehicles that they often fix themselves or with the help of their Alien friends the Sneeds. Snurbs often live between the walls of various homes or in alleyways of downtown.\u00a0They often craft various gifts and projects and live peacefully with their friends.\u00a0Though these things are not seen here in this game it's important to remember that Snurbs have their own lives and world that they live in. Snurbs have the same problems and issues that you or I might encounter. Overworking, sadness, joy, happiness, regret. Though the Snurbs often affect a jolly demeanor they also have hard days and hard times.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52a/52a3695816f09339bdc1364970de2a43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NotRingoJingo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
