As time goes by the explorable area opens up more with new and more difficult enemies.</p>\r\nGet ready for the challenge\r\n<p>To progress smoothly with the game, the player is expected to master the new mechanics brought by the new characters. It is possible for the player to go and fight the final boss directly after tutorial area, however doing so will be near impossible without progressing and unlocking other characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3cf4bc43a9858a670ce5cc4f1f8ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["501Good"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
