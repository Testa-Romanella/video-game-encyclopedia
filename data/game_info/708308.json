{"id": 708308, "slug": "illumina-itch", "name": "Illumina (itch)", "name_original": "Illumina (itch)", "description": "<p>OK, this is it!<br/></p>\n<p>After having spent uncountable hours roaming the castle, or at least so it feels, trying to avoid being caught by the guards, which are now hot on your heels, you have finally arrived at the damp dungeon where the beautiful Princess Illumina is held captive. Catching your breath, you allow yourself a few moments to reflect upon your mission. First of all, you still haven't figured out how the citizens managed to talk you into taking this task upon you. Yes, the Princess is the hope and inspiration of the people, and without her to lead them they would never have built up the courage to revolt against the evil knight who has taken over the country, yada yada yada. But doing this for free doesn't quite go with your trade as a traveling warrior (your words). Most people would just call you a mercenary.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, you have entered the dark castle and after overcoming all sorts of dangers, some of which you could have been without, you are now standing in a dimly lit dungeon. The air is quite acrid and makes it hard to breathe. Princess Illumina is held captive behind the prison door. You are close, so close that you can almost taste the sweet taste of victory, another feather in your cap, another tale to be told around the fireplace at night.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DANISH:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>OK, S\u00e5 langt, s\u00e5 godt!</p>\n<p>Du orker ikke at t\u00e6nke p\u00e5 alle de timer du har tilbragt her i borgen, med at undg\u00e5 vagter, overvinde diverse f\u00e6lder og alle mulige andre besv\u00e6rligheder. Men nu er du her i fangek\u00e6lderen, godt nok med en flok vagter i h\u00e6lene, s\u00e5 din tid er kostbar. Det er her den smukke prinsesse Illumina holdes fanget.</p>\n<p>Du tager dig tid til, kortvarigt, at fundere over hvordan du har f\u00e5et dig rodet ind i dette eventyr. Hvordan er det lykkedes byens folk at overtale dig til, gratis endda, at fors\u00f8ge at befri den smukke prinsesse, om hvem det siges at blot synet af hende vil give folket mod til at bek\u00e6mpe borgherren. Hun er s\u00e5ledes deres eneste h\u00e5b om at befri byen fra borgherrens gr\u00e5dige enev\u00e6lde.</p>\n<p>Ikke desto mindre befinder du dig alts\u00e5 nu i fangek\u00e6lderen, og enden p\u00e5 din mission er n\u00e6r. Luften her er tung og \u00e6tsende, og g\u00f8r det sv\u00e6rt at tr\u00e6kke vejret uden at det g\u00f8r ondt i brystet. Prinsesse Illumina befinder sig bag celled\u00f8ren. T\u00e6t, s\u00e5 t\u00e6t at du n\u00e6sten kan smage sejrens s\u00f8dme.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T12:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c2780608c0114265d5e931f571d22746.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P/o.
