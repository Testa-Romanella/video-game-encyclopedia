(You can customize these, by the way.) Shoot the Troglodytes and collect the Coins to get as many points as possible!</p>\r\nBut here's the catch...\r\n<p>You can select which factors to randomize. These go from screen size, movement speed, maximum enemy count, to even something so seemingly niche and unimportant as wall jump horizontal repulsion. All of these can be customized to your liking, but more importantly... randomized.</p>\r\nA perfect recipe for chaos.\r\n<p>You can also choose your music and language (although for the moment, there aren't many... and only one used by real people...) In the future, I plan on adding texture pack and sound pack support, but you can already add your own music (as .ogg files) and languages (just copy and paste English.txt and change it accordingly).</p>\r\nFully customizable.\r\n<p>Made for GDKO Round 4, with the theme of customizability, by 89o. Music used is from \"Blackwhite Doublethink\" by misotanni, which isn't available anywhere at all right now. I have the only copy of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e101029da8bb9b3e2a39bf3ab999f270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
