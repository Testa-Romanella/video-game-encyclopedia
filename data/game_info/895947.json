It is a two-week solo project in NYU's Intro to Game-engines class.\u00a0 During the gameplay, players will have sixty seconds to beat up hordes of monsters in the world while cycling through four unique weapons. Compared to other top-down shooters, players in Weapon Master\u00a0do not have a classic health bar but will lose seconds if hit by the monsters, enhancing the core ticking-clock\u00a0mechanic of this six-seconds game. Will you be the one that collects hundreds of gold and coins? Have a try with your friends and see who collects the most amount of coins!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T17:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11d/11db731508e62f00095860a7353505e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HenkFan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
