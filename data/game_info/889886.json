{"id": 889886, "slug": "rocket-escape-2", "name": "Rocket Escape", "name_original": "Rocket Escape", "description": "Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal. Despite being around in gaming for a long time, rocket jumping is usually relegated to a side mechanic. However, we believed that rocket jumping could be so much more. Featuring mechanics such as slow motion/rocket time, speedrunning timers, black hole rockets, and more, Rocket Escape is an expansion on the time-tested concept of rocket jumping. We at Compact Square Studios have been working on Rocket Escape as a passion project over the last few years, and we are excited to be able to release the game on Steam and share it with the world.<br/><br/>We look forward to seeing how you approach and enjoy the game!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T02:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f5831bd54aa9d9c6b318365bf489f3.jpg", "website": "http://rocketescapegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Compact Square Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Compact Square Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
