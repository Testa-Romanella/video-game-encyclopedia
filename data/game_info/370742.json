In the main game you have freedom to explore each system, add ship upgrades, and level up the Custodian as you fight your way across the galaxy.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement: <strong>WASD</strong><br/><strong>LMB: </strong>Fire rail gun<br/><strong>RMB:</strong> Fire homing missile (targets closest enemy to cursor)<br/><strong>Shift:</strong> Speed boost<br/><strong>Z: </strong>Zoom In/Out<br/><strong>C:</strong> Toggle shields/point defence<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Aim of the demo:\u00a0</strong> Survive for as long as you can against an increasing number of enemies per wave. Unlike the actual game, you have unlimited energy, but keep an eye on the capacitor charge level of your weapons and missiles. The ships hull will slowly repair while in orbit around Arcadia. Don't stay still for too long though!<br/>The game auto saves after each wave. So you can exit and jump back in for more spaceship blasting action when ever you feel like it :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Points:</strong><br/>Enemy Ship = <strong>10</strong><br/>Bio Matter = <strong>2</strong><br/>Scrap Material = <strong>1</strong><br/>Using Missiles = -<strong>1!</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Tips:</strong></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>\u00a0<em>Shields recharge faster when powered down</em></em></li><li><em>Enemy missiles can be shot and destroyed</em></li><li><em>Point defence will protect against missiles but not lasers, so keep moving!</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Game Design, Programming, and Art</strong> by Luke Blackburn <br/>(Twitter: @OddSocksDev)</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong> by Scowsh <br/>(Twitter: @ScowshMolosh)</p>\n<p>Donations would be much appreciated and will go towards development costs for both myself and Scowsh - thanks in hopeful advance! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd4f2103947b5a603f01e681490484a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Odd Socks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
