Needless to say, I didn't have enough time spare to bring my plans to fruition.</p>\n<p>This game is *complete*, in so far as it could be called a game, I may need to finish my original game plan in future, as I enjoyed working on this prototype (lol) a lot.</p>\n<p>You are a Ghoul, escaping from a secret underground laboratory - they have been performing experiments with your blood - your energy source - but something has gone wrong, awakening for the first time in ages, you find a handy tool - GUN. With GUN, you can make you way out of the nightmare labyrinth of endless test chambers, towards freedom. As a bonus, your long dry hunger for blood can be sated with the destruction of your captors.</p>\n<p>Escape from randomly generated dungeons killing zombie scientists (who love to eat walls - awesomely deliberate A.I. :P), run and gun, and aim for a decent score :D!</p>\n<p>Warning; there may be bugs present, I'm confident that the dungeon generation works 100% of the time (spent ~25hrs of my time budget solely working out bugs and kinks in that generation) however I need to learn how to better optimize Godot engine games, as performance can become an issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a2c4fd7c24022be30fa2b34b96a219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnanix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
