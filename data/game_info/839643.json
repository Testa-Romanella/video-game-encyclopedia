Sometimes an attack is not genre-appropriate and will not be effective -- or\u00a0<em>super</em> effective! Go on and bring a gun to a swordfight!</li><li>Summon items: Add a helper monster to the game to slow down players. Also genre-themed. Sea monsters\u00a0in space is probably a bad idea.</li><li>Equip items: These are various buffs to you, the boss.</li></ul>\n<p>Users have 3 HP per game, and some number of quarters which they can use to revive their player and continue their game.</p>\n<p>If a player hits the end of the game, they'll walk away from the machine and you lose the rest of the quarters they would have spent on it.</p>\n<p>Once the user gets close to the end of the game, they'll try to fight through. If they do make it to you they'll cause you some damage.</p>\n<p>The machines to your back generate shields, which the player must fight through to get to you.</p>\n<p>When a player runs out of quarters or beats the game, they walk away.</p>\n<p>Once a game no longer has any interested players, it's powered off and its motherboard is swapped out with a new game, to attract new players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fb97ae4f892acef56777933e3806e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jason Scheirer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
