I would like to make this into a full game at some point (or at least with more than one enemy), but we'll see if I get around to that.</p>\n<p>This is about preparation and using the whole party to its greatest potential. Equipping everyone and setting their resource generation mode is important. The enemy will always act in the same order and target the same characters in its action cycle (though when it alerts you that the enemy is changing their tactics at certain Hp thresholds this will be a new cycle to adjust to). There are no variable amounts of damage, hit rates, critical chance, or whatever. If you do the same thing you should get the same result.<br/></p>\n<p>Party members can be switched through an individual character's Switch command, or by hitting Esc and switching out any party member with the Formation command. This uses an ATB system where 5 party members are active at once, but you have 99 total characters available. Many have passive skills and passive aura skills so try to keep track!<br/></p>\n<p>This build is very buggy and I tore some code from older games without much editing so please be patient with it at times. Please leave feedback and if I should try and expand on this at all, or if I should leave it be.</p>\n<p>Immediate thoughts for future updates: Make it so not all equipment is usable by literally anyone, remove Tp Modes that are irrelevant to individual characters, more enemies, unique character skills, actual maps to navigate.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4ed172d0618df95eb0af44706804a87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
