{"id": 706991, "slug": "opa-opa-xmas-adventure", "name": "Opa Opa Xmas Adventure", "name_original": "Opa Opa Xmas Adventure", "description": "<p>Hello, this is a small game, with a simple story, that I created as a technical practice, while I was learning how to develop videogames. At the moment, the game has only one Christmas level, with a boss (Santa Claus) that you will have to defeat twice, to complete the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>This game narrates the adventures of a little\u00a0 boy named Opa, who has the strange ability to travel in his imagination, through fantastic worlds that he creates himself.</p>\n<p><strong>The beginning:</strong></p>\n<p>The game begins in the winter, on Christmas night specifically on level 3. Despite having the ability to travel in his imagination, Opa possesses no other abilities of his own.</p>\n<p>To defend himself and advance, Opa relies on a mysterious character called avatar, a magical being that appears at his side, once he collects the four mythical gems, which were given to him after completing the previous 4 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>The four gems (power-ups) can extend the normal abilities of a human being. They are depleted by jumping or shooting and to recharge them, you simply have to stand still, while the energy bars recover.</p>\n<p>These gems are fused with the Avatar, who will be your adventure companion and you will depend on him and the gems to be able to attack and continue your journey.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you need to know?</strong></p>\n<p>1. To complete the level, you must collect all 50 coins on the stage. Then you can move on to fight the boss.</p>\n<p>2. The game may have some minor bugs, if so, please inform me.</p>\n<p>3. At the moment, only keyboard playable.</p>\n<p><strong>PC KEYBOARD:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Left/Right): Move player.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Left/Right/Up/Down): Move the helicopter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(X): Shoot/Attack</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Space): Jump (DoubleJump)</strong></p>\n<p>(<strong>Enter/Return): Pause</strong></p>\n<p>If you like the game and you find it interesting leave me your comment. I will gladly continue to expand the story and add 4 more levels.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Asset credits to:</strong></p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/</p>\n<p>Game Art 2D - Royalty Free 2D Game Assets</p>\n<p>Kenney - Home</p>\n<p>https://bevouliin.com/</p>\n<p>https://tokegameart.net/</p>\n<p>https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/</p>\n<p>Tools used: Gdevelop/Piskel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b85520f3f12a00d01792c463d425557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kurono Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
