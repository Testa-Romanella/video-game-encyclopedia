{"id": 289039, "slug": "hickory-dickory-dock", "name": "Hickory Dickory Dock", "name_original": "Hickory Dickory Dock", "description": "<p><strong>Hickory Dickory Dock</strong> is a game which has been made as a concept around the\u00a0rhyme \"Hickory Dickory Dock\" where you play as a mouse jumping around a clock and solving puzzles which include platforming, mazes and rhythm based mini-games. The player is to collect 8 pieces of cheese and return to the dancing cow to finish the game.<br/><br/>This project was done so as we want to further develop our skills around a more focused idea on a concept which was given to use from a random participant to further our skills in being handed a task and completing it.<br/><br/>Known issues.<br/>Due to an unknown anomaly and differences with the editor window and actual builds of the game the jump behaves very abnormally, this makes some puzzles frustrating but we do assure you its possible to jump.<br/><br/>Due to time restraints we were unable to finish the rhythm rooms which the player would need to enter the correct combination to finish and collect their cheese piece. With these gone we have made simple blocks so the player aren't able to enter them. sorry :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970645f31c9cadc1360df3d34c67bc81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kasumi0001", "Pale", "Timmytatt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
