You're an astronaut left to die on the moon. Don't worry, however, you're not quite alone there. There are zombies all around the place! You're only equipped with a laser blaster, so you're probably not going to survive for a long time, but that doesn't matter. Take your blaster and shoot as many of those green bastards, as you can, in your epic final stand.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That would be about everything I'll say about this game. It'll be completely free of charge, but you are always welcome to donate if you like my work. There's nothing else to say, give 'em hell!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T16:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b86a495be3ad6a3aecb5809f58523c7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cliffhanger Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
