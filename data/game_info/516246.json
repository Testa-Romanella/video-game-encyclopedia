I use Gdevelop engine to make this possible. It is a simple educational game to teach children about directions and increase second language learners' interest to learn English Language as well as certain special needs students such as slow learners. It is also created to increase their reading comprehension skill. Drop your comments below and feel free to write anything you want! I'm open to harsh criticism!</p>\n<p>*In case any of you guys pressed <strong>Esc </strong>at the last page,\u00a0Click Here so that you can see the assessment tab.</p>\n<p>*The game will take a long time to load, please wait and sorry for the trouble.<br/></p>\n<p>*Note that the <strong>exit button</strong> will not have any function because of the browser (it worked well on .Exe file). if you wish to quit the game, <strong>click on the \"&lt;- arrow\"</strong> button on the top left browser.
