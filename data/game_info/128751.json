In a team with students from Japan, Singapore, and Finland (plus me from Australia), we made a small game based on the theme \"AI - Artificial Intelligence\".</p>\n<p>We decided to make a game based around making a community of robots. They have personalities and moods of their own, and act according to both of those traits. Personalities are static, but moods change.</p>\n<p>Remember, this is a game jam game heh! Made by a team of people whose primary form of communication was Google Translate. :)<br/><br/>Check out the 30 second promotional trailer here. ^_^<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>ZhaoYuan (Lead Programmer/Robot Programmer)<br/>Shodai Ando (Programmer/UI Programmer)<br/>Shun Kato (Programmer/AI + Monster Programming)<br/>Lasse P\u00e4nk\u00e4l\u00e4inen (Designer/Art/Music)<br/>Penelope Davison (Designer/Art//Video)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8b7619086b442f5766a207317da345f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Penlovely"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
