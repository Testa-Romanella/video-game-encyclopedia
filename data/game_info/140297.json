To build one, click on it at the bottom of the screen, drag around the planet and click again to confirm placement.</p>\n\n<p>The factory will produce $6/s<br/></p>\n<p>The laser will fire at incoming alien ships, although the ships must be in its firing cone! Each laser has a firing cone of 60 degrees, that's 30  degrees in either direction. <br/></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this project was completed, start to finish, in 6 hours, and as such there is a high chance for lots of bugs! If you find any, feel free to tell me!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/563df65c0f81b0ae33599fbaf7b79c55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Incin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
