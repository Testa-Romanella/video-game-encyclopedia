It certainly could be improved and isn't particularly efficient, as the Mandelbrot is pretty resource-intensive in the first place, and this was made in GameMaker which isn't known for its speedy efficiency, however I'm happy with it.</p>\n<p>My main issue with the program is its zooming / panning functionality; I'd like to make it more intuitive, zooming into the position the mouse is hovering over when you use the scroll wheel like you'd expect, but this will require a fair bit more math and thinking from me to figure out.</p>\n<p>I'd like to record a cover of Jonathan Coulton's\u00a0<em>Mandelbrot Set\u00a0</em>as well, but I wasn't feeling up for it this jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d54ed02e57b9e3758dd4c67361392cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
