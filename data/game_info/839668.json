Your power is the ability to grow trees. You win the game if the forest tiles outnumber the town tiles and the desert tiles. You lose if the map is full before you reach your goal.</p>\n<p>Seedlings become forest in three turns. When they reach the forest stage, they cannot be destroyed and will start spawning new seedlings.</p>\n<p>Certain buildings will make the town expand faster: farms, mines, castle. For the town to have farms, it needs to have fields next to water. For the town to have mines, it needs to reach rocks or small mountains. For the town to have castle, it needs to be of a certain size and a tile completely surrounded by town tiles.</p>\n<p>Desert will expand if it is next to a deforested area.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move the camera with WASD or arrows. Place forest seedlings by clicking an empty grass tile.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T09:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd80682132fab54f052bedffa27b436.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TinyLootMachine"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
