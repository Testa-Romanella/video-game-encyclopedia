If this is the case, there is a Windows build available for download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You were served the death sentence for being too cool. In a dystopian cyberpunk world of neon lights and mechanical beings, you've been sent to the Arenas of Death to serve your sentence in full. They don't expect you to last long, but they've forgotten one thing about you. You're too cool to die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital Punishment 2: 2 Cool to Die is currently a simple top-down shooter where you fight off waves of robots and mutant cyborgs inside of a small city-themed arena while listening to some cool electro tunes. Use your gun to fight back the waves, pick up and use an explosive special,\u00a0and find medkits to heal yourself with. This is more of a concept demo for a game I wanna make in the future, and is also the first game I made with #C code. Up until now, I've only used visual scripting!</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Run</p>\n<p>LEFT-CLICK - Shoot</p>\n<p>RIGHT-CLICK - Special</p>\n<p>SPACE - Heal</p>\n<p>ESC - Pause/View Controls<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>*Follow me on Twitter (@GrapePaste)\u00a0to follow my gamedev journey and see what I'm currently working on!</p>\n<p>**Capital Punishment 2: 2 Cool to Die was made as a personal project during Create with Code: Live - Spring 2021<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:46:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84b602193bafb5d772b53d72ad1e1fa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jade"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
