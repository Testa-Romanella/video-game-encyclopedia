You will be constantly chased by the guards of Area51 and as you progress through the game more and more guards will spawn to try and catch you because you are becoming a bigger threat to the secrecy of alien presence on earth. You will have to run away from the guards chasing you and you are aided by the placement of portals around the area, using these portals will give you a chance at getting further away from the guards and to catch more aliens. On the side of the area there is the spaceship, this spaceship is where the aliens will try to run to at different points of the game. If five aliens get into the ship the game will be over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/054aea206117ab4a87646f36f14fcc47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PriestleyCGD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
