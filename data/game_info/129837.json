Originally we were going to have someone else help us for music but his computer completely died so he had some bigger priorities than GGJ. The game was supposed to be a lot like the game Kairo, where you walk through a mysterious region and have to reach the end. Unfortunately, Kairo had years of development and our game had slightly less than 48 hours. We thought the game worked out fairly well, but the very first person to play our game was a grumpy judge, who proceeded to declare he didn't understand anything and subsequently didn't enjoy the game. Hopefully you enjoy it.</p><p>Instructions: </p><ul><li>Generic FPS controls</li><li>R to restart once you reach a checkpoint</li><li>Go to the top of the pyramid by dodging blocks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/0808f84ced6296382d8097db18a862d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Impmaster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
