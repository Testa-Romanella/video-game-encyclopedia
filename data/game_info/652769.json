I had finished Ballistic Biscuit\u00a0and I was excited to create my dream. \r\n</p>\n<p>I did not know how to create a multiplayer game in Flash? I decided to start small and focus on the core features. \r\n</p>\n<p>Each player could give their penguin a name, chat, and explore a multi-room world. Experimental Penguins later evolved into Penguin Chat.\r\n</p>\n<p>I launched Experimental Penguins to the world in July 2000. I was surprised by the success, and have continued to create worlds ever since.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b7ef137f9c4d0c670e9734ef2d0d00a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infante The Penguin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
