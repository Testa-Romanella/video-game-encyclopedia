The creature cannot be hurt or killed, and it cannot be stopped-- but you (and a\u00a0friend!) are the only things standing in its way. Delay the inevitable by pouring bullets into\u00a0the monster to slow it down and draw its attention. Guide it to less populated buildings, keep it away from evacuation ships, and above all, don't let it destroy the power plants! Buy as much time as possible for the civilians to evacuate; see how many you can save!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The game is designed to be played in split-screen co-op, with one player using a mouse and keyboard and the other using a standard controller.\u00a0A single-player mode for mouse and keyboard is also available.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (Player 1) [Mouse and Keyboard]</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD (Hold): Move</li><li>Space (Hold): Interact (toggle roadblocks, shut down power plants, tell ships to depart)</li><li>Left Click (Hold): Fire Weak Minigun (hold for continuous fire)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls (Player 2) [Controller]</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Stick: Move\r\n</li><li>Right Stick: Aim</li><li>Primary Button (A on Xbox; Hold): Interact (shut down power plants, tell ships to depart)</li><li>Right\u00a0Trigger (Hold): Fire Strong Minigun (hold for continuous fire)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T13:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b7dcbe11f1c088a1725a07a03a2439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hawkbat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
