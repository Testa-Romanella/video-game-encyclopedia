This time, you're a neuron, that will have to go deeper and deeper into the brain to find the electric impulses the brain needs to think. But watch out for bad thoughts and brain damaging cells that will block your way.</p>\n<p><strong>-CONTROLS-</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Just click and move the mouse around.</p>\n<p>To start, touch any of the neurons below you when you spawn. They'll give you an impulse to find. Go find it and take it back to the neuron.</p><p>ESC to quit.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>- You'll need to know some basic stuff about the brain, the real one, like that the left part controls the right part of the body, and it takes care of more logical things, and knowledge, while the right part controls the left part of the body, and it takes care of creative things.</p>\n<p>- I'm very aware that there's a bug that usually triggers when taking back an impulse, and that it can break the whole system. All I can say for now is that I'm sorry. I've thought of a way to fix it, but I was running out of time to test it. When I'm able to, I'll try to make a new version fixing bugs.</p>\n<p>-Everything made by TheInkSkeleton (in paint.net and Unity2D)\u00a0in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 48 - \"Deeper And Deeper\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50c3931233b8d522ffc71fb8f3beada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["TheInkSkeleton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
