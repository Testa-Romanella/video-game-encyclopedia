Usage of mocaps, sound as a game mechanic and lastly, surrealism. We took the third option.\u00a0<br/><br/>Result was a bit creepy and surreal 2D platformer where we tried to portray each human sense whether as a game system or a simple mechanic.\u00a0However we only managed to implement touch and sight in the end!<br/><br/>ps: Special thanks to Grand Beats and Stroon for creating very uncomforting collage of sound and music which made the game even more surreal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Art </strong>: Samuel J\u00e1no\u0161 + Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ryb\u00e1r\u00a0</li><li><strong>Code</strong>: Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hus\u00e1r +\u00a0 Peter Wagner\u00a0</li><li><strong>Design</strong>: Luk\u00e1\u0161 \u010cul\u00edk\u00a0</li><li><strong>Sound&amp;Music</strong>:\u00a0\n<ul><li>Grand Beats Production (\u00a0http://grandbeats.sk/en/home-en/)\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Stroon (http://www.stroonmusic.net/\u00a0)\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8defbff4e2a12b50ad10b041c4408610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["neker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
