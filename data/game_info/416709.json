My name is Kevin Benavides and this is the first game I ever created. I am pretty proud of this game as I created it within a few months of learning game development.\u00a0I did most of the work that is seen here in this game, minus a few art assets and audio assets.\u00a0My game is a point and click adventure RPG where you take on the role of an aspiring adventurer as they work towards acquiring a contract and beginning an epic journey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, you must complete the beloved RPG tasks of stomping rats in a tavern cellar and defeating the local goblin who is hiding in a cave.\u00a0 You also get to enjoy various scenic backgrounds with over 5 in-game locations to experience. Additionally, each location is accompanied by music that I have composed myself. I also designed the UI for the game. However, I\u00a0am not a UI artist but I tried my best!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some quick tips for playing the game, all you need is a mouse. Don't venture into the goblin's cave without a sword! The goblin's skin is too tough for you to merely punch it to death. You can get the money for a sword though by helping the local tavern owner with his rat problem. If you take damage from the goblin, you can always venture back to the tavern to recover after you deal with the rats, because the tavern owner appreciates you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck with your journey's start!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:41:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d646b0f2623483d9c0e888c4652a542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Melons"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
