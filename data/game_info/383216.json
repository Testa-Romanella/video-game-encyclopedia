So you have to plan your<strong> jumps, solve puzzles, rescue Fairies</strong>, have fun.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The theme for the BYOG 2019 game jam was <strong>'T</strong><strong>o know what is right and choose to ignore it is the act of a coward</strong>'. We have incorporated a ninja\u00a0 theme because the quote was said by Hatake Kakashi who was a Shinobi and you can do things in the game which are difficult to do but not necessary to complete the level, to get bravery points. Also, our game, features quotes as subtle hints.<br/></p><p><strong>P.S - A small area in level 2 is little buggy and need extra efforts to jump on the platform (totally unintended)\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a9997e75492b81d0239de3d77aaf28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raj Aryan"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
