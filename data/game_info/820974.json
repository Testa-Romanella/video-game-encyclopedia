Each turn you have to roll the dice, once rolled, the dice will show which ball needs to be potted, if you pot this ball you can continue your turn and roll again. However, if you pot the incorrect ball, the BOT will gain a point, and it will no longer be your turn.</p>\n<p>See if you can beat the bot while potting as few incorrect balls as possible. Challenge yourself further by setting a time limit. Your time will be displayed when you win.\u00a0Good luck!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left mouse button</strong>\u00a0- menu interaction / lock cue</li><li><strong>Drag mouse\u00a0+ LMB -</strong> apply power to cue</li><li><strong>Release LMB</strong> - take shot</li><li><strong>Right mouse button\u00a0</strong>- cancel shot</li><li><strong>ESC\u00a0</strong>- pause / unpause</li><li><strong>R\u00a0</strong>- restart game</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Art by\u00a0Aleksandr Makarov\r\n</li><li>Music by\u00a0ORU Music\r\n</li><li>Sounds made with\u00a0BFXR</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/781/7812f6cdcf16db5edf4467a0a1401ce6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["David Harrington"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
