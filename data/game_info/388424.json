Cry no more - indie developer comes to the rescue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Snake7 aims to be a simple recreation of the original with just a few features added. You are in charge: make it a simple relaxing game while listening to music or go super competitive and try to buffer overflow the score (ha, good luck with that).</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Main features:</p>\n<ul><li>different types of food</li><li>special events called 'apocalypse'</li><li>a softcap after which the game gets very hard</li><li>snake color changes based on score</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Also strategies can be used based on food and timing:\u00a0 Aggressive (fast but risky), Casual (slow but safer) and everything in between.
