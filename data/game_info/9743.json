{"id": 9743, "slug": "unturned", "name": "Unturned", "name_original": "Unturned", "description": "<p>Unturned is a low-poly survival game providing single or multiplayer experience. The main action takes place on 6 different maps (Prince Edward Island, Yukon, Washington, Germany and Russia) flooded with zombies. The story begins in the random location of the chosen map and lasts till the death. Playing for one of the few people not yet turned into a zombie, you should stay aware of various natural or unnatural dangers, gather required resources, and make your way through the tough survival. Survivors meet thirst, hunger, disease, injures, zombie bites, and other hostile players looking for safety. Since land, air and sea vehicles are available, players can choose the most suitable transport to explore the entire map. The gameplay stands for the wider opportunity of customization of pretty much everything in the in-game world, starting with simple object destruction and following to guns modification and shelters construction. In-app purchases do not actually affect the gameplay, but due to the cosmetic system, plenty of items (clothing and weapon skins) are purchasable or available in crates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/93e/93ee6101e1c943732f06080dddb0fe4c.jpg", "website": "http://smartlydressedgames.com/", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 192, "owned": 6588, "beaten": 213, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 833, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 250, "ratings_count": 1060, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1062, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Smartly Dressed Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Smartly Dressed Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
