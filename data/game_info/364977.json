{"id": 364977, "slug": "unitower", "name": "uniTower", "name_original": "uniTower", "description": "uniTower is a deceptively simple \"micro-strategy\" tower defence. Play it for 5 minutes, play it for 500 - it'll be satisfying either way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere's only one tower and enemy type, so your score boils down to: 1) how well you can utilise powerful environmental effects when placing towers; 2) how complex a maze you build for the enemies; and 3) luck of the draw - how perfect your level generation was.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLevels are randomly generated as per a seed (except for tutorials/player created levels), so the fun comes in trying to find and master the elusive \"perfect level\". You are encouraged to share or borrow seeds from your friends/community, but the thrill is still present even when hunting alone.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor more crafty individuals, you can create and share your own levels simply by copying/editing/pasting JSON (instructions in-game, under Advanced &gt; Copy Example JSON).
