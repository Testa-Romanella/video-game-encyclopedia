While the city can do certain things on its own and major companies such as APS are making big changes to how it uses or produces energy, households and commercial businesses account for more than 12 percent of greenhouse emissions. In this role playing game you are a homeowner of a typical Phoenix four-bedroom, two-story stucco home. As part of a pilot program, you are\u00a0given $30,000 and six months to reduce your carbon footprint by 50\u00a0 percent. Can you maximize your reductions by replacing energy hogs for more modern fuel-efficient items -- and without breaking the bank? Can you increase your dollars by working the rebate game? Are there cost-neutral changes you can make that have big carbon reduction payoffs? How low can you go? Play to find out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:01:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/662936e9361c59760dd746616485fa00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nmiel"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
