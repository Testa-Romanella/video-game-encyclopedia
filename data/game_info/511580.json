You've heard of \"endless runners\"? Flea is an endless jumper. The character is always hopping, and you have to navigate levels while always jumping up and down. It's novel and kinda neat. \u201c\u00a0@IndieGamerChick</p>\n<p>\u201cYea, it's totally unique and interesting. It feels like it's made in the same vein of Super Meat Boy. Hell, you can imagine that flea actually LIVES on Super Meat Boy. Hey\u00a0SuperMeatBoy this should be made canon.\u201d\u00a0@IndieGamerChick</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's NES's Meat Boy/N+\u201d\u00a0@IndieGamerChick</p><p>Official Apparel through Red Bubble:</p><p>https://www.redbubble.com/people/lowtekgames/explore?asc=u&amp;page=1&amp;sortOrder=recent<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcba55a898b2b08f687619a2e766974e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LowtekGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
