The <em>Tree</em> is in danger, and you're its only hope of survival. Kill the <em>Termites</em>, collect the <em>Whirlygigs</em> and make smart, efficient moves to eradicate the pests as quickly as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe <em>Tree</em> is counting on you - don't let it down!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          The main menu screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Cast of Characters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Lilly the Firefly</em>, the protagonist and hero of our short story. You control the <em>Firefly</em> and with your help our little friend can save her home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>The Termite</em> and his army of pals are bent on making a meal of the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>The Spider</em> doesn't care about the tree; she's just hungry. Her favorite dish is <em>Termites</em>, but she won't pass up a <em>Firefly</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>\n<em>Lillybug</em> is a fast paced action/arcade game that takes a few minutes to play. Your final score is how quickly you're able to save the <em>Tree</em>, if you save it at all. It's a challenging and fun experience, and you'll need to make <em>very</em> efficient moves in order to succeed in your mission.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          The main game screen.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEach time you kill a <em>Termite</em> (by flying over them) the <em>Tree</em> will grant you a <em>Whirlygig</em>. Collect <em>Whirlygigs</em> by flying over them. When you have <em>Whirlygigs</em>, flying over infected parts of the tree will <em>Heal</em> it. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBoth the <em>Spider</em> and the <em>Termites</em> will snatch <em>Whirlygigs</em> away when given the opportunity.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Infected</em> parts of the <em>Tree</em> have a chance to spread the infection, so its vitally important to keep the tree as healthy as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFor every <em>Whirlygig</em> you collect, the resilience of the <em>Tree</em> will increase until finally the <em>Tree</em> is saved, and the <em>Termites</em> are defeated. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFor every tenth <em>Whirlygig</em> collected, a percentage of the tree will become completely resistant to the termites. The increasing resilience of the <em>Tree</em> will cause the <em>Termites</em> to become more frantic, which will cause the <em>Spider</em> to become more excited, so watch out!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAvoid the <em>Spider</em> at all costs! Getting caught by the <em>Spider</em> will cost you a life, any <em>Whirlygigs</em> you've collected, as well as precious time. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          A diagram of everything in the game.\r\n        \r\n\r\nGame Over\r\n<p>\r\nThe game can end in one of three ways.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Use all three lives</em>. If the <em>Spider</em> catches you, you will lose a life. When you've lost all three lives, the game will end.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Tree's health reaches zero</em>. The termites are constantly damaging the tree as they move across it. You must collect <em>Whirlygigs</em> to be able to heal the damage they've done. If the health of the tree drops below 50%, you'll hear a warning tone. Make efficient moves with <em>Whirlygigs</em> in your possession to keep the tree healthy!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Victory</em>. If you are successful in raising the <em>Tree's</em> resilience all the way up to <em>100%</em>, all of the termites will die and the game will end. Each <em>Whirlygig</em> you collect goes toward this goal. The time it took you to achieve victory is your score. The quicker you do it, the better!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Game over!\r\n        \r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing the <em>A Button</em> will send the <em>Firefly</em> across the tree to the other side of the screen, to land where the <em>Target</em> is located.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <em>B Button</em> performs the same function as the <em>A Button</em> if that's more comfortable for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Hold the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> buttons on the <em>D-Pad</em> to move the target to where you want the <em>Firely</em> to land.</p>\n<p>You can also use <em>The Crank</em> to move the target. You'll find an option in the <em>System Menu</em> to reverse the <em>Crank Direction</em> if you prefer it the other way around.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Lillybug in action.\r\n        \r\nHow to Install the Game\r\n<p>\r\nNot sure how to sideload games onto your Playdate?
