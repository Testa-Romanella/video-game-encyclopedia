It follows the life of a keychain-plushie that's been forgotten since the 90's. After taking refuge in a secluded shoebox, our bite-sized hero spends many years in dark solitude. Now, the tiny castaway sets off on a journey to seek the light of the outside world.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em>This promotional demo demonstrates basic gameplay, mainly the exploration and story-driven mechanics. Advanced gameplay such as the damage system and platforming aspects are not included since it's still in development.
