{"id": 269965, "slug": "spaceninja", "name": "SpaceNinja", "name_original": "SpaceNinja", "description": "<p>Welcome! SpaceNinja is a side project of mine I've been working on in college. Inspired by Megaman, Cuphead, Undertale, Kirby, and many more, SpaceNinja is a run-and-gun boss rush game. While you can only shoot and dash to the right, you can move in any direction and double-jump. Defeating each boss gives a suit augmentation that you can choose before each boss fight. All the music in the game is composed by myself using 8 bit sounds and soundfonts from a few games. The art isn't great, but I\u00a0promise the music and hopefully the gameplay make up for it! The game is entirely written in java, and I started it when I was pretty new to game dev, so it may not be optimized perfectly and sometimes chugs when it first opens, but give it a few seconds and it will run! Also, if you would like to donate towards my steam application fund, anything is appreciated! Feedback is also greatly appreciated.</p><p>Warning: this game gets pretty hard. just keep at it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c76e91d979a5e13b375dbaaab4ce231c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["musicknight"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
