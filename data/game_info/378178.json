This is a work in progress, but since the game is playable you can have some fun\u00a0\u00a0it\u00a0while I code it.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: \u00a0Subscribe to my feed in itch.io so you get the latest updates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard control:</strong></p>\n<p>S - starts the game</p>\n<p>Cursor keys to move the frog</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changes to the original arcade:</strong></p>\n<p>- a more forgiving collision detection (the pixel perfect system from the arcade really bothers me), so if the frog \"touches\" vehicles\u00a0by a few pixels you do not die instantly. yet, do not push your luck. :-)</p>\n<p>- Incremental difficulty as you pass each level is is more progressive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- No points for moving around. You get whatever points are in your time bank when you reach a goal.</p>\n<p>- Both the road and river have a fixed set of logs, cars, crocs, turtles, etc. This allows players to have some muscle memory when the game gets faster (and it does get faster).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next versions:</strong></p>\n<p>- Snakes on logs, some insects as bonus, crocodile appearing on the goal slots. I am not sure those really make the game better... we will see.</p>\n<p>- polish the thing... there are some glitches to fix.</p>\n<p>- I have some weird ideias I want to experiment with, as long as they do not ruin the game, I will probably make them optional.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d076c3261d2db6bce7c1ea62ad9057.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Paulo Laureano"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
