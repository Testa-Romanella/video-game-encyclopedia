One click launches your game into a VR environment that is a virtual giant stereoscopic screen, like a 3D home theater, then connecting to games that you already own and converting them from 2D into stereoscopic 3D to play on the virtual theater.  The screen is fully adjustable to your liking, including distance, size, vertical location, and 3D strength.<br/><br/>HelixMod VR does not convert your games into full VR experiences, you will still use your keyboard/mouse or game controllers to play.  The VR controllers are used to adjust the game theater to your liking.
