{"id": 887283, "slug": "air-defense", "name": "Air Defense", "name_original": "Air Defense", "description": "<p>Hello, everyone!</p>\n<p>The project was made for <strong>1-Button Jam 2022</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Air Defense</strong> is a project about <strong>Ukranian Air Forces</strong> that protect both my city and my country from terroristic air raids. I wanted to show how complicated it is to protect our sky when the enemy launches around hundred of missiles. Hope you will feel the intensity of the war! This is my interpretation of <strong>Resistance and Hope</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>According to <strong>1-Button Jam</strong>, the one and only rule is <strong>one button to control the game</strong>, and the button is <strong>Space</strong>: to press the Start button and launch rockets. That's all you need :)<br/><strong>Your goal is to destroy all air targets</strong>, launched by war terrorists, and protect the city from destruction. There are 3 types of air objects:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Recon Drone:</strong> a small drone that doesn't inflict damage but triggers other two types of drones to launch if it reached the city</li><li><strong>Attack Drone:</strong> a slow drone that will destroy Air Defense System (means \"you\") if hits it</li><li><strong>Missile:</strong> a big but quick rocket that inflicts damage to the city</li></ul>\n<p>Remember that you have a limited amount of rockets, so you will need time to reload the Air Defense System. <br/>Try to get as many score points as possible by destroying air targets. Misfires and missed targets decrease your score!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good luck and Glory to Ukraine!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T10:29:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1bb07fb03cfa4c19116f6b2e50a3839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Verianno"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
