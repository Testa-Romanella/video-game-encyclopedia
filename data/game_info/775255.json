And yet they keep going and doing it, <strong>again and again</strong>, despite the consequenses, hoping that one day their efforts won't be in vain.</p>\n<p><em>\"Russian police arrest demonstrator protesting with blank sign\"</em></p>\n<em>Citizens of the Russian Federation have the right to assemble peacefully, without weapons, to hold meetings, rallies and demonstrations, processions and picketing. - Russian Constitution.</em>\n\n\n<p>Be aware - the game is quite short, so don't get surprised if you reach the end in a matter of minutes or even seconds :P (Made in 48 hours)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls:\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Use <strong>A and D to move</strong> left and right.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\r\nPress SPACE to jump</strong>.
