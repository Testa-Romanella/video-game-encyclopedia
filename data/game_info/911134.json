(Very similar to games such as funemployed, cards against humanity and superfight.) Players can then discuss and debate which idea fits the brief best.</p>\n<p>The game has multiple ways to play, with additional round for iteration where players can change up their ideas with random cards, combine ideas with other players or create more constraints on the project briefs.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9ee49d34ccca524ddf15404c71347062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikethingsbetter"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
