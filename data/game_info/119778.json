The person who draws the last line that forms a square gets a point and the person with the most points wins!</p><p>Out Line goes beyond that and adds things like:<br/>- Multi-lines, which allows you to place patterns on the board instead of a single line.<br/>- Consecutive lines, which when placed on the board allows you to immediately take another turn.<br/>- Erase lines, which allows you to take someone else's square and claim it as your own!<br/>- Square shapes, which are four squares linked to each other. These give additional points and cannot be erased.<br/>- Null square, which when placed on the board ensures that nobody can claim the square it was placed in.<br/>- And much more!</p><p>Out last. Out play.
