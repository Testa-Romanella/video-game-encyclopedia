On each level, the player has to guide a group of bouncing balls from the right edge of the level to the left edge. The balls are constantly bouncing, and the player can only alter their travel speed (by moving the joystick left or right) or make them bounce higher (by pressing the fire button).</p>\n<p>Various different dangers appear on the levels, including sharp rocks, venus flytraps, hedgehogs and flying birds. The balls can also collect balloons for bonus points. The game starts with four balls, and each time the balls collide with a dangerous object, one ball bursts. If all four balls are burst, the player loses a life.</p>\n<p>The levels are themed as follows:</p>\n<ol><li>Normal back yard</li>\n<li>Beach</li>\n<li>Under the sea</li>\n<li>Ancient Roman ruins</li>\n<li>Forest</li>\n<li>Desert</li>\n<li>Arctic</li>\n<li>Spooky night-time forest</li>\n<li>Under the sea</li>\n<li>Up in the clouds</li>\n<li>Asteroid belt in space</li>\n<li>Alien planet</li>\n</ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a14745e1027af70e66831f508896ed9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Elite Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
