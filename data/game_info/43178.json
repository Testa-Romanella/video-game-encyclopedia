{"id": 43178, "slug": "batch-17", "name": "Batch 17", "name_original": "Batch 17", "description": "StoryIn Batch 17, you play as an un-named cloned soldier who wakes up in the middle of a violent resistance against the organization which runs the mining colony you protect. \"Born\" without any ability to speak, but with memories of your previous life, your quest for answers leads you to the resistance, where you learn that not only are you not alone, but that there is something very strange about this remote outpost. Led by a shadowy leader who seems to have a vested interest in you, fight through a variety of levels and environments to piece together the mystery of who you are, and the significance of the 17th batch of clones.MultiplayerBatch 17 is more than just a standard multiplayer player vs player game, Batch 17 incorporates various multiplayer ideas from other games and brings them into one great experience.<br/><br/>Instances in Batch 17 are full versions of the entire campaign of the game which are playable. Only your character stays the same regardless of what instance you play in.  Instances persist every change made, from boxes moved, to AI killed to loot picked up. Once a change is made - it is persisted until the AI respawns, or someone else changes the world.<br/><br/>By introducing this container form of instancing, we can allow you flag individual Universes (or instances) as player vs enimies only, COOP only or PVP Invasion.<br/><br/>It is only through PVP Invasion that you can reach the true end game of B17 - as levelling your character relies on skill points you can only get through EPIC mob encounters, made far easier with a large supply of online player universes to invade and explore.  You will only be able to invade other player instances if you are also flagged as \"PVP invasion\", ensuring that there's always people to invade.<br/><br/>These instances allow players to set up traps, defence, and protections against invasion and collect rewards against those who invade. Players can place turrets, move obstructions around, and set up defensive drops to attack other players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c4e59275159efe5f05c31284086b05.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/batch17game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Baffled Media", "Baffled Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Baffled Media", "Baffled Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
