It is a place of knowledge, but also a place of worship. It tells the story of our past, and serves as a warning for our people to not make the same mistakes as the ancients did. Our lands are protected by the 4 gods. They are our protectors, but they will turn on us in an instant if we stray from the right path. All that was left behind by the ancients to guide us was the grand circle. We must not leave it, or risk invoking the wrath of the gods.</p>\n\n<p>Created by:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christina, Eva &amp; Dani\u00eblle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02de2142736c8c1308181260cc936a22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moontowhee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
