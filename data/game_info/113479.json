It's a very simple game but I hope you'll have some fun with it.</p><p>In this Memory/Matching game clone, you find pairs of dinosaurs. The dinosaurs in the top section of the screen are running away from the meteorite that will kill them. When you find a pair, the corresponding dinosaur will sprint ahead to safety.
