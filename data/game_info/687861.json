At the start of each round both players will automatically walk ten paces away from each other. A countdown timer at the top of the screen shows the time this will take.</p>\n<p>Players can play fairly and wait until they have walked ten paces to turn and fire - their character has had the time to breath and concentrate their aim, so they will automatically hit their target. This is a test of fastest reaction time!</p>\n<p>How to <strong>REALLY </strong>play Ten Paces: <strong>YOU MUST CHEAT!</strong> Turn to face your opponent early, but take a moment to focus your aim by inputting the directional button sequence shown. The earlier you decide to turn, the longer the sequence of inputs you'll have to make. If you mess up your inputs you'll have to start the sequence over. The first player to complete their button sequence wins the round. <strong>You must wait at least one pace to turn (you have a little bit of\u00a0honour at least).</strong></p>\n<p>There are strategies to Ten\u00a0Paces: Turn early and accurately press your buttons. Or maybe wait for your opponent to mess up their inputs and then turn to have a shorter sequence of buttons with the same amount of time to press them. If you're confident that your opponent will not correct their aim fast enough, you can even wait the full ten paces like a gentleman\u00a0and turn to shoot them with no effort! Damn your eyes!</p>\n<p>P1 Controls (Red Player): <strong>Space</strong> or <strong>Left Shift</strong> to turn.\u00a0<strong>W</strong> = UP, <strong>S</strong> = DOWN, <strong>A</strong> = LEFT, <strong>D </strong>=\u00a0RIGHT</p>\n<p>P2 Controls (Blue Player): <strong>Right Ctrl</strong> or <strong>Page Down</strong> to turn.\u00a0<strong>Arrow Keys </strong>= Directional Inputs</p>\n<p><strong>Fullscreen</strong><strong>\u00a0recommended!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Menus can be navigated with WASD, arrow keys, mouse.

Other buttons must be pressed by P1 or mouse input.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Default difficulty is Advanced - this is recommended for most players as it allows for just under 3 inputs per second which creates a super competitive\u00a0game with a bit of practice.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Use the Main Menu to change difficulty. The difficulty option must be selected with mouse click or a\u00a0confirm input (P1: Left Shift, Space) (P2: Return, Enter, Right Ctrl, Page Down).\u00a0</strong></p>\n<em>Credits</em>\n<p><em>A game created by Monster Hammer Games for Leeds Beckett University Game Jam, October 2021.
