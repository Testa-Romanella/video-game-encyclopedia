{"id": 5565, "slug": "fear-3", "name": "F.E.A.R. 3", "name_original": "F.E.A.R. 3", "description": "<p>The third game of the FEAR series of games. The general outline of the whole line of these games is the confrontation of special forces, to be more precise, a soldier named &quot;Operative&quot;, and a squad of super-soldier clones who refused to obey their superiors. Rebellious clone soldiers are capable of even cannibalism, and other details of the setting correspond to this level of fear.<br />\nProtagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities, developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested, among other things, in the possession of ghostly forms, by which it is possible to mislead other people.</p>\n<p>The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode, the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode, in the game, is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood, which occurs in a person, in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way, then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug, which is included in the number of useful game stuff. Sometimes this mode is &quot;turned on&quot; during visions that visit the hero and act on him as much as the danger.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2011-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T20:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1da/1da9a7af524e81d257f972fbc06baefd.jpg", "website": "http://www.whatisfear.com/", "rating": 3.35, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 244, "owned": 3728, "beaten": 602, "toplay": 72, "dropped": 161, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 129, "ratings_count": 635, "suggestions_count": 575, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 639, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Warner Bros.
