Players will start in an empty cat rescue home, where they will gradually receive abandoned cats. Players must ensure the cats' stats are good to maintain their well-being. If a cat's stats decline, it will interact with furniture, causing a mess. As time passes, people visit the rescue house to adopt cats, providing donations to support the operation. The game offers a great experience of simulation of cat care, interaction, and management.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/21419331f619b7b1eca81c3e49cb69f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tecshield", "Else If Games Pty"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Else If Games Pty"], "esrb_rating": null}
