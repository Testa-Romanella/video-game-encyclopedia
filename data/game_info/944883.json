To be able to do that you need to port forward your router.\r\n<br/> Since this is my first time ever making a multiplayer game, expect weird bugs and report them back!\r\n  \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<strong>Goofy ahh horror</strong>\n<p>While this is yes in fact an horror game, most of the horror here is so goofy that you might laugh first before getting your first scare so don\u2019t worry about it :)\r\n  \u00a0 <br/><br/></p>\n<strong>Unique bots<br/></strong>\n<p>Not only there are bots who will just follow you but there is in total 4 unique bots with their own mechanics! But you will need to be the one to find who they are, how they work and how to survive them!</p>\n\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>W,A,S,D -&gt;Movement<br/>SpaceBar -&gt; Jump<br/>Ctrl -&gt; slowwalk<br/>Shift (toggle) -&gt; Sprint<br/>E -&gt; Interact<br/>Esc -&gt; (In-Game)Opens Menu<br/>Sprint + Ctrl -&gt; Slide<br/> <br/>\n</p>\n<p>The controls are NOT configurable but things such as the volume, mouse sensitivity and resolution are!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<strong>The Objective</strong>\u00a0\r\n<p>So literally all you have to do is find an annoying button to start the game and have fun wondering where the bots will appear from.... but theres something else<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>What are these and what do they do? please pull them if you know what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently 2 maps available: <br/></p>\n<p>Randomly generated backrooms map (where you can specify a map seed and map size!). <br/>Dev Map (map used for testing, no bots will spawn there)<br/></p>\n\n<p>More maps might be coming!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game exists because I wanted to try out that mod, realized I had no money to buy gmod and decided instead to waste months to make this game (I am very smart!)\r\n  \u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<strong>M</strong>ovement\r\n<p>You have complete control of your movement, slide jump, jump slide, air strafe... all this while keeping all of your momentum!</p>\n\n<strong>Die with style</strong>\n<p>Dying is boring, thats why you gain mach 2 speed whenever you die</p>\n<br/>\n<strong>And much more!</strong>\n<p>I really dont want to spoil the game too much for you...</p>\n\n<p>If you wanna find out more about this game why dont you give it a try? Bring some friends along too so the bots have more to play with :)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy! :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T14:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e44f9f43c87dba89cd104666b0dbdab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Besteres", "H3r3nT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
