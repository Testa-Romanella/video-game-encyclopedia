With easy-to-follow combat, and random items, treasure and enemies\u00a0to be found, luck and skill will be your keys to getting the highest score possible through this endless series of dungeons.<em><br/><br/>- 3 Characters to pick with different stats altering replayability</em></p>\n<p><em>- Random weapon pickups provide a fun challenge</em></p>\n<p><em>- A short experience that doesn't need overexplanation or lore or anything, just good old quick fun. Although, there is\u00a0a tutorial...<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>- Song remixed by\u00a0Disturbirds Music\u00a0- UNDERGROUND</em><br/><br/>The game itself is free, but you can donate to further support my work! Check my twitter\u00a0@ZweiLuke\u00a0!<br/><br/>This was a fun short project, and teached me quite a bit the ups and downs of Game Maker, but it was mostly made for fun, hope others enjoy, as i also find myself playing this short game for fun every now and then, seeing how far i can get. Do post your \"High Scores\", i'd be happy to see them!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T14:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/68421bf22d57ce41907a4403b66c531e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOKLUK"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
