This caused the main computer to malfunction. From now on, you are condemned to be cloned with each death, which blocks you in a loop of resurrection. Find the computer and destroy it, but watch out for hostile aliens on the way... In this retro-fps game, you can use your dead corpse as a mobile checkpoint after respawn.<br/></p>\n<p>For the Ludum Dare 47, we tried to make a Doom-like game with Unity. We are on a good start, but the project is obviously not finished. We had not much time and we where outruned by the difficulty of making a decent 3d game. You can't finish the levels but you can actually test the gameplay !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/882/8827366766594ec60edf69d945aa4938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Antoine Nisoli", "jcarly", "Blown-hobo", "Squayzzer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
