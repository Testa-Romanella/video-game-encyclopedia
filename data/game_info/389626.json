Then out of the nothingness came Erebus, the unknowable place where death dwells, and Night (Nyx). All else was nothing, empty, dark, silent. Then Erebus slept with Night (Nyx), who gave birth to Ether, the heavenly light, and to Day the earthly light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are the last of Erebus Sperm, and your job is to get to the Light Orb (Nyx\u2019s Ovum), and fertilize it before you died. You have 60 seconds of lifespan, and the Evil-Lava Sperm to avoid along the way. If you can\u2019t make it to the ovum, It means Ether and Day will not be born, and so the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Goodluck, survivor. The fate of the whole word is in your hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse Left Click : Fire Grapple</li>\n<li>Mouse Right Click : Release Grapple</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Objective : Find the Light Orb before the time\u2019s up.
