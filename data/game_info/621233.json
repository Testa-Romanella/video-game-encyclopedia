Instead of taking this theme literally,\u00a0 we chose to take it as a metaphorical connection. The player's actions are connected to the difficulty of the next levels.

However, in doing so, the difficulty of the next level will be increased. <br/>The purple enemies have 1 health and give you 1 point, the green enemies have 3 health and give you 2 points. Purple enemies are faster than green ones. Once you get your \"Required Points Remaining\" value to 0, you will proceed to the next stage.</p>\n<p>Things That Change With Difficulty:<br/></p>\n<p>- The spawn rate of enemies.</p>\n<p>- The speed of enemies.</p>\n<p>- Required points to beat a stage.</p>\n<p>- The size of the explosion your bullets make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95e7d54a013d6255a2c8e6eba067e567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Professor Pickles", "dr", "Ketchup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
