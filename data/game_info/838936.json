Not everything works in this game yet, there are still quite a few features missing but there is a bit of a core experience here.\u00a0 I ran out of time, and some collision properties were hard to get right.\u00a0 But I do have a product that functions, and if you want to rate me low on that, then go right ahead!! I'll provide some updates to the game later!!<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>You can use the gamepad, or the A/left and D/right keys to scroll through some of the options and select your code.\u00a0 To select, press E/left alt or the primary action button on the gamepad.\u00a0 The robot will update its position as you chose the code!</p>\n<p>I haven't tested this yet, but this game should work on all types of hardware, the lowest I got was an AMD A4 with HD Radeon graphics at 6 gigs.\u00a0 It does run using Wine with Linux.\u00a0 Actual Linux build soon to follow!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f344c353c9a906354af226a6634b5c1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superchocolatemilkshake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
