Also, we're taking big inspiration from the Football Manager and Total War series (heavily from Championship Manager 03/04 and Medieval: Total War). Our goal is to create a tactical wargame in a manager's setting.<h3>Be a Tactician</h3>You are a tactician. As a tactician, you must develop effective battle tactics that can win the battle.<h3>Real-Time Battles</h3>You can monitor the implementation of your tactics and intervene at critical moments.<h3>Scout</h3>To become a champion of the league, you must recruit leaders who are suitable for your tactic.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Training</h3></strong>Train your leaders so they can reach their full potential.<h3>League System</h3> Like in Football Manager, we have a league system. Where you can become the champion of the league and earn the title of \"Hakan\" - Khan of the Khans.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T06:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/0398bd70ae27c496113bf020cb090a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oba Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Oba Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
