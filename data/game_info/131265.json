Beware of stones which will break your wheels and of venomous snakes which can bite and kill your oxen. A wagon with a broken wheel has limited steering, so avoiding stones should be your priority. Also, you can shoot the snakes, but do not exhaust all your ammo too early!</p>\n<p>If you are lucky enough to come by a tent, you can get some help from the local Chief. The Chief will fix your wagon's wheel, if broken, provide one oxen, if you do not already own four , or give you five bullets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71a67480da462473d85e024e4300907b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tacratis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
