Getting hit by debris will cut your score in half, so watch out!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: Use left and right arrow keys to move on the left, and the up arrow key to jump on the right.</p>\n<p>HOW DOES IT FIT THE THEME: Both characters are stronger together since they must work together to achieve a good score. Without\u00a0jumping to hit the block on\u00a0the right the score cannot increase, but without\u00a0avoiding the falling debris on the left the score will quickly fall, so both tasks need to be done together to win.</p>\n<p>Hop and Run is a short but challenging arcade-style game made\u00a0by ynotDev using pre-existing art and audio. Submitted for the Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam. My first ever game jam submission!</p>\n<p>NOTE: Please be patient with the initial load time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da7/da73a34f7a3087f8b71f804bc736a7bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ynotDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
