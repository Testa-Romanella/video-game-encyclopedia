{"id": 262425, "slug": "atone-2", "name": "ATONE", "name_original": "ATONE", "description": "<p>The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader.<br />\nWith a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm.<br />\nPuzzles<br />\nAlong the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision.<br />\nCombat<br />\nViolence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song.<br />\nMusic<br />\nATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-22T04:10:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a252a5a49f8274f5c2715d059cfc313.jpg", "website": "https://www.atonethegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 18, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wildboy Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wildboy Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
