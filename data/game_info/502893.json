All assets except for the music in this game were given by the professor. The music is from Brockhampton's song FABRIC.<br/><br/>To play, use the left click to stop words from rotting the brain and right click to try and make a binary shield around the brain. Be careful though, the shield goes down very quickly and loads back up slowly.<br/><br/>Now you may be wondering what the heck this game even is :) And to that all I have to say is...brain rot lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90f4877abc59085e80e67ac4c78047eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["gensuta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
