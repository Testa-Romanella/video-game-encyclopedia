The green ball bounces upwards, continuously hitting the colored blocks while also being attracted by gravity. Players need to operate the red springboard to provide a springboard for the green ball, allowing it to jump continuously upwards. The more collisions there are, the higher the score. The picture is dynamic and the colors are brilliant. What are you waiting for?
