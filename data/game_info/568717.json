However, years of abandon means that the experiments inside are a completely unknown variable as you attempt to navigate towards the reactor...</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Wowie Game Jam 3.0, so to comply with the theme of 'Death is Progress', velocity is retained between lives. Place checkpoints high up, then jump into spikes to boost higher than ever before. Run into spikes to build up massive speed and make great leaps. Rattle off checkpoint jumps mid-air. The possibilities are infinite (but I only have so much time to make them).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>An OST written by yours truly (not entirely sure if that's a selling point or not)</li><li>An options menu (trust me, it's a huge improvement over my last game)</li><li>A ranking system - shave seconds, reduce deaths, and collect hidden coins to A-rank every level</li><li>8 levels that are easy to learn but difficult to master, and satisfying to eventually crush underfoot</li><li>The ability to skip levels - stuck on a hard stage? Skip to the next and come back later</li><li>Runs on just about anything - as far as I was able to gather data on, it works on anything from an RTX 2060 SUPER all the way down\u00a0to an Intel HD 3000 Mobile, 60FPS and all</li></ul>\n<p>If you're not on Windows or don't want to download, I apologize. I guess you can watch the trailer a few more times or something? GMS2's licensing is great but the upfront cost is huge.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues (Updated 3/2/21 12:45PM)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can get wedged in the bottom corners of terrain</li><li>Exiting out of the credits and going back to a level forces you to unpause the game first to play</li><li>Menu hover noises play twice when switching between some menus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>1.3.1 (3/2/2021 12:45PM) - Got the go-ahead from Jonas on Discord\u00a0to patch some of the nastier bugs; this is a gimped version of 1.4 without any of its polish improvements<ul><li>Next button now works as expected - no more having to exit back to the menu</li><li>Timer no longer accelerates upon playing certain levels<ul><li>Level par times have been adjusted to match this</li></ul></li><li>Fullscreen now works 100% of the time</li><li>Death sounds no longer overlap to deafening heights with bad checkpoint placement</li><li>Text Z-fighting issues with the pause menu in Traversal resolved</li><li>Splash text added with a cut down version of this changelog here</li></ul></li><li>1.3 (3/1/2021 2:27AM) - Figured out Butler to make pushing updates easier, pretty sick<ul><li>Added an additional spike in Super Sequence to make its final jump easier</li><li>Added 'next level' and credits screen in-game</li><li>Results and credits screen now have the same translucent backing as the HUD</li></ul></li><li>1.2 (2/28/2021 6:29PM) - Post-playtest update<ul><li>Level design tweaks and more lenient timers overall</li><li>Particles now show up\u00a0on death</li><li>Music tracks switch on death, placing a checkpoint, or collecting a coin</li><li>Translucent backing added underneath HUD elements to improve legibility</li></ul></li><li>1.1 (2/28/2021 6:01PM) - \"Stuff I overlooked but was able to fix in time\"\u00a0<ul><li>(Kind of) fixed the timer bug (it doesn't run double speed anymore, but it does run at half speed - kind of an improvement?)</li><li>Added fullscreen support</li></ul><ul><li>Remembered to remove (unanimated) eyes from player</li></ul></li><li>1.0 (2/28/2021 5:06PM) - Initial full release</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>sendhelpidfk - pretty much everything development-wise<br/>devlogerio#4768,\u00a0y!#1433 -\u00a0early feedback<br/>TheFriendlyHuman#4325, Blackstar#6824,\u00a0Tyche#6310, Mother_of_Steel#3868, !Prograde#0907 -\u00a0 playtesting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97c/97ca5b1ce4e935e6dd3859374c1bde08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sendhelpidfk"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
