Everytime they find themselves, this world rearranges itself making it harder and harder for the two to stay together. They need each other and your coordination for the two to join together for eternity.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Narrative, Art and animations:\u00a0Gustavo Tasca Pigosso</p>\n<p>Game Desing and programming\u00a0:\u00a0Bruno Dal'Lago<br/><br/>Music:\u00a0Luiz Felipe Dal Zotto<br/><br/>Project management:\u00a0Perceu Bertoletti</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18b66114b92faa751979e65ee53fab40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dallago"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
