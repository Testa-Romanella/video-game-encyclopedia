{"id": 921308, "slug": "wurzelwerk", "name": "Wurzelwerk", "name_original": "Wurzelwerk", "description": "<p>You are a young tree, freshly grown out of a seed. You\u2019re still small and vulnerable \u2013 it\u2019s time to change. Branch by branch you\u2019re building a network of roots by placing hexagonal tiles, reaching out for different sources of nutritions. How far will you extend your branch? How much energy will you save up for reaching into other directions? Will you try to prepare for the dangerous route to the bigger nutrition caches deep underneath or do you spread your network wide and shallow? How your tree changes depends on the decisions you take in the magical underworld of Wurzelwerk.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>- At the top of the screen you can see your tile selection \u2013 consisting of six tiles. To build a branch, drag one of the tiles on a spot connecting to your existing branches \u2013 in a way that connects your roots to the new tile.\u00a0You can rotate the tiles with the rotation button.</p>\n<p>- Every connecting edge of two placed tiles have to be of the same type: Branches have to connect to branches, stones-halfes have to touch stones-halfes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- You always concentrate on a single branch \u2013 You can finish building it at any time, but you won\u2019t be able to grow this branch further afterwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- After finishing a branch, you keep every tile you didn\u2019t use in your selection. If you have some unused nutrition,\u00a0you draw additional tiles until you have up to six tiles in your selection.\u00a0\u00a0You can see your current\u00a0nutrition value\u00a0at the top right.</p>\n<p>- But how to get nutrition: Hidden in the underground are caches of nutrition (blue tiles). If you can built your roots through one of those spots, you get additional nutrition. This nutrition allows you to draw new tiles after finishing a branch \u2013 and to evolve your tree further. Nutrition caches far away from your tree tend to be more valuable \u2013 but it will be a challange to reach them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0You can get a better overview of the realm of the underground by scrolling with the right mouse button.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>- The growing season and the game end if you\u2019ve spent all your nutrition and all tiles in your selection.</p>\n\n<p>Leon Matthes - Art\r\n </p>\n<p>Fabian Ferley - Game Design and Art\r\n </p>\n<p>Niaz Faridani-Rad - Programming\r\n </p>\n<p>Robin Hentschel - Programming\r\n </p>\n<p>Richard Webb - Sound Design\r\n </p>\n<p>Marius M\u00fclhaupt - Game Design\r\n </p>\n<p>DOOMTOALL - Writing and Voice Over\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours as part of the Global Game Jam 2023.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:37:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed871f6c34b48f93a5c7188230d86dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["flakysalt", "richard-webb", "wurzelwerkteam", "MariusMue"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
