This project has been fun to make, and in my opinion has turned out pretty decent (even if it takes like 2 minutes to beat).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project has been a learning experience. As you can very obviously tell, this game was supposed to be more. A lot more. But at the end of the day, the game is very basic and I lost motivation for the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But don't worry, I have not stopped making games! In fact, the reason I stopped development on this game is because of how passionate I have become for another project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, thank you for checking this out and I hope you enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/785/7858dd8d01c8cb9b518b202ff9217650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Out There Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
