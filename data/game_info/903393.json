As such, we inspired our gameplay off of that game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>for the sprites we immediately thought of minecraft as a game that brings back a sense of nostalgia, we had the idea of using minecraft inspired sprites for our game before we even had an idea of what our game would be!</p>\n<p>this game, like fireboy and watergirl is a 2 player platformer; unlike fireboy and watergirl, however, xGirl and yBoy is a 1v1 vs game, where you must race your friend to the finish instead of work with them!</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T08:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de31b52898573e457a1b322322594eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AniiSama"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
