You could starve to death down there... Or you could die to the abundance of spikes in this spiky dungeon full of spikes that are very spiky. Looting the treasure chests to buy items may be a good idea since nobody would dare to go more than a minute without something to eat.</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Spiky Dungeon was made for a 48 hour game jam. (The 4th Alakajam) I wasn't able to use the full weekend.
