{"id": 611028, "slug": "galdyr", "name": "Galdyr", "name_original": "Galdyr", "description": "<p><em>Galdyr</em> is a simulation game/software toy about dragons, magic, time, islands in a sea, and the people that inhabit them. However, you cannot control these people; instead, you can influence the world through magical means to either help or hinder them. Beware, however; using to much magic may cause more trouble than it's worth...<br/></p>\n<p><em>Galdyr</em> allows for a few different methods of play, including a randomized spell mode, a mode where casting spells will use up magic power, and a mode where you manually control an islander. However, it can also be rewarding to set up an island and just let the simulation run for a while.</p>\n<p>Along with the game itself, this download also comes with a manual to help new players learn how to play/utilize the game's systems. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:53:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35b/35b9f11e8146800e6e3132c6f1ee8de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
