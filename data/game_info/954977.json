Combat is attritional, it gets harder to win the more fights you find yourself in.</p>\n<p>3. Keep an eye out for secret areas. They may contain something that will make your journey easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Game</strong></p>\n<p>Made for the Dungeon Crawler Game Jam 2023:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2023\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme: The theme of the jam was Duality. So naturally, I chose to hit the theme in two different ways.</p>\n<p>1. In regards, to the spaces that the player inhabits as he moves through the game</p>\n<p>2. In regards to the player's motivations and the combat mechanics.</p>\n<p>And as an additional flavour, I also included a bit of symbolism in the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Kenney:</p>\n<p>Tiny Town \u00b7 Kenney</p>\n<p>Tiny Dungeon \u00b7 Kenney</p>\n<p>Adam Le Doux\u00a0</p>\n<p>bitsy.org<br/></p>\n<p>Aloelazoe</p>\n<p>bitsy-savior by aloelazoe (itch.io)</p>\n<p>bitsy 3d beta by aloelazoe (itch.io)<br/></p>\n<p>InThePixel</p>\n<p>Animated flowing water 2d 16x16 | OpenGameArt.org<br/></p>\n<p>Sean S.
