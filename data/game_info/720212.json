You play as a character, Alena, as she goes throughout her daily routines. There is not much to do, and there are very few maps relatively speaking,\u00a0but there is a fair amount of dialogue you can see when inspecting objects and people, particularly those found indoors. Aside from the intended message and expressing how these things feel, the main attraction of the game is most likely within its writing.</p>\n<p>Also of note is that the game has no audio whatsoever. I would most likely suggest putting on some form of music while you're going through it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This game has only been tested to work on Windows.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I have not been able to ensure compatibility with Apple or Linux devices at this time. I I am sorry if you are unable to play it because of this.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun! And thanks so much for giving this a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f2/9f2082d6f5cc08de0999df56a3d63d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taurmega"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
