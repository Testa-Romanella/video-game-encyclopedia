After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.<br/><br/><strong>Dusty</strong> is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!<br/><br/><strong>Rad &amp; Dusty's</strong> adventure begins in the First World, taking them through seven dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.<br/><br/>Features<strong>Weapons</strong>: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by. There are 5+ weapons in this first chapter, with more to come.<br/><br/><strong>Sounds &amp; Music</strong>: Our composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!<br/><br/><strong>The Pixelverse</strong>: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad &amp; Dusty to continue their journey.<br/><br/><strong>Classic Easter Eggs</strong>: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T23:26:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6bcb6613ea68f81201ed57f58e9da4b.jpg", "website": "https://www.radrodgers.com/", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 193, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 505, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Interceptor Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "3D Realms", "HandyGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
