{"id": 569666, "slug": "a-doctors-tale", "name": "A Doctor's Tale", "name_original": "A Doctor's Tale", "description": "<p>After returning home from a patient visit <strong>Doc </strong>is yet to discover that nobody is home and his house was ransacked. He finds a letter, which reveals that his wife and his daughter were kidnapped, by a <strong>Very Evil Kidnapper</strong>. He is blackmailed into giving in a <strong>serum </strong>he invented in return for his wife and his daughter. With his world torn to pieces, he sets out to find his family. <strong>You decide</strong> in which way you approach this journey. Anything between being a good and caring doctor and an evil douchebag is possible. You just have to live with the consequences...\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game plays like an action packed Metroidvania with difficulty boss fights, but with decision-based elements. The players have the possiblity to customize the character's abilities through powerful <strong>relics</strong>. In addition the players can express the personality of their character in various <strong>dialogs</strong>, which will have an impact on the game itself. The <strong>decisons </strong>the players make throughout the game can have <strong>small impacts</strong>: Being rude to an old lady will result in not getting a free map and later on having to spend money to obtain one, which might work a little different. But these <strong>decisions </strong>can also have <strong>huge impacts</strong>: Not recognizing that a man is possesed will result in killing an innocent and beloved son instead of the demon inside his head and <strong>Doc </strong>becoming more evil. This will lead you to a completly different path, since you will not get rewarded for saving the son you just killed, but instead you gain evil powers for taking the innocent life. Ultimately all the decisions made in the game will result in <strong>Doc </strong>getting reunited with his family. In one way or another...\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is recommended to play the game with a gamepad (Xbox, PS4), but keyboard input is also supported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc53c9a8b43deeebf0ab7bf8ae937783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FHerberGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
