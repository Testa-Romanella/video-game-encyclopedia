There are no more wars- only intense competition in Protoball.<br/><br/>Protoball is a futuristic sports game. Protoball is a unique blend of basketball and soccer crossed with high tech futuristic style &amp; competitive FPS gameplay. Players athletically jump, slide, run, flip &amp; dash their way around the arena trying to pass the Protoball through the opponents goal. <br/><br/>We are currently still in early development, and our vision for Protoball is grand. In addition to the core sports mode we intend to add Dodgeball and Laser Tag game modes. Protoball will have cosmetic DLC and customizable outfits &amp; VFX. No random loot crates for a chance at the item, you'll always be able to purchase the exact item you want. All purchases will be purely cosmetic and never affect gameplay. We intend to have a large and ever growing catalog of custom styles so that you can truly make your character your own.<br/><br/>Protoball will host official leagues and tournaments with some frequency. We're building Protoball from the ground up to be an eSport that hardcore and casual gamers alike can enjoy. We will always listen to, and value, our player base. Together we want to make Protoball the best that it can be.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7eefde00ee5ded123c308223a6724e31.jpg", "website": "https://protoballgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Z 3D"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Studio Z 3D"], "esrb_rating": null}
