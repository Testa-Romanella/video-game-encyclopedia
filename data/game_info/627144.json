I'm sorry about that!\u00a0</p>\r\nDescription &amp; Thoughts\r\n<p>I've been wanting to make something for the MashUp Game Jam\u00a0for a while, but I've had no energy whatsoever this week and I was gonna just not make anything\u00a0until I got a surge of inspiration and made this last-minute entry in 24 hours.\u00a0 It was a bit of a headache but really fun, and it was nice to just make something!</p>\n<p>I'm really sorry if this is very buggy, this is the second game jam I've ever joined and I'm still very new to this whole thing!\u00a0I tried my best, though!</p>\n<p>This was still really fun, though!! I've been ill and it was a nice distraction! I did stress a bit too much on the level design because I had so many ideas and so little time, but I'm still happy I managed to finish anything at all!</p>\n<p>All the sprites (or, well, most of them) fit in a 32x32 grid, and both the talk sprites and the overworld sprites for Cuckoo are 32x32! And making them was really fun!! Pixel art is fun and I have to do it more often!\u00a0Also, I had something in mind for the black &amp; white color palette, but I changed my mind halfway, though I still kept the palette!</p>\n<p>I'm still bummed out I couldn't make music in time, though. Aw man.</p>\n\n<p>All art and sounds made by me!\r\n</p>\n<p>Font used in the game is Press Start 2P!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e76be81a8c6c1a12e9023933a6888ac8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MayhemCats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
