Its build using the Rolling Ball Template as a base.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Your goal is to find and activate all the buttons in the level without touching an enemy (yellow balls) or falling into the yellow pit.\u00a0</li><li>After activating all buttons the light will turn on and the enemies will stop following you and will\u00a0be reset to their original size. After a few seconds of rest your score goes up by 1, the lights turn off and the cycle repeats but watch out, every time the lights turn off the enemies will grow faster.</li><li>Use WASD or the arrow keys to move and the space bar to jump</li><li>You can also change the amount of enemies (0-4) and buttons (no upper limit but too many impact performance heavily) in the options menu. Setting the number of enemies to 0 enables an \"easy\" mode without enemies where your only goal is to activate the buttons.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab30d694a697babfba8ce0a56fb4d683.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akiraktu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
