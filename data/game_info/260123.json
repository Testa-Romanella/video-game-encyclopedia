It is not so easy: your way runs over the clouds across narrow roads and air tracks or something like unconnected sky bridges. React fast, don't cross the edges of the field, lest you should slide down to the chasm! Intermediate results are saved by the checkpoints automatically - if you fall it will bring you to the last check point.<br/><br/>Every new stage will bring you new challenges: steep slopes and bends, dangerous areas, barriers - there is no time for boredom. Each level built with high level graphics quality, you could explore the world with camera zoom in/out view operation, and see more details.<br/>Be attentive and patient, and you will succeed in winning the game at the end!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>- slide the left screen to roll ball<br/>- slide the right screen to tune the view angle<br/><br/>FOLLOW US:<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brucegameX<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/brucegamex<br/>VK: https://vk.com/brucegame<br/>Email: bruce_game@126.com<br/>QQ Group: 643144794<br/>Blog: http://www.cnblogs.com/BRUCE-GAME/<br/>Support: https://brucegamex.blogspot.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:58:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e98f8de7e18b2d78becaf40051e6035_qBSeIsN.jpg", "website": "http://opencoder.blogcn.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["qinglin yao"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["qinglin yao"], "esrb_rating": null}
