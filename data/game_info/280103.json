His eyes were filled with fear and panic, so that nobody could doubt the truth of his words. To survive we left our village and are now travelling towards the coast and its harbours to leave this cursed country.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood Trail is a game about a small band of five medieval refugees who try to reach a harbour, fleeing a deadly plague. It was made for Ludum Dare 43 (Theme: \"Sacrifices must be made\").</p>\n<p>The game is made of two parts: a map view, where you can command your group across a procedurally generated world with forests, cities and plains and random encounters: while travelling through the lands, you will randomly encounter friendly or evil people, with whom you can communicate or fight.</p>\n<p>At the moment the game is rather a prototype and we appreciate every feedback we can get. The current version should provide a basic game flow and includes some features that were not finished in time for LudumDare. Our next goals include for example:</p>\n<ul><li>Extension of the Combat-System (especially more actions)</li><li>Extension of the Inventory-System (Armour, Food)</li><li>UI-Rework to be more appealing and accessible</li></ul>\n<p>To get an accurate and up-to-date view of our roadmap, refer to our issue list on github (https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120/issues).<br/><br/></p>\n<p>LudumDare Page: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blood-trail<br/></p>\n<p>GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Alfadas/pLD3011_2120<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FluffyVoxels"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
