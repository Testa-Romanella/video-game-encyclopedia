Here resides two kinds of spirits: angels, who work to atone for their sins; and spirits, who refuse to pass on due to their own regrets.<br/></p>\n<p>In a pursuit for reincarnation, angels perform varying tasks to ensure Heaven's functionality. Among them are reapers, who cruelly cull stubborn ghosts to further their own chances at crossing to the other side.</p>\n<p>Lucifer, tired of the way Heaven handles things, decides there's a better way to go about reaping.</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n<em>The currently uploaded version is at a very early stage for what he have planned for the rest of the game. This was done in order to meet the\u00a0\"My First Game Jam: Winter 2020\"\u00a0submission deadline. As such, player control is extremely limited, tiling is incomplete, dialogue flow can stutter \u2014 and so on.<br/><br/></em><em>The game will be updated over time, with three chapters planned. This demo includes about two-thirds of the first chapter. Our next goal, as of now, is to release a second demo which will include the entirety of the first chapter. Look forward to it!<br/><br/></em><em>Thank you for your understanding and patience. Though gameplay is limited at this stage, we hope you enjoy this small introduction for now.</em>\n\r\nContributors\r\n<p>Nine (@09tailes): writing, programming<br/>Nox (@ghost_shrine): programming, overworld sprites, map design<br/>Nawa (@41nawa): character + graphic design, talk sprites<br/>Nocturne: writing, sound curating<br/>Noa (@cethleanns): writing</p>\n<p>Music credit: M-ART<br/></p>\n<p>Made with RPG Maker 2003.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Feedback and bug reports are welcome, though please keep the disclaimer in mind in terms of functionality.</p>\n<p>Currently fixing:<br/>- text shadow interfering with legibility<br/>- missing NPC in cutscene<br/>- unable to interact with the librarian<br/>- passable walls and counters in library</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/9093ea38c9a8bf6db741a34dcb3cd83e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
