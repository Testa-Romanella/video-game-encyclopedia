You will make your way out of this prison by assembling the laser-helmet and equipping it for battle oh and technically you can beat the game without it good luck trying to find out how though! The laser on top of the helmet aims on its own and it only aims in the order of enemy's that it wants to so don't get ahead of it or you might get zapped by more than one laser! (and before anything is said I'm aware that there are only 2 crappy sounds in the entire game so I recommend listening to music or something while you play by the time I realized I was missing most of the audio it was too late but that's just how these things go\u00a0)</p>\n<p>To play online click here<br/></p>\n<p>(recommend you download for best experience)</p><p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets</p><p>https://polyhaven.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b57fe88753da2dc69c174766a1afc277.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["productivityishard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
