It feels like more of an \"Experience\" than a game seeing as there is no way to fail. Originally there was going to be a badger which you had to avoid, however, the more I worked on the game, the more I enjoyed the relaxing mood of just searching out slugs and leaves.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing this as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:15:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c293536997246436e723c0e41d95e0d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MichaelSollarsGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
