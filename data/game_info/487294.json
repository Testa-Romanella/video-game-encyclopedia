On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization officially named it 2019-NCOV.\u00a0 The common signs of infection with coronavirus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea. In more severe cases, infection can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. There is no specific treatment for novel Coronavirus disease.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will take place in a small city scene and there are some NPC in the scene who are in risk of being infected with a Novel Coronavirus. All players need to do is reduce and detect carriers through virus detection, social isolation, and wearing masks.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Once a carrier is detected, there will be quarantine, treatment and so on. The player's goal is to reduce the number of virus carriers in the city to zero.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The background of this game is the novel Coronavirus that is spreading wildly around the world. I hope that through this game, people can know more about the novel Coronavirus and do better personal protection. The advantage of games over popular science articles and videos is that they make it easier for people to accept knowledge in a relaxed environment.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/8317d1c5c5c13d5ac2929e3b2865b97f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zhuang.j"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
