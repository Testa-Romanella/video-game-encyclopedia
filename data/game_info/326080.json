In this game it is your aim to catch up with the other player in their territory and tag them to win! But be careful, don't get tagged on your side of the court, or you will lose!</p>\n<p>Developer note:</p>\n<p>This game was a tricky one to make for me, as I haven't tried split screen in Game Maker yet (not until now at least)! Although a little frustrating, I managed to pull through and get the split screen to work (with help from some tutorials on YouTube)\u00a0because without it, this game idea would probably not work as well (the game window would be huge, needing to cover the whole map!) I declare this feature a milestone for me, as it is yet another mechanic I haven't tried yet, and I pushed myself out of my comfort zone to make it happen!</p>\n<p>This fits into the Extra Credits Game Jam #4 Theme 'Connect' (barely) because you have to connect with the other player in the form of a game of tag.</p>\n<p>Other notes:</p>\n<ul><li>Player 1 moves with WASD.</li><li>Player 2 moves with the Arrow Keys.</li><li>You must touch the other player character in the game (on their side) to win.</li><li>Player 1's side is blue, Player 2's side is red.</li><li>Don't get caught on your side, otherwise you lose!</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you all for your time, and I hope you all have a great day today!</p>\n<p>- Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T20:18:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9b10271cf9d43b6d45ba5d415df95f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
