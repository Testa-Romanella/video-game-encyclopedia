The more things you have on you at the end of each level, the higher your score at the end of the game.</p>\n<p>My main goal going into this game was to produce something that looked visually striking and used high definition/ quality assets. While this means that the game is less polished than some of my other projects I\u00a0think it is the most impressive in scope and has a very wide range of mechanics. (inventory system, choice between throwing items to destroy enemies vs higher score, stealth, physics with the item throwing).</p>\n<p>It was also the first Shef Jam game I\u00a0made using Unity3D instead of Game Maker:\u00a0Studio.</p>\n\n<p>Xbox Controls (Reccomended):</p>\n<p>Left Stick - Move</p>\n<p>RT (hold) + Right Stick - Aim throwable item</p>\n<p>RT - Use Item</p>\n<p>LT - Pick up nearby items</p>\n<p>B - Drop Item</p>\n<p>Shoulder Buttons - Change Item in Inventory</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Space (hold) - Pick up nearby items</p>\n<p>Mouse 1 - Use/ Throw\u00a0item</p>\n<p>F - Drop</p>\n<p>Q +\u00a0E - Change Item in Inventory</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Owen Lyons - Code and Design</p>\n<p>Harvey Cash - Design, Art and Animation</p>\n<p>Calvin Smith - Music</p>\n<p>Art made in GIMP 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/89130c6a8ac2c81ec9fd00a6d1369c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DiabolicalSloth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
