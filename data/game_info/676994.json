The code was all done by myself, and the character and gun models were also done by myself, I did use an asset pack for the environment and for the skybox (links below).\r\n</p>\n<p>The game itself is an <em>FPS </em>where you assume control of a small robot called GR:1M, which comes equipped with two guns that you can switch between (by pressing 1 or 2). Your mission is to complete the cleanup task without letting the factory explode; this can occur if the instability level of the factory gets too high.\r\n</p>\n<p>If the instability level gets too high it's game over, but as the instability level gets high you also start to move faster and your weapons can cause more damage. There are several things that can raise the instability level of the factory:\r\n</p>\n<p>- <strong>Dying</strong>: if you die the instability level is raised;<br/>- <strong>Letting batteries overcharge</strong>: There are a lot of batteries in the level, you can tell they are overcharging when they start to glow yellow;\r\n<br/>- <strong>Hitting a damaged core</strong>: Damaged cores are red boxes, if you hit them they will raise the Instability Level, your enemies can also hit these boxes, so watch out.\r\n<br/>-<strong>Not killing enemies</strong>: The enemies in the environment will raise your instability level, so you better try and kill everything;\r\n</p>\n<p>But don't worry, you can also reduce the instability level, by:\r\n</p>\n<p>- <strong>Killing enemies</strong>: Killing enemies will reduce some amount of Instability, so yeah kill everything;\r\n<br/>- <strong>Shooting at batteries</strong>: When a Battery starts to glow yellow, you can shoot at it this will deactivate the battery and restore some of your instability;\r\n<br/>- <strong>Shooting at water tanks</strong>: Water tanks are\u00a0 blue boxes that when shot they will start a cooldown routine that gradually reduces your instability level;\r\n<br/>- <strong>Not Dying</strong>: ... ;\r\n</p>\n<p>You win when you clean the entire factory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets used:<br/>- Sci-Fi Construction Kit;<br/>- Fantasy Skybox FREE;</p>\n<p>This is my first time participating in a Ludum Dare and I had a ton of fun. I hope you enjoy my game as much as I enjoyed making it. <br/></p>\n<p>:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/68685b4ddfad873eaaf62ff9328d22ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Wyvex"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
