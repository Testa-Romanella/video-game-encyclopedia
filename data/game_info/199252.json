You start with a shuffled board of numbers and you must slide them into numerical order from 1 to 15. NOTE: Often the game cannot be solved - this even occurs in physical versions of this game you can play with your hands. I don't know how or why it can't be solved sometimes, but it's always at the end with 12 and 11 ending up in the reversed spots. I don't know what to do about it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48d/48d4108d7f5d6d6f8efc989cb4b5e6d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMP|Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
