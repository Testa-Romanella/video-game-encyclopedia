I gave myself one month to produce this, and I am pretty happy with the results. I hope my further projects are even more successful. This game was made in the godot game engine. Lovely piece of software that any game designer should check out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43e073ae3a3df844c26aed8b8d271f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ergo Doctor Hawk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
