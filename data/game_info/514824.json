Controls can be changed with the buttons in the bottom left. There is no game over just infinite pinball.<br/><br/><br/>if you are in the gravity of a blue bumper hold down the launcher button to deactivate its gravitational pull. Otherwise besides the double ended flippers its normal Pinball in the works!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Bug reports, and ideas are welcome! (things like The ball went through the wall and never came back or it got stuck)</p>\n<p>as well as\u00a0ideas like put a bumper here or a thingy there.</p>\n<p>anyone that would like to help make art for it is also welcome to join!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Update:10/30/2020<br/><br/>Point Panels are added have the ball roll over them to activate events, some are purely points. but others may alter the Pinball Board or even the ball.<br/>On a completely unrelated note BIGGER MODE is now a feature and yes if you get big <strong>YOU CAN GET BIGGER!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ALSO THIS IS STILL EARLY DEV I started this on the 28th of October</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T09:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1ec82050b1d205cd2dd57a9b4fd4feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bmaster4114"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
