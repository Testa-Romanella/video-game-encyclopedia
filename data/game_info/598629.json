{"id": 598629, "slug": "gunshield", "name": "GUNSHIELD", "name_original": "GUNSHIELD", "description": "<p>GunShield is a local multiplayer twin stick shooter battle arena game, where the players can battle against their friends with high tech robots that wield laser guns and laser reflective shields. <br/></p>\n<p>In GunShield players can pick a pilot to play as. Each pilot has different abilities called perks that help give their robot a boost in battle. Pick the pilot and perk that best suits your playstyle. Then you can choose a gun ranging from ARs to shotguns, and even sniper rifles to complement your chosen perk and playstyle. <br/></p>\n<p>Once everyone in the game is geared up, select one of four arenas to play on such as the Megadome or the Training Field and begin the battle. In the battlefield you\u2019ll need to swap tactically between your gun and your shield to survive. Aim your gun just right and watch as your laser bullet bounces across the map, but don\u2019t get hit by the bouncing lasers of other players. Swap to your shield when the time is just right to deflect their bullets back at them. Careful not to use up too much energy when shielding or shooting otherwise you\u2019ll have to swap to your other equipment while you wait for it to recharge. <br/></p>\n<p>Gain a point by destroying another player\u2019s robot or an extra point by being the last person standing. The first person to reach the designated point total will be crowned the GunShield champion!</p>\n<p>Notes: This game requires a controller to play. It is minimum 2 players and maximum of 4. Currently only a windows build is being supported. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c91/c91dfd2422a7dffb6408980c7fa23885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GUNSHIELDGAME"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
