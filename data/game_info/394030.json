In this game you are a character named Mike, and you must\u00a0collect various materials from around the game world to survive! To help get you started on your journey, I decided to make a guide and\u00a0list of controls that can be found in the download (README.txt). This was originally a midterm for college but I decided to take it a little further and see how far I could go. Please enjoy and let me know what you think! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71ce4ec31ae96e13ba549947257bda77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sauGameDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
