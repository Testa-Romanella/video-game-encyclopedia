Progress through room after pixel-art room, unlocking new guns and abilities, fighting bosses, and try to survive all levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will be hopefully releasing this game on Steam; this is a super early free demo so you can help guide and watch the process of\u00a0development through early feedback and suggestions.</p>\n<p>I'm an 18-year old college student looking to turn my passion of game development into a full-time job. Earlier this year I published my first Steam game after spending two full years in development\u00a0but I didn't know much about marketing and it didn't sell well. With this project I'm really trying to get the word out and build something you will truly enjoy because at the end of the day, this is what I love doing: building experiences that bring joy to your face. Entertainment for the world to see, not just for me to build in a dark room. So if you enjoy, please spread the word! You mean so much to me.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Player 1: WASD\u00a0 to move, Spacebar to shoot<br/>Player 2: Arrow Keys to move, Left-Click to shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f2b03cf812376ae56cd45bad08b25d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bennettapps"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
