{"id": 958830, "slug": "time-possum", "name": "Time Possum", "name_original": "Time Possum", "description": "<p>As you probably know, here at the Time Institute we\u2019ve built enormously expensive machines that generate ultradimensional wormholes and then create Einstein-Rosen bridges that allow us to exchange consciousnesses across time. We manage the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole generator by sending returning particles not to their universe of origin but to a parallel dump universe we don\u2019t care about. Since we\u2019re operating in Minkowski space, which is inherently non-Euclidean and lacks all the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, everything stays just stable enough. I mean it works, but don\u2019t ask too many probing questions.</p>\n<p>The downside to flavor-blasting the strands of time with virtual particles is that the consciousness\u2019 our clients swap with belong to an extremely specific non-sapient taxon. It\u2019s the Virginia opossum, Didelphis virginiana.</p>\n<p>You can ask me why and I can\u2019t tell you because we have no idea. That\u2019s just how time travel works. If you want to send your brain back in time, a possum must be waiting on the other side. I wish it were not so, but it is definitely so.</p>\n<em>Time Possum</em> and <em>Possum Time </em>are twin, parallel two-person games.\r\n<p>In <em>Time Possum</em>, you play a brave client of the Time Institute, transferring your consciousness into the body of a possum some time in the past.</p>\n<p>In <em>Possum Time</em> you play the possum whose consciousness has been kicked out, now in a human body in its own future. Just another weird day in the life of a possum.<br/></p>\r\nLogistics:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Participants</strong>:\u00a0Two, who take turns facilitating for each other.</li><li><strong>Time</strong>: Variable.
