This will influence your mood and choices. <br/><br/>There are hundreds of combinations, so the final assessment will be different depending on your view of the world at this point in your life. <br/><br/>Do you choose the colour because it is the one you want to choose, or are we artificially influencing your choices?<br/><br/>Maybe you are not the person you think you are and you have to accept a different reality. <br/><br/><br/><br/> FINIS is a puzzle game that explores 21 different universes. Each universe offers a different experience, terror, calm, destruction, war, progress... You can choose between 8 completely different paths and each path will take you to a unique ending.<br/><br/>- 21 multiverses.<br/>- 8 different paths.<br/>- Hundreds of results..<br/><br/>Once the game is finished, you can play again to discover the other paths and experiences, all of them so different that they will surprise you.<br/><br/>You decide which way to go, do you prefer progress or decline? Utopia or war? Discover that beauty can be anywhere, explore the limits of civilization, how far human beings can progress and how far they can go to destroy themselves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T06:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b0f66f4beb2ab6f46ae8ce0e2f5aed.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/K148_GS", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K148 Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JanduSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
