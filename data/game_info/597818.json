Collect ingredients to fill up your soup can and\u00a0progress through the levels. The game becomes\u00a0surprisingly therapeutic, listening to calming music while you empty rounds of ammunition at a small little can.</p>\n<p>Graphics made entirely using MS Paint for the 2021 Paint Jam.</p>\n\n<p>The game has three different modes:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><em>Campaign,\u00a0</em></li><li><em>Endless (easy),</em></li><li><em>and Endless (hard).\u00a0</em></li></ul>\n<p>We recommend starting with Endless (easy) to get a feel for the mechanics. Then complete the 13 Campaign levels.</p>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul><li>Tomatoes are stationary - Bounce your can into them to make soup</li><li>Onions move in a linear motion -\u00a0Bounce your can into them to make\u00a0soup</li><li>Mushrooms will run away from you! -\u00a0Bounce your can into them to make\u00a0soup</li><li>Chickens will run in random directions - Bounce your can into them to make\u00a0soup</li><li>Lemons need to be shot directly with the crosshair</li><li>Watches will slow down time -\u00a0Bounce your can into them to gain the ability</li><li>Bombs will hurt! Don't hit them with your can.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Use the mouse to navigate menus, and click on falling cans with the crosshair cursor. Once clicked, the can will bounce around.</p>\n<p>Press Space to pause the game.</p>\n<p>Press Escape to quit to main menu.<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Use only comic sans for any in-game font.\r\n</li><li>Draw your assets without a drawing tablet.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7c2a0829194299319c870000705d293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spicy Chicken", "Pixel Overload"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
