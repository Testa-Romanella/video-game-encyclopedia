This game was made in 4 hours, so there's only one level, and the art style is fairly juvenile. Thanks for checking out my game!</p>\n\n<p>My 2nd fully completed game, so I apologize if there are some bugs (like the untextured brick in the beginning of the level)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T08:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/53658b94ffb9ebbf8124c281a1d7e47c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["8ceDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
