{"id": 14671, "slug": "turbo-pug-dx", "name": "Turbo Pug DX", "name_original": "Turbo Pug DX", "description": "<p>Turbo Pug DX is an indie platforming game developed by Back To Basics Gaming. It is a spiritual successor to the original Turbo Pug with extra content.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>There is no plot present in the game. Turbo Pug DX resembles the classic platformers such as Super Mario Bros. and Sonic The Hedgehog. The players have to reach the end of the level as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>On their way, players will encounter various environmental hazards, such as spikes, water bodies, pits, and fires as well as a certain amount of enemies. If the players touch a hazard or an enemy touches them, it will result in an instant death.</p>\n<p>While playing a level, the players can collect letters scattered on it, as well as coins. These collectibles will increase the player&#39;s score and put them higher up the global in-game leaderboards.</p>\n<p>Players can unlock several pug skins as well as completely new characters, which are different in their movement and gameplay. Moreover, level skins are available for purchase. The game also comes bundled with a skin editor, where the players can create their own skins, send to the developers for approval, and, if accepted, get their skin into the game.</p>\n<p>The levels of Turbo Pug DX are procedurally generated meaning that no playthrough will be the same. The game also boasts a random weather system, which affects the level&#39;s environment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:37:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e84/e8442b92414884afac2c25622e7bd64f.jpg", "website": "http://www.BackToBasicsGaming.com/", "rating": 2.3, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 1149, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 26, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Back To Basics Gaming", "SnowFlame"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Back To Basics Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
