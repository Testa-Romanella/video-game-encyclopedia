You can punch and kill insects with tap touch controls so you can survive, but beware of being killed by them! The goal of this video game is for players to destroy these bugs as quickly as possible to protect themselves from other threats lurking around every corner, including more ants who have crawled out into your vicinity looking for food and powerups which increase their strength or give them new abilities such those beetles behind may be holding an ice cube over one eye giving it special powers like freezing targets or crushing opponents under its weight when they land. With so many bugs around, it can get frustrating but keep calm and try not to smash them all because with each insect killed, there's an opportunity of earning one point on top of what was gained before its demise! Choose between different environments: forest, desert wasteland, snow mountain range; each environment will present challenges.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/663/663c64e898f2102bb48189d6583d3a48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NapTech Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
