Use the power of nature to take back your land from the industrial invaders. Overgrow their mines and factories with flowers, grow forests and brambles to hold them off.<br/><br/><br/>You hold the humans off by expanding your territory and playing cards to grow your forests. The humans do the same by building homes, mines and factories.  Overgrow the other to conquer them!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Summer and winter come and go. With them they bring advantages and disadvantages to each side. Humans will need more coal in winter while your plants will need extra water in summer. Plan ahead and grow when the time is right!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The island is procedurally generated every session. The landscape consists of different types. There are deserts, marshes, geysers and more to make growing on the island more interesting. Discover it and use it to your advantage!<br/><br/><strong>This game was developed by 3rd year students at Howest - Digital Arts &amp; Entertainment during a period of 11 weeks.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T02:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/2356ed60f99b89fcd345edd59ca059b0.jpg", "website": "https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ken Redant", "Dave Van Verdegem", "Artemy Belzer", "Nioma Van Der Steen", "Tom Legrand", "Sandra Nikolova", "Niels Bernaerdt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Arts & Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
