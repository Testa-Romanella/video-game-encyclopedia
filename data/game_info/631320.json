An attempt to create a nice ambiance with sounds and images. There is no goal in this game. Its my first game published on itch.io :)<br/></p>\r\nControls: \r\n<p>Arrow keys. <br/></p>\r\nIssues: \r\n<p>On some older keyboards, only two arrow keys can be pressed at once. This is a limitation of the hardware. Try to connect another keyboard to get the fullest experience.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p> Keyboard keys assets modified from original visuals by Gerald Burke. Music made with BeepBox. I am grateful to GameDev.tv for their amazing courses that made this game possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd470ee7ad30fd1ae4b9494355b0227c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chroute"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
