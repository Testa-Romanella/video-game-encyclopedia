Or to shoot that bloody queen with your pawn? What about nuking the entire board with one missile?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>All of this, and more, is possible in <em>Chess Wars</em> - which is\u00a0</strong><strong>what happens when you take chess in one hand, turn-based battles in the other, then smash them together.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With each piece having a healthbar and stats of its own, you'll have to think twice before attempting to take down an opponent\u00a0- for you might lose your piece if it's too weak!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Collect the items spawning on the board, and use them to nuke your adversary, place mines, convert &amp; combine pieces, consume magic potions,\u00a0and much more!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Opting for a less deep but more complex version of the cult classic,<em> Chess Wars</em> is a game of chaos and surprises best enjoyed with a friend in local multiplayer, or alone with a simple AI.<br/></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Programming, Game Design:</strong>\u00a0<br/>Marcus Toma - aka\u00a0DT Mark, Clara Blonde, Nolwenn Deschand, Stefania Curila</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic Design, UI, SFX:</strong>\n<br/>Marcus Toma -\u00a0aka\u00a0DT Mark</p>\n<p><strong>Music: </strong>\n<br/>Aj Booker</p>\n<p>This game was a 2nd-year student project at\u00a0INSA Lyon, France.\u00a0It was made exclusively in Java using the Swing libraries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: The AI is unable to use items and has limited strategy thinking.
