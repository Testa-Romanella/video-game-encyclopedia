Death, disaster, despair.<br/><br/>This new installment in the Six Ages series is a stand-alone survival-storybook combining interactive fiction and turn-based strategy. The world is ending, and your small clan\u2019s survival depends on how you manage its relationship with the remaining gods and their followers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Managing your clan is complex, but may require you to:<br/><ul><li>explore the wilderness<br/></li><li>trade with (or raid!) your neighbors<br/></li><li>settle disputes mundane, spiritual, or political<br/></li><li>improve livestock pastures<br/></li><li>make offerings<br/></li><li>build altars<br/></li><li>travel to the Otherworld</li></ul><br/>Whether you\u2019re dealing with angry ghosts or clan policy, there\u2019s rarely one \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answer, because the deep simulation will make your particular situation unique. Remember that your choices have socio-economic impact, and your advisors often squabble amongst themselves, but some consequences might not be obvious for decades.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your clan struggles to survive in the world of Glorantha, one of the richest, oldest game settings ever created, perhaps familiar from other games such as RuneQuest or King of Dragon Pass. This bronze age world is facing an existential crisis as it undergoes a transformation. Ten generations after the events of Ride Like the Wind, some gods have already perished and humanity itself seems to be on the brink of annihilation. Here, the laws of physics themselves are subordinate to the whims of the gods and spirits.<br/><br/>In Lights Going Out, you can continue a game you began in Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind, or start a new story in this Great Darkness.<br/><br/>Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out is immensely replayable, with over 600(!) interactive scenes with multiple, system-driven outcomes. Short episodes and automatic saving mean you can play even when you only have a minute or two. The built-in saga records your story for you, while advisors help you track your promises, though their personalities will often judge your actions.<br/><br/>Miracles have always required sacrifice. Now, your people need them more than ever, but the costs are higher, too. Is it worth aiding the destructive gods of Chaos to ensure your own survival?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T17:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edcd951b0e5af582d3fe93e4e9ebfa58.jpg", "website": "https://sixages.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["A Sharp"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kitfox Games", "A Sharp"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
