I also plan to add a speed-run feature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE 1: There's a reloading bug\u00a0and I didn't have time to fix it, so if you get stuck from the second guy onwards (if you've mis-timed the time travel so to speak) then it's best to just walk into a spike to reset that level, pressing R will take you back to the beginning of the game unless you're on the last level in which case it'll take you back to the beginning of that level.</p>\n<p>NOTE 3: Audio may be slightly too loud generally, I didn't have time to add a volume control.</p>\n<p>All feedback welcome! :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Code, game design and art assets: Mike Bailey</p>\n<p>Free to use sounds from freesound.org under creative commons licence https://creativecommons.org/licenses/:</p>\n<p>140867__juskiddink__boing</p>\n<p>162493__tasmanianpower__vinyl-rewind</p>\n<p>202230__deraj__pop-sound</p>\n<p>255583__vikingpants__yep</p>\n<p>396458__patricklieberkind__futuristic-rhythmic-game-ambience</p>\n<p>435884__dersuperanton__cool-voice-vocal</p>\n<p>503498__larakaa__meh-03</p>\n<p>521620__lucas-post__electronic-bomb</p>\n<p>Free to us music from freesound.org under creative commons licence:</p>\n<p>412081__levelplane__shh-nes</p>\n<p>Font from google fonts:</p>\n<p>Rowdies-Regular</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/316d07b8c76af0d098fe1c9032ac01b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dutchlish"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
