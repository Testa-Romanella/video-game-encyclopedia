I love the metroidvania games but Across \r\nthe demon realm 2 is a Ghoulvania! (If you are looking for a \r\nmetroidvania you are not at the right place! )</em>\n<p>\u00a0Many developers have forgotten what makes a platformer game fun.</p>\n<p>In my opinion we must forget the giant and redundant labyrinths and go back to basics:</p>\n<p>a quality level design as found in games like <strong>ghosts'n goblins, ghouls'n ghosts and super ghoul's n ghost</strong> but easiest cause this 3 games are nightmare to finish!</p>\n<p>Many have tried to make games that are sometimes very pretty but \r\nterribly boring after having crossed the same levels over and over \r\nagain.</p>\n<p>I simply would like to make a linear platformer where the player \r\ncannot get lost as it is unfortunately too often the case in recent \r\nproductions.</p>\n<p>Only a button to jump and a button to attack, what's all! (No Rpg \r\nelements but a lot of weapons to grab! Sometimes you will steal the \r\nweapon of a defeated enemy! )</p>\n<p>So the game is very easy to play!</p>\n<p>Today, platform games (especially the metroidvania) have become like some open world games:</p>\n<p>gigantic games where you can go everywhere but which are often full of the same sort of monsters...boring and repetitive.</p>\n<p>I would like that the player does not get bored so the levels are less extensive, more linear but more varied.</p>\n<p>However this will not be a little game: Take the trainer version so \r\nyou can explore the whole game with the \"level selection\" and you will \r\nsee a lot of various backgrounds, enemies, traps, weapons to grab and a \r\nbig game made by a passionate of the golden age of the 80's platformers!</p>\n<p>To resume, like my best previous game \"<strong>Dogolrax</strong>\" with Team Shuriken, \r\nAcross the demon realm 2 aims to surprise \u00a0you in ways few games have \r\nbefore by introducing constant changes in environment, traps, monsters, \r\ndialog and plot twists!</p>\n<p>And you will never be lost in a gigantic level where all the walls are the same!</p>\n<p>You are the mysterious Darko whose face no one has ever seen.</p>\n<p>If you played to the first\"Across the demon realm\" you probably discovered that Darko was a demon.(Spoil: Let the female zombie kill you! )</p>\n<p>But you are a good demon! Play Across the demon realm 2 to discover the story of Darko!</p>\n<p>I would like to make enemies as varied as in the famous game <strong>Shadow of the Beast</strong>! By testing the demo you will see that I have already started on this path and I intend to continue like this!</p>\n\n<p><strong>System Requirements :</strong></p>\n<p>OS: Windows XP SP3 or newer \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Processor: 2Ghz \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Memory: 3 GB RAM \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Graphics: 1GB \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>DirectX: Version 9.0 or newer \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Storage: 500 MB available space</p>\n<p>(So it runs perfectly on old and\"slow\" PC)</p>\n<p><strong>Use the keyboard or a xbox controller to play</strong> (I don't try other \r\ncontrollers but if it's recent enough you should probably play! )</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Main creator : Choloco (some backgrounds by Ansimuz)</p>\n<p>Music: Makimak and sometimes Choloco</p>\n<p>cover: Shawli's Fantasy</p>\r\nPledge now and find out about Backer unique and limited rewards on Kickstarter!\r\n<p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/957008919/across-the-demon-realm-2-the-platformer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0ef9252c5b527eaa1a0fdfae3630d696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Choloco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
