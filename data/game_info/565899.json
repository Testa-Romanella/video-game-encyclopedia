It's time for Celia's Chicken Adventure, the adventure game where Celia has to make friends with all of the chickens. And she has to do it in 11 seconds!

I used this fantastic tutorial series from bridgs as a starting point for it, which was amazing for someone who has no experience of making a game or writing any code for anything.\u00a0 There's a menu screen, a play screen, a win and lose popup, and that's about it! The music is based on \"Hakkeyoi\", a song about sumo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T07:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381a75b8a9be997da4f855a2425c4306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bobu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
