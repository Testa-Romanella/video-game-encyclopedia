{"id": 131514, "slug": "shining-spirits-chapter-1", "name": "Shining Spirits: Chapter 1", "name_original": "Shining Spirits: Chapter 1", "description": "The Plot<p>A man who witnessed his world's government kill his family, \r\nsuddenly is now ruler of the planet as part of his growing empire. Doing\r\n all the things he hated as a child, he certainly gets his enjoyment \r\nfrom seeing other's suffer the same way he did. His reign is all but \r\nstoppable when a young teenage boy and his friends find a scepter in the\r\n woods. Not just any scepter, but one that belonged to this emperor as\r\n a memento of his happier childhood times. Weary of it's purpose, the \r\nteens take the scepter for further knowledge. They are then met with the\r\n emperor's henchmen, who attempt to get the scepter back but ultimately \r\nfail, which persuades. them to have a further look taken at the staff. \r\nAfter some research, they finally figure out that the scepter does \r\nbelong to the emperor. By the time they decide to return it, the \r\nemperor's army has already been given orders to eliminate them. Not \r\nknowing what to do now, they receive word that the scepter holds the key\r\n to a faraway ruin where all the secrets to the empire are held, and \r\nrevealing those secrets would end the emperor's reign and restore peace \r\nonce again. However, they have to keep their plan to find the ruins and \r\nsecret, as one of the group's father is a lieutenant in the military, \r\nand is on the trail for the people who have the scepter. Throughout \r\ntowns, villages, dungeons, and puzzles, will these likely but somehow \r\nodd heroes be able to uncover the truth of their authoritarian \r\ngovernment? Or will their ambition, good looks, and high intelligence \r\nget the best of them and come crashing down on them?</p>The Characters<p><strong>Lance Lagrand </strong>-\r\n a typical 16 year old boy with high ambitions about his life. Moving \r\nfrom the common village to a house deep in the woods, he maintains a \r\nclose friendship with Max and Hailey, whom he's known since he was able \r\nto toddle. Aside from only living with his mother, he typical finds \r\nsolitude in his treehouse that's far off into the forest and very large.\r\n He is a full-blood Eraski, just as as the others in his village are, \r\nwhich seperates him from his friends who are a mix of races and one who \r\nhas a birth defect that makes their hair red. He was voted number one in\r\n his class for perviness (rumor has it he was caught peeking into the \r\ngirls' locker room) and is thought to have a romantic relationship with \r\nHailey Myslin. </p><p><strong>Max Rygiel</strong> -\r\n once taken under the tutelage of penguins, Max Rygiel is a highly \r\nintelligent and nerdy individual. He is seen as weak by his peers, but \r\nproves to be very acquainted with physical combat. Max is a huge fan of \r\nNobeliumman, a superhero who has the ability to turn himself into green \r\ngoo with his gooeyness, and tends to be very creepy, especially around \r\ngirls. His father is a lieutenant in the Siobhan Army and can sniff out \r\nany trail of wrong-doers. Max and Lance have been best friends since the\r\n playpen and became friends with Hailey in the fourth grade when they \r\nwere assigned to a project on furry insects (of which Hailey was \r\nterrified of and Max even ate one) and despite Max peeking up Hailey \r\nskirt (which was no good since she was wearing shorts underneath), they \r\nremain friends to this day. Although Hailey highly disapproves of his \r\ncreepiness.</p><p><strong>Hailey Myslin</strong> -\r\n blessed with good looks, a great personality, and some other things \r\nthat can't be mentioned due to child innocence laws, Hailey is the more \r\nrelaxed of the group. She is thought to be born with a natural talent to\r\n kick anyone's butt and destroy a promised man's potential. She is a \r\nfull-blood Eraski, however she was born with a defect that caused her \r\nhair to become red instead of green. She became friends with Lance \r\nLagrand at the age of seven, when she moved next door to him in Xeatrra \r\nVillage and mistook him for a girl (much to Lance's surprise). Many say \r\nthat there is a romantic relationship going on between Lance and Hailey.\r\n Some say they're just friends, some say they're dating, and some say \r\nthey've gone further than that, but that's a story for a different game.\r\n She is highly against Max Rygiel's creepiness, and despite this, she \r\nremains friends with him solely because he's friends with Lance.<br/>\n<strong><br/>\r\nSiobhan Zaunbrecher</strong> - Emperor (henceforth 'King') of the\r\n Planet Ilyss, he witnessed his mother be killed by the military police \r\nand his sister be taken away as a young child. He was taken under King \r\nKraenu's wing as a disciple to learn from him and grow up to become a \r\npotential heir to his throne. He is said to be highly intelligent, as he\r\n spent most of his childhood reading about history, science, and just \r\nabout everything. He deliberately oppresses the people of Ilyss, even \r\nthough he does all the things that he hated as a child. He highly values\r\n his position as King  as it's the highest achievement he's had in his \r\nlife (besides his brief job as a puppet-maker), and will do anything to \r\nprotect it. Even if that means killing a couple of kids...<br/>\n<strong><br/>\r\nRaymonde Rockstad</strong> - Bodyguard of King Siobhan, Raymonde \r\nis very mysterious individual. Not much is know about him, except that \r\nhe is a veteran of the Ilyss Civil War of Year 873, which explains the \r\neye-patch that he wears. He is an excellent fighter, which explains why \r\nhe was able to escape a war prison with only a toothpick and booby pin.<br/>\n<strong><br/>\r\nMalie Mayle</strong> - Bodyguard of King Siobhan, not much is \r\nknown about Malie. She, like Siobhan, is highly intelligent and was once\r\n a spy for the Kraenu Military Logistics Association in Year 884. She is\r\n also an excellent fighter and was even the martial arts champion of her\r\n Class of Year 824 and once killed three men with one kick to the \r\ngonads.</p>The Setting<p><strong>Planet Ilyss</strong> -\r\n The Planet Ilyss is a serene but poverty stricken planet. Despite it's \r\neight continents, most are used for government property. One is even \r\ndevoted to King Siobhan's castle, which is surrounded by a huge poison \r\nswamp (also owned by the government). The planet has 15-hour days, with 7\r\n hours of daylight (to set up a good eight hour sleep schedule regulated\r\n and enforced by the government). Planet Ilyss has 10 moons, all owned \r\nby King Siobhan and one is devoted entirely to his idea of a one million\r\n square foot bouncy house. It also has a 133-day long year, which \r\nexplains Malie and Raymonde's older history yet aged appearence. It has \r\n3.42x earth gravity, meaning you weigh a lot more and it actually isn't \r\nbecause you're fat. Therefore, Planet Ilyss has a very low obesity \r\nweight (being obese is actually a felony and is punishable by execution \r\nby boiling). It is 3.9x the size of earth, allowing for a lot more \r\nwater, which is made up of salt and liquid metal that tastes like \r\nbubblegum but is illegal to consume by government law. Ilyss is in the \r\nCambrian period, along with a few more boring science facts. And is \r\nabout earth-distance from its sun, which is a big ball of gas and isn't \r\nvery hot but somehow keeps the planet warm due to it's closeness and \r\nhugging-ness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40ddd7709335067d28b8d0de1e6952af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedkixGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
