In this phase you can't shoot.</li><li><strong>Fighting Phase:</strong> Traverse the tunnels you made and shoot up your opponent (using X to shoot) before he does the same to you! In this phase you can't create new tunnels.<br/></li></ol><p>The only resource in this game is your Energy, denoted by the red bar above your tank. Once your Energy reaches zero, you die. You lose energy by digging or getting hit by a bullet, and you gain energy by being inside an ally's house.</p><p>Have fun playing!<br/></p><p><strong>Note: As of right now the servers are not online as I don't have a place to host them.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["irontissue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
