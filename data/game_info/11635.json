Both of you want to be the one to escape ruins with the artifact, but you don't necessarily have enough equipment to do it on your own. But by taking the artifact, a dark and ominous presence within the ruins has been awoken. Will both of you work together to try and solve the perilous puzzles that stand in your path? Or will you forsake each other to try and keep the treasure for yourselves? Or perhaps you will fall prey to that which lurks beneath the earth?
