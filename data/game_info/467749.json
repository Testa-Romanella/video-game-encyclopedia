Made in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2020, which had the theme of \"Out of Control\". If the resolution looks weird on the HTML5 version, please try downloading a version instead.<br/></p>\n<p>You are an arcade gamer trying to play a game on a broken arcade machine, and you can enlist the help of two gremlins who can complete the button circuits and allow you to play. Be careful though, because if they are forced to move too much, they'll get mad!<br/></p>\n<p>I used a lot of assets from itch and other places on the internet, since I have very little graphical talent.
