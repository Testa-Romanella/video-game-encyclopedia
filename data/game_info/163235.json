As the trapmaster you'll place traps around the map that'll fire at the escapee with a variety of behaviour. The escapee will seek out small green guys around the map, and win when they've collected ten of them.<br/>The game might not be entirely balanced, so i suggest playing a match, then switching places, and see who can get most points / get ten points fastest!</p>\n<p>This was a student project made by 4 inexperienced programmers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccdd1177f8967090acfb8b86987e1471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Cannonperson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
