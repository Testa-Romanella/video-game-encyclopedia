The objective is simple - try not to get frustrated. Although you will inevitably get frustrated.<br/><br/>Enjoy the optimistic look of your smiling blue cube while you can. You're going to need it as you guide the cube through a series of simple but increasingly challenging levels featuring precision platforming and puzzle solving gameplay. The further you get, the harder it becomes and the more frustrating your failure will be.<br/><br/>Later, after overcoming your inevitable frustration, you can replay your \"favourite\" levels in order to improve your best time, earn ranked medals based on your performance, and unlock new player skins. You can also compete with your friends on the in-game leaderboard to see who can complete each level the fastest.Main features<ul><li>Simple control scheme supporting both keyboards and controllers<br/></li><li>75 levels of increasing difficulty spread across 3 themed zones<br/></li><li>Medal system ranks you based on your performance and provides access to new zones and player skins<br/></li><li>Freely replay past levels to improve your time or medal<br/></li><li>Compete with your friends for the fastest time using the in-game leaderboard<br/></li><li>Original hand-drawn artwork designed to look good at HD/4K resolutions<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack with alternating music for each zone</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc3ec001fd25f7bde463e609973ebca8.jpg", "website": "https://www.ginever.net/projects/GIF/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ginever Entertainment"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ginever Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
