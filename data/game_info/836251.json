I changed the boss fight to level 3), sprinting by pressing shift, the usage of invisible wall, and elite enemies.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the second level is more complicated than the first and the third. Unlike the example modifications, it is still an outdoor environment, but with longer roads to travel. I utilized the enemies' function of calling another function on death. The player will have to eliminate all the enemies in one room\u00a0to get the key to the next room.</p>\n<p>Next, I added that the player will be able to sprint by pressing the shift key. It has a reload time\u00a0of three seconds. This really took me a lot of time because the information I found online is mainly about how to use input manager instead of input system package, but i still have it settled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lastly, I think the invisible wall and the elite enemies combined can be considered a major change. I discovered a problem while testing my game. If I continuously press space and w towards the mountains, I will eventually be able to scale over. Though the slope limit is 45, I will still be able to stand and jump on a slope steeper than 45 degrees. Thus, I placed invisible walls around the scene. The elite enemy cannot be considered a completely new class of enemy because I only change the size, color and health of the enemy.</p>\n<p>Created by Wentao Ma.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T13:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d1db0a5c8f563ee54f239449f5d0570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["GeniusBoy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
