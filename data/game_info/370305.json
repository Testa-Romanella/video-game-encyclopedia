Our innovative sex-tech supports over 45 adult sex toys that stay perfectly\u00a0in sync with what you see - allowing you\u00a0to feel the action as it happens. With our optional VR input, we track motion in our virtual park to provide fully immersive experiences - which will allow users to connect from anywhere in the world within the comfort of their own home once we launch the full platform after Early Access.  ViRo Club provides a safe and fun space where touch is encouraged, playfulness is required, and privacy is guaranteed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVirtual Romance Club currently works on Windows 10, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Valve Index.
