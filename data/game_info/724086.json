We started working on it as a side project and immediately fell in love with the concept and wanted to explore it more. So... We remade the whole game with new characters, stories, mechanics, and elements. We hope it has some impact in some way. This game is influenced by \"When The Darkness Comes\" (Obviously), \"Doki Doki Literature Club\", \"Omori\" and many more.<h3>CONTROLS</h3>Move with <strong>WASD</strong><br/>Toggle Sprint with <strong>LEFT SHIFT</strong><br/>Jump with <strong>SPACE</strong><br/>Interact with <strong>E</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43ebcfe9de5517c2528825b65762fe31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vasilis Louvris", "Giwrgos Kousakis"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Out of Body Experience"], "esrb_rating": null}
