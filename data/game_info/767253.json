I knew that I would not be able to work on computer all the time during the jam, so I made a game where I use lot of sounds. I recorded most of the audio on the first day, before I even knew what kind of game I was going to make.\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to experiment with how much you can make a game around just sounds and this is what I came up with: It is a game where you follow some sort of transmitters like breadcrumbs towards power supply and try to avoid something that lurks in the dark.\r\n</p>\n<p>As I was not going to be putting so much of the actual game play on the screen, I took this opportunity and tried to make clear and easy to read UI. Hope you like it and have fun.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6ef15d2feb41a0790d0600b7bf44423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miikka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
