This VR experience tries to illustrate how vast the scales are. You start at a human scale and enlarge yourself to a size of galaxies, or shrink to a scale of smallest particles.</p>\n<p>This project is fully inspired by Cary Huang's The Scale of the Universe web page. I saw this site a while ago and was quite mind blown. When I got VR set I was thinking of what would be a good app to make, that VR tech is kinda meant for. Meaning an app that really emphasizes on 3d space. After some thought I remembered about the scale of the universe site, tried to find it in VR but there wasn't one so I decided to create it.</p>\n<p>The project is quite incomplete, probably with some bugs, but the general experience is there. I tried to be as accurate as I could with represented information but there are probably some inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>Most of the 3d models are free models downloaded from sketchfab, planets and moons are from NASA, and what I couldn't find I modeled myself.</p>\n<p>author: Ivan Savi\u0107 ;\u00a0 \u00a0music by: Mladen Ivankovi\u0107</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b8/1b82286d81135a4ac6833c0cb7435b49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["ISavic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
