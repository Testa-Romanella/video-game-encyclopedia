{"id": 269656, "slug": "kendoku", "name": "Kendoku", "name_original": "Kendoku", "description": "Kendoku is a puzzle game, the rules are much similar like famous sudoku, but you need to care about more, or else you can't figure it out.<br/><br/>You have a square grid; each square may contain a digit from 1 to 9. The grid is divided into blocks of varying shape and size, with arithmetic clues written in them. <br/><br/>Your aim is to fully populate the grid with digits such that:<br/>1. Each row contains only one occurrence of each digit.<br/>2. Each column contains only one occurrence of each digit.<br/>3. The digits in each block can be combined to form the number stated in the clue, using the arithmetic operation given in the clue. That is:<br/>a. An addition clue means that the sum of the digits in the block must be the given number. For example, '15+'; means the contents of the block adds up to fifteen.<br/>b. A multiplication clue (e.g. '60x';), similarly, means that the product of the digits in the block must be the given number.<br/>c. A subtraction clue will always be written in a block of size two, and it means that one of the digits in the block is greater than the other by the given amount. For example, '2-'; means that one of the digits in the block is 2 more than the other, or equivalently that one digit minus the other one is 2. The two digits could be either way round, though.<br/>d. A division clue (e.g. '3\u00f7';), similarly, is always in a block of size two and means that one digit divided by the other is equal to the given amount.<br/><br/>Note that a block may contain the same digit more than once (provided the identical ones are not in the same row and column).<br/><br/>Game is designed by unlimited puzzles, you can custom your difficulty, and AI will generate a new board which has only one solution. Game support GameCenter which let you can beat all over world's players!
