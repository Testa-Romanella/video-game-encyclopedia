Fullscreen makes it really blurry though, so I don't recommend it. You can also use the arrow keys to move the shapes a little bit.</p>\n<p>Bonus: a html project I made in Unity where colourful balls fly into an abyss.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa57b1375e771a00b046ee50a7dd580a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Age"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
