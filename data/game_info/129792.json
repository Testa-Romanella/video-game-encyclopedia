{"id": 129792, "slug": "flat-2", "name": "Flat", "name_original": "Flat", "description": "<p>Flat is a short game made by Holly Hatter and me during the game jam\u00a0GAMERella in November 2015. The theme of the jam was \"Taking space /\u00a0Making space\".</p>\n<p>In this game, you must help inhabitants of a series of identical flats perform mundane actions. The problem is, the flats were made to be conform to the \"average people\", and these people are not average - who really is, in fact ? You'll have to find a way to adapt their surroundings to them, so they can do the most basic things.</p>\n<p>As this game was made during two days (and some extra hours to have something \"finished\"), it's nowhere near perfect. I wrote a note full of small tips and things you should know, so don't hesitate to read it before playing.</p>\n<p>Have a nice play !</p>\n<p>===</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the game and can afford it, please consider donating : this game is free but your help would be very appreciated for us to continue making things in the future :)<br/></p>\n<p>===</p>\n<p>If you want to follow my future things, you can follow me on Twitter :\u00a0@HeskHwis<br/></p>\n<p>Holly Hatter made all the art and we co-designed the game.
