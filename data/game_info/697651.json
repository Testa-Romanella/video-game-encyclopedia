I have decided to participate into the Game Jam Parade 2021 for the second time on my own. This time I\u00a0feel (although I\u00a0was late with my submission a few minutes) it went a lot better than last time.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Having finished my first year of game development certainly helped as I\u00a0was able to complete most of the code myself without having to follow tutorials or seek advice from lecturers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>[In every game jam I\u00a0try and learn new things and push myself to get better at a multitude of game development skills these are the things that I\u00a0feel I\u00a0masted better from this game jam:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Isometric tile maps (I had never used them before and It took me all the way up to Thursday or Friday to master them and be able to complete some levels that I\u00a0was happy with) I am quite happy with how to use them as well as create assets for these tile sets. Though I\u00a0got to be honest I\u00a0didn't have enough time to spend on assets considering that it took me so long to master them. I\u00a0decided to add some screenshots I\u00a0took of my original map building just to show my learning path.</p>\n<p>- Animations: Animations is something that I kind of struggled in the past and never quite understood them, but I\u00a0can say after animating a few of my characters I am much happier now and much more comfortable with using Spriter.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- C# and problem solving I had a lot of issues from spawning items, inventory management, and problem solving was a major reason why I\u00a0was even able to produce a game by the end of this game jam. I\u00a0feel I have improved majorly also in my coding capabilities though I\u00a0still have a lot to learn.\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Art in Asesprite: I came a long way from my first participating of my first game jam I\u00a0can remember the backgrounds that I made back than so seeing my art today makes me happy to see how much I have come from where I\u00a0was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>]\r\n  </p>\n<p>Over the next few days, I intend to add a few more polished things such as images for menu, UI polishes and functionality and a bit more fun in escaping the prison. I tried hard to have all the functionality there but in all off that I\u00a0kind of left out the fun of interactions so I will try my best to add what I\u00a0can in the next 3 days.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em><strong>Thank you for choosing to play my little game.</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Silv.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cdeaf0c8ca0ace27eb5440e8144ca90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noel Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
