Neon Aileron was created to evoke memories of playing older shooters that pre-date the bullet-hell genre.  We call this bullet-lite, because the focus is on shooting enemies instead of dodging complex bullet patterns.  We designed this game for fans of U.N. Squadron, Gradius, and Thunder Force.Features<ul><li>Bullet-Lite Shoot 'Em Up - Spend more time shooting, less time dodging.<br/></li><li>Synchronized Soundtrack - This game features a custom synth soundtrack by Von Hertzog.
