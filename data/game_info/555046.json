It is based on a team project we developed in pygame during Sophomore year. <br/></p>\n<p>Play against your friends in randomly generated dungeons, powering up your character until the clock hits 0, then fight it out in a free for all arena against one another! <br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know if you like it and how it runs on your PC. If you have suggestions or bug reports I may be able to implement them in an updated release. I hope to develop more games in the future so your input means alot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b782acb16affb967e5c69293e8e8713b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GallagherB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
