The concept of the project was to learn to place and move pre-existing assets in order to build our own platforming game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My whole design process for this project was a little backward since I\u00a0really had no idea of a story for this game. I really just found these assets right before I was supposed to present my project in class and threw them in. So when it came to building the level I had no plan of where I wanted to go or how long I wanted the level to be. So I threw together a small sketch in my art notebook and just started placing assets into the level to get a feeling for space. A few hours later we ended up with this little level that I'm kinda happy with.</p>\n<p>I didn't implement a death screen or a lives system because it is of course just a test build but I did add in a level reset system connected to the spikes.</p>\n<p>The two assets I used for my project are listed below if you like how they look inside my level you should check out the original artists' itch.io pages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Medieval Pixel Art by BlackSpire</p>\n<p>https://blackspirestudio.itch.io/medieval-pixel-art-asset-free</p>\n<p>Hero Knight by Sven</p>\n<p>https://sventhole.itch.io/hero-knight<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/962/9623b4532acbc9a018b8b46976cc6055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ephiemus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
