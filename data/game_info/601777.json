It is by no means my full project.\u00a0This demo version has only 2 enemy types and one\u00a0boss at the end.\u00a0You can expect many more maps, more enemy variety each with their own behaviour, locations, equipments, guns, and even whole systems as development progresses.</p>\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys\u00a0for movement.</p>\n<p>Mouse for aiming and shooting.</p>\n<p>R for reloading.</p>\n<p>Spacebar for jumping (requires you to have the special boots)</p>\n<p>Q quicksaves at any time. Only your current level, health and score are saved. Ammo and equipment must be found throughout each level. You can load this quicksave through the corresponding menu option.<br/></p>\n<p>P or Esc keys for Pause menu.</p>\n<p>Enter confirms options in the menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may notice that the shots don't always go exactly towards\u00a0where your mouse is pointing. This is intended, as future updates will add\u00a0ways for the player to improve their stats in\u00a0accuracy system, as well as other RPGesque elements.</p>\n<p>This is version 0.1. Updates on a weekly basis. If you like the game, consider donating. All funds received go towards the development, improvement and bugfixes.\u00a0Every bit helps. I'm also open to feedback, tell me what you think about the game.\u00a0Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56e3ef32cf5ed422eedcebf70b106da0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wild Yoshi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
