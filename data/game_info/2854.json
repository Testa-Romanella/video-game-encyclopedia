I\u2019ve played a ton of platformers on iOS during my time here at AppAdvice, but Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire is one of the better ones I\u2019ve found. The game is absolutely gorgeous with dreamy landscapes and endearing character models, plus the music and sounds are fun to listen to. The controls work well enough, and the game is fairly challenging, even for seasoned platformer veterans. Le Parker: Sous Chef Extraordinaire is definitely one of the better games I\u2019ve picked up on iOS this year.&amp;quot;<br/>\u2022\u20229.0\u2022\u2022 review at App Advice<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>\u2022 Simple, super responsive touch control and in-air jumps for accurate and truly challenging platforming.
