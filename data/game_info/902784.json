While I didn't get to do more things with the game due to the time constraint and my sleep schedule, I think what's in it is probably pretty good even though it doesn't contain sounds or better ui or better art or blablabla (you get the idea).</p>\n<p>Because this is a part of Mini Jam 122, the theme of Intermission is there, it's just (I think) not particularly clever or anything, but I couldn't come up with a better idea that I can get a game going on.<br/></p>\n<p>The restriction theme is there too, as abandoning or failing to reach the goal planet leads to gaining funds to upgrade your rocket.</p>\n<p>I do also encourage any suggestions and criticism on it!</p>\n<p>(I also forgot a bit of the controls in the game... so uhhh it's in the description for the complete set.)</p>\n<p>(Also updated page for added screenshots and description text.)<br/></p>\n<p>The source code: https://codeberg.org/T4rmin/underfunded-rocketry.git<br/>VCR OSD Mono (The font used in the game): https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T12:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8791a7de5f4548459ecbfc8fa01fe83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["T4rmin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
