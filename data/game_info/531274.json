{"id": 531274, "slug": "highway-encounter-itch", "name": "Highway Encounter (itch)", "name_original": "Highway Encounter (itch)", "description": "<p>A remake of one of my absolute favourite ZX Spectrum games.</p>\n<p>Highway Encounter is a strategy/action game played in a 3D isometric perspective.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You must successfully chaperone a bomb along a long stretch of highway to the\u00a0 \u00a0alien base at the end. There are 30 screens to pass through filled with hazards that\u00a0 \u00a0threaten to block your progress. Players control a robotic \"Vorton\" and one of the\u00a0 \u00a0things that provides Highway Encounter with its unique appeal is that the bomb is\u00a0 \u00a0constantly being pushed onwards by your extra lives - four more Vortons\u00a0 \u00a0accompanying you along the highway. A key strategic element to the game is for\u00a0 \u00a0the player vorton to travel several screens ahead of the bomb to clear a safe path.\u00a0 \u00a0This can be done by temporarily blocking the bomb's forward motion, However, if\u00a0 \u00a0the bomb is left unguarded it is possible for all your extra lives to be lost without\u00a0 \u00a0the main vorton being destroyed once. When all spare lives are lost, the main\u00a0 \u00a0vorton must manually push the bomb.</p>\n<p>The Spectrum version was voted no.40 in the Your Sinclair official top 100 games of all time, though in my opinion should have ranked a lot higher. A sequel, Alien Highway, was released in 1986 but for me it didn't have the same magic as the original.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b0746c876fbbf227e555b653684cb1fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Langford Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
