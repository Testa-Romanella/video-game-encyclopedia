Through this charitable act, she taught me much about taking care of animals, and our team translated this wisdom into a pet care simulator. The simulator takes place over a week of in-game time, ending with the player\u2019s giving up their fosters for adoption; this reflects the bittersweet nature of actual fostering, as you have to say goodbye to the kittens you bonded with for (usually) about three months. Our hope is that when people play this game, they will experience a chill, day-to-day experience that represents the reality of living alongside fosters. \u2013 Zayden Joyner, an artist on <em>Home for Now</em><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Quin Cheek - Lead Programmer/Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://japzer.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Jason Shull - Programmer/Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://strongdark.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Mitchell Young - Programmer/Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://spygie.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Thomas Revord - Programmer/Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://thomasrevord.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Aiden Vandeberg - Programmer/Game Designer</p>\n<p>https://incircles.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Jermaine Logan - Producer/Sound Designer</p>\n<p>https://guyoy1.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Stormy Rappaport - Lead Artist</p>\n<p>https://skoger.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Zayden Joyner - Artist</p>\n<p>https://zephurr.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Hazel the Cat - Cuteness\u00a0</p>\n<p>cutie lil fluff<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T20:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b52/b52189246e44a16fd015ffa0118ea6a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["guyoy1", "StrongDarkrai", "Japzer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
