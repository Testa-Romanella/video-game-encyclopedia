I was sad to see that the game didn't live up to my expectations, so I decided to try my hand at creating my own version.\r\n</p>\n<p>While my coding skills\u00a0 for these types of sandbox games\u00a0are still in the early stages of development, I have done my best to incorporate the features I had hoped for and create a unique gaming experience. I recognize that there may be some limitations and imperfections, but I hope you will still find enjoyment in playing the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to share my creation with you, and I would be honored if you could provide me with your feedback. Whether it be positive or constructive, I am eager to hear your thoughts and use them to improve my skills and make future iterations of the game even better.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to play my game, and I hope you have a fun and enjoyable experience. Your support means the world to me.\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>- CLICK AND DRAG TILE TO MOVE</p>\n<p>- CLICK TWO SOLDIERS OF THE SAME LEVEL TO <strong>MERGE</strong> TO A HIGHER LEVEL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f206f7c7c44cb8e1e97208f104701291.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BoxDudeStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
