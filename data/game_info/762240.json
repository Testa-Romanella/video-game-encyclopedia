In this game your goal is to try to Die of Old Age (as the title suggests (hopefully)). You move around with WASD and jump with SPACE. You can also jump down if you press SPACE and S at the same time. Oh, and also use SPACE to advance the dialogue.<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you can't beat the final level then you need to git gud.</p>\n\n<p>The full game and all of the assets (except for teh font, that's just the default font in LibGDX) was made by me in a very short amount of time ((Less that 48 hours) including a fairly large amount of procrastination). I'm now tired of making the game, so I shall\u00a0publish it and move on with my life instead of polishing it (in case you were wondering why the game is so unpolished).<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made using LibGDX. I used ProCreate to draw stuff. I used Logic Pro X to make the music and record the voice acting. You can listen to the soundtrack on my SoundCloud: INSERT LINK HERE. (Okay soundcloud appears to be having some issues, so I guess I'll post it later)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T14:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96e/96e3b28826396a4708cdef947395f047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DennisMagnusson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
