Try not to fight unless you have a hard time avoiding an enemy</p>\n<p>2. Don't be afraid to utilize the smoke bombs</p>\n<p>3. If you're all out of resources, you can generally still bait enemies or get them to run in circles</p>\n<p>4. You don't need to be able to beat the final battle to get either endings. Leveling up is a nice to have that makes combat easier. But there are still only so many times you can restore your mana.</p>\n<p>5. Since resources are very limited, it's expected to have to restart and try again with a more efficient strategy once you are more familiar with the map.</p>\n<p>FYI the game design is heavily influenced by earlier Resident Evil games, hence the rationing resources (including your own mana, and when to fight/run)</p>\r\nGeneral\r\n<p>Once the Harold Jam ratings are over, I will simply update the original page and get rid of this one.</p>\n<p>Bug Fixes in this version</p>\n<p>- Too easy to walk into defeated ghost, made it possible to walk through them</p>\n<p>- Fixed default choice for switches in dungeon</p>\n<p>- Added bag of ice, forgot this item in original jam submission</p>\n<p>- Fixed a piece of lore being unreadable</p>\n<p>Known Bugs</p>\n<p>- Defeated/ghosts fled from can still be fought if pressing confirm when facing them</p>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>Thanks to the feedback I'm getting, appreciate anyone who takes the time to play and comment on my game!</p>\n<p>- Instant respawn when out of resources, mana, and health</p>\n<p>- Easy mode (maybe only if I have more content in general)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:23:10", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gloriousclover"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
