Due to this crazy idea from SVD comercial department we opted for Swipe in a Tindergram fashion. That was made\u00a0in order\u00a0to control the camera/movement.</p>\n<p>On the first week\u00a0it was stated that the game had\u00a0to bring forward\u00a0an Y2K aesthetic and just one stage, but later on, comercial department decided to add 5 different worlds/stages with the\u00a0japanese culture reflected upon, plus it had to contain a collectable mechanic with\u00a0Y2K inspired objects (\"inspired\", so they don't infringe\u00a0copyright law).</p>\n<p>Due to the extension of the game and the expected playability on limited capacity software devices,\u00a0almost every 3D object\u00a0was kept at a lowpoly definition and just used difuse texture alongside a few ones with transparency.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>All the game was conceived using Playcanvas, 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop and Renoise.</p>\n<p>Art, animation and music on the game was made by Pau Magran\u00e9 except a few meshes in the scenario 2 and 5 that have been bought here and there.<br/></p>\n<p>Programming was made by Leonidas Maliokas and controls were made by Steven Yau.</p>\n<p>Gigantic thank you to Daniel Levy for the trust (missed working hand to hand)\u00a0and\u00a0Ariadna Parreu + Cristian Herrera for the help configuring the showcase at the shop.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>A real experience of individual crunch time :_)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>Note that a\u00a0few promotional textures have been excluded from the original game due to itch.io html5 game files limit (1000).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T06:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/46876ca02597b950925008e081cb7411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pau Magran\u00e9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
