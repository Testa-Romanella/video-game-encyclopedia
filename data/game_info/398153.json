So, the meaning of this game is to complete a mission. If you're apart of a small or large group will determine what mission you complete. You can either find out what group is an\u00a0\"other\" or who the leader is. You'll go through various encounters of other passengers, figuring out who is who. Although, this the main goal, you'll have other little adventures. But, we are focusing on who you are talking to, and your decision on who you think is apart of them. I give you little hints in the beginning on what to look for when speaking to them. Once you believe you know who is an \"other\" and/or the leader, then you make the choice of sending them to Earth, but there's a twist. So, play the game to figure out how it really ends. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:38:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/56384d6ac37ce661249775d211e62342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["klipham76"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
