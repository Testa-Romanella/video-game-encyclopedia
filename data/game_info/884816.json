Madoka went on to explain that Sayuka acquired the necessary energy to transform into Escalayer and drive away Dai-Lust only by experiencing sexual arousal.<br/>\n\"I'm begging you, please make my heart beat fast!\" said Sayuka to Kyouhei... and so their days of sex and war began.<br/>\nTheir goal? The total defeat of Dai-Lust!<br/>\n \nCharacters\n\n<ul>\n<li>Escalayer</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nThe superhero tasked with fighting Dai-Lust and its monster army.<br/>\nA power-generation device known as the Dynamic ba-Dump Dynamo (DDD for short) throbs within her body, allowing her to generate fearsome amounts of energy through increased sexual arousal.<br/>\nShe'll get raped if she loses in battle, but that will ultimately prove to her benefit, as the DDD will generate energy regardless of how voluntary her arousal is.<br/>\nHer ultimate technique is the \"Sublimit Escalation\", wherein her ribbon blade tears her foes asunder.\n<ul>\n<li>Sayuka Kouenji</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nThe girl who transforms into Escalayer. A glasses-clad girl with a mostly-submissive personality, her consciousness has been transferred into a militarized bio-body.<br/>\nShe's quite curvy, but Sayuka herself is only concerned about her butt being too big.<br/>\nDue to how essential the D2 energy her heart generates is for battle, she will never refuse any of Kyouhei's requests, no matter how perverted the things he demands of her may be.\n<ul>\n<li>Kyouhei Yanase</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nThis game's protagonist.<br/>\nHe decided to help protect the Earth after Madoka blackmailed him into doing so.<br/>\nA slightly twisted sort of person, it doesn't take much urging to push him down a rather dark path...\n<ul>\n<li>Madoka Kouenji</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nEscalayer's support android.<br/>\nShe's blunt and (at times) inconsiderate, which can cause problems for Sayuka and Kyouhei.<br/>\nHer programming is not based on the three laws of robotics, so she will do literally whatever it takes to destroy Dai-Lust.\n<ul>\n<li>Ryouko Kiritani</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nA widow who recently moved into the house next to Sayuka's.<br/>\nShe's kind to Kyouhei and Sayuka, her neighbors, and freely gives them advice whenever they come to her for help.\n<ul>\n<li>Gentarou Kouenji</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nSayuka's father and the genius mind behind the creation of Escalayer, the Dynamic ba-Dump Dynamo, and Madoka.<br/>\nHe is currently imprisoned within Dai-Lust's base, along with many other scientists from Earth.\n<br/><br/>\n<p>This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:13:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af0944f30bc2d0d445ecf844baaf9b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alicesoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
