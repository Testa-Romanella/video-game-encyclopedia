If you come across any bugs, please do not hesitate to report them in the comments section or by contacting me personally. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me to refine and improve the game for future releases. Thank you for your cooperation and enjoy your noble journey!<br/><br/><strong>Additionaly,<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I acknowledge that there are some localization issues in the current version of Untold Sagas, resulting in unnatural-sounding dialogues and sentences. This is due to my reliance on third-party services for quick translation during the limited development time for NaNoRenO 2023. Rest assured, i am actively working to manually refine and polish the text to provide a fully immersive experience. Please stay tuned for updates and improvements in the coming days. Thank you for your understanding and support!<br/><br/>P.S<br/>For those interested in exploring the code or artwork of Untold Sagas, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to download the Unity package.
