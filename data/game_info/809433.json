This side project took me nearly a month. It's still pretty buggy and there is some stuff I got no idea how to resolve but I ran out of time. The sound and music selection aren't the best and some animation isn't what I have envision. I was unable to script it. Overall I'm still proud of it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing &lt;3</p>\n<p>Check out my art:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/mehfruitsart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T08:40:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97aec336f4c75b2dafed131f4a40d2de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MehFruits"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
