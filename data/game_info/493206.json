We heard about Alice and the rabbit hole from cartoons, books, and movies, so most people are familiar with them. In addition, there are metaphors related to Alice found in many modern stories. We believe in combing Carroll's works in mathematics and logic with stories from Alice in Wonderland. This experience will be both entertaining and educational.</p>\n<p>Lewis Carroll invented a tool - the Carroll Diagram (1886) - to visualize the attributes of things which we re-created in Carroll\u2019s Riddles. Aided with this interactive Carroll Diagram, you can only make your way out of the tree hole by tackling the logic riddles. We suppose this interactive and guided approach can accelerate your mastery of logic.</p>\n<p>This immersive journey is unlike any other, pushing the limits of the viewer\u2019s imagination and challenging them to make sense of a nonsensical world. Will you be able to master Carroll Diagram in this VR wonderland?</p>\n<p>Carroll's Riddles VR app is created with Unreal Engine 4.24.
