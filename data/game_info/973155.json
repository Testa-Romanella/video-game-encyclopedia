The government decided to send a military research team to investigate but instead of getting to the core, they found another world hiding in the dark. The cave was strangely big and it had its own sky and a lake of blood that was burning your skin. The event was unusual and after they decided to navigate on the lake, they found a mysterious cabin at the other side of the shore, like someone was actually living there. Everything was so bizarre that the government decided to build a military base to study that strange occurence. Within 66 days, all the people involved in the project disappeared along with that cave except one. Dr. John Ellis was outside the cave at that time trying to reach the research team but he couldn\u2019t find the entrance anymore. Following the disappearance he found that the black mountains represents the point where other worlds collide. Also, the locals of the West Village located at the base of the mountains told Dr. John Ellis that the cave found inside the Black Mountains is a gate of hell. Even if you escape from that cave your soul will be taken sooner or later. According to the legend, it appears once every 66 years for 66 days and everyone that gets trapped in, is not getting back. After several days, the doctor died in strange circumstances and nobody went to that cave again for 66 years.<br/>IN THE PRESENT, as tourists in the West Village, you and your friends found about the legend of the gate of hell.
