You''re on a spaceship. <strong>2 guns</strong>. One for people, one for zombies. <strong>2 worlds</strong> - parallel realities, positive and negative, one with soldiers and one with zombies. Watch out! You are in both of them in the same time but you can see just one at a time. You have a magic ring to enter the second reality. The goal is to walk through the level (we are the only one who knows where the end is!!! buhahaha) and wait until the time goes to 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Made for Warsaw Film School Game Jam IV , theme was 'negative'.
