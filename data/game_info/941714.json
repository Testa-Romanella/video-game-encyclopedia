You'll be using your trusty laser gun to shoot strawberries with precision, as they float through the air. These strawberries are no ordinary fruit, however, as they are armed with powerful weapons and are determined to take you down. As you blast your way through each level, you'll need to keep your eyes open and be ready to fire quickly to avoid getting hit yourself. The strawberries will come at you from all angles, so you'll need to be constantly moving and dodging their attacks. You'll also need to be careful not to accidentally shoot any other objects in the level, as that will cost you valuable points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f7327e0aab900162fa49a2bf067a3956.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Multilink Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
