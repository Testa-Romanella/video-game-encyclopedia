The difference in this version is that you have to match every successive pair in one attempt. To make this goal not impossible the player is allowed to look at all the cards on the board before making an attempt. The catch is that there is a time limit. Once that timer runs out, all the cards will flip back face-down and two cards will switch places with each other at random. </p><p>Instructions:</p><p>Left click to flip a card over. When you are ready to make an attempt, click the solve button and begin matching the pairs. </p><p>* I'm looking for feedback! If you encounter a bug or have any suggestions please leave a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ae/8aeb31b8c049938c9740934523dcb36e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jackson Bowman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
