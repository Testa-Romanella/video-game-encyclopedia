This shotgun material can't be destroyed by any force. But this gun requires ammo to function. Now Connor is on a battle mission to destroy all the space terminators and restore peace for eternity.\u00a0 When he came out of the ship, he said his favorite dialog of his grandfather friend, which is \"I am Ammo\".</strong></p>\n<p>You are a shotgun with a mission to destroy many space terminators as possible.\u00a0 \u00a0 Collect ammo as you go,\u00a0 out of ammo means you are out of the game. Destroying the space terminator also earns you more ammo than collecting ammo scattered in the space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The more you have ammo, the higher will be the precaution taken by the space terminators.
