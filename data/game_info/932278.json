I am a very irresponsible person...<br/></p>\n\n<p>The walls are auto generated (but not perfectly. It might happen that 2 walls overlap or the starting tile where the player stands becomes a wall, which isn't optimal).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The movement of the player still really needs some work. But it shouldn't be a problem to navigate around the maze.</p>\n<p>The bombs boom and chain together, so you can blow up several walls in one go.</p>\n<p>Upgrades are there (only <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>bomb</strong>, <strong>speed</strong>, and <strong>pierce bombs\u00a0</strong>for now).</p>\n\n<p>You can reload the page anytime to get a newly generated maze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's still a WIP, or not. Depends if I find the time and motivation to keep working on it I guess. I think the bomberman gameplay has never really been utilized. At least I can't think of another game like it. I would like to see if there is a way to make it it's own game and not just a bomberman clone.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T15:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c6465da218af5023a1c8288add4c0216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SPhliyner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
