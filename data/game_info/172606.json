Do you know where your children are? </em></p>\n<p><em>Survive a night in Piedmont High, where strange things are said to be happening. Tortured souls wander the halls, fleshy mounds form in the cracks, and students are suddenly going missing... </em><br/></p>\n<p><em>A Night in Piedmont High</em> is a test to see if I can replicate both the tension and charm of classic survival horror games like <em>Silent Hill</em> and <em>Alone in The Dark</em>.</p>\n<p>This is my first demo release, including 6 small rooms in one area of the school. Many things are placeholders now, but I'd love for you to give it a shot and let   me know what you think.</p>\n\n<p>Controls (controller recommended):</p>\n<p>WASD, Arrow Keys, left stick or d-pad - Move</p>\n<p>Shift, B Button - Run</p>\n<p>Ctrl, RB - Aim</p>\n<p>Space, A Button - Interact (shoot when aimed)</p>\n<p>Alt, R, X button - Reload</p>\n<p>?, Q, Y Button - Heal</p>\n<p>Tab, Start - HUD/Map</p>\n<p>Esc, Select - Quit (when HUD is up)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdd11abec8b022d59671ea2d4cf0f0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Braindeer Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
