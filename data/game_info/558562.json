You've decided that it's your responsibility to stop them once again, armed with just your lightning-fast metabolism, and a fully-loaded gift card from the taco place! And this time, you can bring a friend along for two-player simultaneous play! That's right, the size of the poop-parazzi has doubled!<br/><br/>Once again, small poops will only slow the joggers down. But keep pooping, and your poops will grow to massive size! Giant poops stop the joggers for good and score you points! When your chamber is empty, fill up at the taco place! And don't let too many joggers get away, or it's Game Over!<br/><br/>Pixel Poops Number Two features fast action that only gets faster, a multitude of different environments and 40 challenging levels, gorgeous pixel art graphics and animation, and music and sound effects from CosmicGem and Shiru8Bit!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>DPAD - Movement</p>\n<p>A button - Poop / Eat</p>\n<p>Start - Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Poop</strong>\u00a0- small poops will stun the joggers, but only the largest will trap them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bridges -\u00a0</strong>Bridges are meant for walking, and unfortunately, not pooping.</p>\n<p><strong>The HUD</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Misses -\u00a0</strong>Each enemy that gets away counts as a miss.
