I thought of the state-switching mechanic first, then based the rest of the game around the characteristics each would provide. While I did not have the time to implement every idea that I had thought of in class, I wouldn't mind expanding the core mechanic out into a real product in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this prototype is where I learned about many of the design patterns I use in other projects, such as Disasteroids. These design patterns include the state, observer, object pooling, and singleton patterns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T19:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2680d4fa8936e02f02b49eb80779e8d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BWOlah2000"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
