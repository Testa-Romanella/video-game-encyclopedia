It was the second basketball arcade game by Konami, following Super Basketball. Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks, as well as The Star-Spangled Banner theme during attract mode, which was the first arcade game to feature the national anthem. These were uncommon in video games at the time of Double Dribble's release. While successful in the arcades, the game became and remained popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987.</p>\n<p>Double Dribble was followed by a sequel titled Double Dribble: The Playoff Edition, which was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. A remake titled Double Dribble Fastbreak was released for iOS in 2010, being based mostly on the NES version; however, the animation sequences were ripped from the arcade version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5979530a566117b175019c6d1e9f2e1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "Wii", "Game Boy", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
