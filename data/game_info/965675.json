At first you will die often and you will die a lot, but that's OK. Slowly you will learn the basics. Once you get them, you will be amazed how fast and easy your fingers tackle the challenges. Don't give up and have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou control two heroes - a white frog and a black frog. They work as a team. The white frog hops on white tiles and the black frog hops on black tiles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSometimes one frog has to carry the other, because there are no matching tiles. Other times one frog has to unblock the tiles of the other, so both can continue forward.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTeleports are tricky. The frogs may have to hop on each other's backs before and after entering the teleport in order to match the right tiles on the entrance and exit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, you have to move fast. A predator chases the frogs and tries to catch them. Sometimes you can deceive it and use it to unblock your way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T04:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28aa3f398053667c599bcc854176ee14.jpg", "website": "https://nosixfive.com/votsr/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["No Six Five"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["No Six Five"], "esrb_rating": null}
