{"id": 445614, "slug": "orbital-itch-blastinghavoc", "name": "Orbital (itch) (Blastinghavoc)", "name_original": "Orbital (itch) (Blastinghavoc)", "description": "<p>Welcome to Orbital!\u00a0Orbital is a retro Tower Defence / Arcade Shooter hybrid, in which you fight to defend your home planet from waves of invaders. You control a powerful planetary cannon capable of defending the planet from any angle, which is good because the enemies are all around you! Over the course of several waves you earn money which you can spend on improving your main cannon, or on \"towers\" to do some of the fighting for you (which can also be upgraded).</p>\n<p>Reach the final wave to save humanity, or perish by alien hands! Not to worry though, you can always try again! The numerous different upgrades for each of the towers support several different play-styles, and a fair bit of replayability.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left click -&gt; shoot and place towers</p>\n<p>Right click -&gt; cancel placement of tower</p>\n<p>Tab -&gt; toggle pause menu</p>\n<p>Click on towers or the main cannon in between waves to select them for upgrading. Upgrades apply to just that specific tower (e.g upgrading one gun tower does not upgrade the others). Some of the most interesting upgrades are \"specialisations\" which are mutually exclusive (e.g the main cannon cannot be both a shotgun and a sniper).</p>\n<p>Upgrades and towers sell for the same price you bought them for, so you can experiment with different setups without fear of losing money.</p>\n<p>Enemies damage the planet when they reach it, proportional to their remaining health, so letting a few small enemies through is less of an issue than a single big one.</p>\r\nStatus of development\r\n<p>There is much more planned for Orbital, but development is on a ~4 month hiatus due to another project with higher priority. I do intend to continue with Orbital afterwards,\u00a0here's a list of some of the planned features:</p>\n<ul><li>Multi-planet campaign</li><li>More enemy types and movement patterns</li><li>More towers and upgrades (including Flamethrower and Electric)</li><li>Graphics and Audio improvements for special effects, more distinctive projectiles etc</li><li>Save/load capabilities</li></ul>\r\nFeedback &amp; known issues\r\n<p>Orbital is the first game I've ever released, and I welcome any and all feedback about how to improve it! That being said, there are some issues that I am already aware of, and\u00a0will be addressed when work resumes:</p>\n<ul><li>You can currently place missile towers on top of each other, which can make it impossible to access the upgrades list of the one(s) underneath (there's plenty of space, so just... don't do that). You can always sell them to put them elsewhere if necessary.</li><li>It can be inconvenient to select gun towers under the main cannon (but it should always be possible)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/380/38020a1b8d69a100e5b3600014a8d4a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blastinghavoc"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
