Both of our games strive to do this in different ways.</p>\n<p><em>Third Born</em> creates an almost unsettling introspection. If players come away with a new perspective on morality, how others view the world, or the costs of leadership, we\u2019ve done our job.</p>\n<p>Our first game, <em>Elemental Assassin</em>, lets players experience a magical power fantasy through its VR earth-bending system. The mechanics, inspired by <em>Avatar the Last Airbender</em>, let players manipulate the earth itself. It is a short fast-paced action infiltration game available here for free!</p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter for updates and announcements!</p>\n\n<p><em>Does being forced to make horrible sacrifices mean you\u2019re evil?</em>\n</p>\n\r\nContributors:\r\n<p>Johnny Delgado - Game Design, Writing, Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Sherry D. - Visual Art<br/></p>\n<p>QA Testing and Editing<br/>Gamaliel De La Torre<br/>Jimmy D.<br/>Sofia Delgado<br/>Christopher D.<br/>Kelly D.<br/>Benjamin Edelman<br/>Alex Frank<br/>Emerson H.<br/>Izabelle M.<br/>Keith Peer<br/>Alika Williams</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/aca694864e482fe23db1ce28e0392964.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Platform19"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
