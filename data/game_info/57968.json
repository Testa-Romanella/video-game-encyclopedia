Although both versions possess the same missions and content, the PlayStation version is a tactical vehicle-shooting game while the PC version is a real-time strategy game (similar to Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds). The game is loosely based on the movie WarGames; one of the story consultants was John Badham, director of the original film.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-19T14:32:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63d702ad7f5b634fd7b6e48bcb3afa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Blitz Games", "Interactive Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "MGM Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
