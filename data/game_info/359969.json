{"id": 359969, "slug": "rgb-pribeiro84", "name": "RGB (pribeiro84)", "name_original": "RGB (pribeiro84)", "description": "<p>This simple platforming game is based on the idea of having just a single color palette active at one time. By pressing \"e\", players can cycle through the red, green, and blue color layers revealing different tools and hazards in the player's way. Some tools can only be interacted with on their own color layer. On the other hand, hazards are invisible on other color layers but will still hurt the player. Additionally, the game design concept would have a single additional power for the red, blue, and green characters besides normally walking and jumping. The green character can climb, the blue character would be able to perform a dash attack, and the red character would be able to double jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c676a833438b92c5ad21f4600bdcfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pribeiro84"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
