Once the meter is full the dog will try to rip the rope from you, if you let go at the right time (Release Mouse Click) the dog will fly up and back into the air. Right before the dog lands, grab back onto the rope.</p>\n<p>Over time the guiding box will disappear. If you have batteries you can bring it back to help guide your hands, otherwise watch the dogs movements and tug accordingly.</p>\n<p>Originally built for mobile devices, you can play it here in your browser or download it for windows. The HTML version isn't the best quality-wise, sorry about that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d769a391c0dc1ec23eb61198223c0c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Scottie Supple"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
