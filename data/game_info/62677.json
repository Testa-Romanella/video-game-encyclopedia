(Fish Are Nasty, Cake Is Excellent Vektor Evading Emblazed Rapture)", "name_original": "FAN'CIE VEER! (Fish Are Nasty, Cake Is Excellent Vektor Evading Emblazed Rapture)", "description": "Anything is possible in virtual worlds, but even spaceships have common knowledge known to most people back here on Earth.. that \"Fish are Nasty\", and Cake is Most Excellent!\" (Well, perhaps not most people, but ask any of the smarter, wiser younger children and they will surely tell you the truths about fish and cake)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this fast action game of quick reflexes and decision making, you'll need to steer your multi-colored ship clear of all rocks and fish that will take your life!  You can destroy the rocks by changing your ship to the opposite color of the rock and blasting it into shattered fragments.  And while the fish will spawn and home on on you, you can destroy them by making sure your ship is the same color as the fish before shooting them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCake is certainly delicious, and eating a slice of this randomly spawning delight will score you huge points, but also make your ship fatter and slower each piece you engulf!  Eat too much cake and your movement speed will slow to a snails pace making dodging rocks and incoming fish very difficult.  However, you can work the cake off and lower your size by simply moving around.  The more you move around, the lighter and slimmer your spaceship will become, allowing you more maneuverability and movement speed!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nClearing a screen of all rocks and fish will advance you to the next level where the threats will increase in both number and speed, but the point rewards will also grow as well!  Score as many points as you can before you run out of lives!  How long can you last and what high score can you obtain in \"FAN'CIE VEER\"?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28faf5effc67a7c37de3092ca2c70e98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZaxtorGameS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["ZaxtorGameS"], "esrb_rating": null}
