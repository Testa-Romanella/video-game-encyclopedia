Holding right click paints a continuous stream of objects while single left click spawns one object at a time. The colors (Red, Green, and Blue) can be adjusted in the bottom left corner via sliders. The drop-down menu can be used to choose between a capsule, cube, or sphere. There is an 'Erase All' feature as well as an option to stop the automatic destruction of objects after 3 seconds. Last but not least, the top left corner displays the user's mouse position in x &amp; y coordinates.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T06:13:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5ee036caa66bee61283dd720ec263f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JeffreyLin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
