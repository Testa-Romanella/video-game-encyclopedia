Built for last years's Flappy Jam, BS has you play as a mysterious azure bird that has to rescue 8 scattered princesses. Half platform game, half scavenger hunt with endless procedurally generated levels, those brave enough to rescue all princesses will then face the dark wizard, and unlock the secret identity of the Swan!</p><p>So basically this is an unfinished game and I want to know if it's worth even working on. I haven't worked on it since I missed the FJ deadline a whole lot. But what am I going to do with an unfinished game, am I right? Just sorta look at it and play it every once in a while? Nu-uh! Instead, I'm so good, I'm letting you guys check it out for less than a dollar. I might eventually put on real graphics and add some more secrets and stuff, joystick controls, co-op if there's an interest.</p><p>So is there?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e0010703d510374674ac7c8e37a00eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drawnder"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
