Your job is to halt evil in its tracks and attempt to close the portals to hell. You and your co-op team will explore maps by collecting keys and open doors from dead demons, purchasing weapons and bonuses from vending machines using your points generated by kills.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Waves of demons will be endless, but not without a twist. You will randomly experience \u2018Swarm\u2019 waves that will consist of small crawling demons that die easily but can quickly overpower any skilled gunman. You will also experience \u2018The Darkness\u2019. A wave dedicated to heightening your senses, where the lights will go out and using your trusted flashlight, giving you only a glimpse of the vision required to deal with the terror that awaits.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game will have a character select and a levelling system for guns, clothing items and other accessories. As well as initial achievements and bonuses which will be regularly updated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T02:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0c/a0c4d725f9b3fa4c24f78313d4975690.jpg", "website": "http://www.ellisgamesent.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 540, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ellis Games Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TBC"], "esrb_rating": null}
