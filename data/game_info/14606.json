{"id": 14606, "slug": "ricochet", "name": "Ricochet", "name_original": "Ricochet", "description": "<p>Ricochet is a multiplayer Half-Life mod developed by Valve.</p>\n<p>Richochet is a deathmatch game that closely resembles platformers. The game field is made out of several floating platforms which the players can jump on by stepping on one of the arrows on the edge of the platform.</p>\n<p>The objective is to push other players off the platforms using throwing discs - the only weapon present in the game. The player can&#39;t have more than 3 discs at the same time. The platforms are limited by a horizontal strip that can be used for ricocheting the discs. For pushing the player off with a direct hit, 1 point is scored. 2 for pushing the player off with a ricochet and 3 for double ricochet.</p>\n<p>There are two firing modes: single disc shot and the beheading shot that uses all three discs at once. </p>\n<p>In comparison to other Half-Life mods, the number of deaths is not tracked by in-game statistics. Overall, this mod is much more primitive than the others. Only 2D targeting is present and the player movement comes down to jumping from platform to platform.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T20:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120d930368bc171c42f9caab94e33c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 216, "owned": 3852, "beaten": 48, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 135}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 252, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 254, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Valve Software", "Nathaniel Stauffer", "Michael Stauffer"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Valve", "Nix Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
