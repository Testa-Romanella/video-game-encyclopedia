The premise being a young bat has to navigate a series of logic gates to get to school. I made an earlier version of this with half as many gates in November, but recently decided to expand it to include all the basic logic gates. I designed the gates to resemble both literal gates and symbols on circuit diagrams. Also, since graduating I guess I can't host this on the University's servers forever, right?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T08:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d59acae0ebf3f71f489f67277b0f7eed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlastLeatherwing"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
