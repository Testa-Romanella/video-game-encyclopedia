There\u2019s also music. Because I guess you have a radio?</p>\n<p>Controls are: A + D to pump your left and right pistons &amp; &lt;- + -&gt; to move your car. Pistons must be pumped in time with the music, but you may move freely. If you\u2019re feeling spunky, pump in double-time for bonus points!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4ebcdade9d61924dfcf25409e848c14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Khide Hoskins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
