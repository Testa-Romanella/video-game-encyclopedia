You return to your hometown to find clues to what really happened twenty years ago, when the town was set on fire. The mystery will unravel as you explore the dilapidated ruins.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt is an interactive reading experience envisioned in Unreal Engine 4, kind of a short-story in game format. You'll probably need a relatively powerful machine to run the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI made this game to learn weaving game and narrative together, and I made it over the course of two months. This is the first full game I've made so I'd love to hear if you like it. Three songs used in the game are made by Myuu<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Update 23-1-2017:</p>\n<p>I have fixed all found bugs, enhanced the ending and updated to a newer version of Unreal Engine.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fb95078d8e43f1a45af3e0fa0bc0566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philisophic Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
