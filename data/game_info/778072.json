It spawns 3D objects from users' right click and destroys them after a set time. There is also a dropdown that has the ability to change the shapes of the objects from spheres, cubes and cylinders. There is also a toggle that allows the objects to be destroyed or not. There are also three other toggles that randomize the objects color, scale, and rotation. On the bottom left of the screen there is now a clock included that shows the device's time. The project also includes a background now that changes with the time of day meaning dark during night and light during the day. New features added include a star prefab which is a new stroke for the paint brush, animation for the star prefab that makes the star\u2019s scale grow, makes the star rotate, and then moves the star's position in the shape of a triangle, and being able to press the \u2018M\u2019 button on your keyboard to make the menu on the left go away and respress to make it comeback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c7a47c2f3bf136a0c7b7c452667784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iag8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
