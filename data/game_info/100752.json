This game is / will be part of a label of games made \"hastily\", which is \"Shakecan Games\". The goal was to make this game in a week, and duplicate the old SNES game Pocky and Rocky to some extent. It went OK, though it lacks a lot (a lot of testing being one of those things it lacks) and went over time by a rather large margin. </p><p>So anyway, Pockette Rox is a top-down 2D shooter made with the Blender Game Engine. It's basically just a time attack game, where you see how many points you can get in a single \"go\". Every 10000 points, you get an extra life, as well. The game progressively gets a bit harder with each enemy you defeat, so you'll eventually die (hopefully eventually and not too soon). You can also play co-op by selecting 2 Player at the title screen. You share a life pool. If one of you end up dying with 0 lives left, then you'll be out for good until your partner can win another extra life.</p><p>Oh, and the game comes with the source code (the blend file and the associated assets in the... well, assets directory).</p><p>Well, that's the condensed version. Thanks for playing! If you have any feedback, throw it at me via Twitter.</p><p>- Just updated it to add in the readme file for Windows (and reverse the controls in there, too. Whoops). :p</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Follow me on Twitter at @SolarLune,</p><p>on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/user/solarlunetube,</p><p>and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/SolarLune.</p><p>I also have a homepage at plain ol' http://www.solarlune.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd62bd3077ce40818e21d85f9f29e1ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SolarLune"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
