Then in the 2nd screen you press play on the bottom left. If it doesn't work, go back and retry.</p>\n<p>IDEALLY:</p>\n<p>This should be played on a laptop that has a webcam and hooked up to a TV or large monitor with a cable. If you have no cable, you can still cast to your TV, but there will be a .3 second delay. Also, make sure the camera sees at least slightly below your knees. For desktop, you need a\u00a0webcam. Also remember to clear your play area because you will move a lot. Please don't smack your hands on the wall or stub your toes.</p>\n<p>If you want to check how you're graded, you can check the imagedata folder created wherever Amazing Dance Star is extracted to.\u00a090% of the time you're the one making the mistake, 10% of the time it's the pose estimation. Also, still a WIP. It's a miracle it even works on mmds at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to add a song, make sure it keeps once camera angle.\u00a0The program will work but you may be forced to twist your body to fit that camera angle. At least with a single camera angle the body motions are required to be at semi-human.</p>\n<p>if you want to record for youtube/social media\u00a0currently you need editing skills and the best setup probably would be to still stitch together the video recording of you and the actual video in your favorite video editor.</p>\n<p>please donate so that I can finish off this TODO list:</p>\n<ul><li>add multi person tracking (for songs and for group playing; think kpop or backup dancers with friends)</li><li>add simple motion commands (think: minority report)</li><li><li>add a record option so people don't have to get an external screen recording</li><li>hopefully down the line, android/ios version so you can just hook up your phone to a tv/monitor instead of a laptop</li><li>hire artists so the game looks nice</li><li>have bug reporting so that I can fix the pose estimation/train it better</li></li></ul>\n<p>What you should do:</p>\n<ul><li>playtest</li><li>share with ur friends, streamers, mmd creators</li><li>STRETCH BEFORE DANCING PLEASE</li><li>CHECK YOUR PLAY AREA SO YOU DONT HIT ANYTHING</li><li>have fun</li></ul>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS<br/></p>\n<ul><li>sometimes song would not load properly, to fix just go back to song selection and retry</li><li>score disappears at the end of a song\u00a0(I should only reset score when playing new song not at the end of a song)</li><li>stutter @ the end of video playback (it's an ffpyplayer problem)</li><li>i don't print out all of the images for some reason in imagedata</li><li>if colors are too similar (for example clothes and a background), the pose estimate will go wild and off mark.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T11:34:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9dd4a9eec7359626ed9182ddd30f6db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pengindoramu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
