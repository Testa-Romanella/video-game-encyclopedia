{"id": 736206, "slug": "banjo-dreamie", "name": "Banjo Dreamie", "name_original": "Banjo Dreamie", "description": "<p>Banjo-Dreamie is a N64 hack of Banjo-Kazooie by Loggo which began development in 2013 and was released in 2018. It is by far one of the most ambitious hacks of Banjo-Kazooie, consisting of a overworld and eight playable levels. The game wasn\u2019t made into a patch, so it can be played directly from the ROM without having to modify it at all. </p>\n<p>The game takes place in between of Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, consider it kind of like a BK 1.5. Loggo (the toilet from Mad Monster Mansion) obtained Gruntilda\u2019s magic and used it to create the Dreamy Depths, an area below Grunty\u2019s Lair. It\u2019s up to Banjo and Kazooie to get to him. The game doesn\u2019t have an intro cutscene like the original did, so you have to piece together what is going on from the clues within the game such as the environment and Loggo\u2019s taunts.</p>\n<p>This hack is based off of Banjo-Kazooie, not Banjo-Tooie, so don\u2019t expect to see all of the abilities and characters from that game in here. It does make good use of what it has though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-08T16:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71bb11a2aa2e7c670334fe4b493f6fe3.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sN4YoVL64&t=0s", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
