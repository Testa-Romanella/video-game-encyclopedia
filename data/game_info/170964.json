Shoot it down using the left 'shift' key or the right gamepad trigger.</p>\n<p>Flight is controlled with the arrow keys or left analog stick.</p>\n<p>Good luck</p>\n<p>Dont forget to post your best times :)</p>\n<p>Misc:</p>\n<p>I had originally wanted to control the ships movement independently from its direction but I had issues with controller mappings. If you want to try then out press the 'c' key to enable the (probably broken) alternate controls and 'c' again to switch back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/0499f19715ede3e50798844fdfae3691.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Baggers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
