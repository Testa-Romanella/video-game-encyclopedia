When I go out to hang with friends, I'm more focused on my phone than I am on them, People are just more focused on their screens. </p>\n<p>Which is why i came up with the idea for this game, I wanted to create an immersive game with screens to be able to explain to people that you don\u2019t constantly need to look further when the stuff in front of you is exactly what you\u2019re trying to capture\u2026..</p>\n<p>Best Way to experience the game is with headphones.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>USES STEAMVR...</p>\n<p>Trigger to aim Teleport and Trackpad button click to teleport. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Roam around the level and interact with things.</p>\n<p>Take in the views.</p>\n<p><strong>PC- NON VR</strong> </p>\n<p>No interactables - BUT the ability to drive the boat.</p>\n<p>WASD and MOUSE for movement</p>\n<p><em>Find me here</em></p>\n<p>Twitter.com/Chloex3 </p>\n<p>Instagram.com/chloesindiegames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-25T02:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb4821598f60ac299c465cde6baba7aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chloe Mooney"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
