The theme was unstable.</p>\n<p>At first we didn't have any idea what games we wanted to make, then, an idea bringing another, we decided to go for a safe utilisation of the theme. Nevertheless, we decided to take an original road from classic city builder.</p>\n<p>The physics implementation was easy with construct3, but find the right value was the challenge. Also, there is a lot of different things for beginners as we are, families in Construct3 prove themselves very useful !</p>\n<p>Also we had a technical problem for the game art. Unexpected delay comes, but in a final rush we make it 1h before the end.</p>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy Antstable !</p>\n<p>See you soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/866df058d10ad6fb288f8d4a4cae487f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kakapo's games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
