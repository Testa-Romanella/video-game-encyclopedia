It was created as a part of my 1st year final project, however due to the events of 2020 limiting classroom activity I didn't manage to implement all the mechanics id wanted.</p>\n<p>Id like to keep developing this project as I get better at game development, using it as some kind of milestone representation in my journey.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy what is available and please give me any feedback or possible ideas. They'd be much appreciated.\u00a0 :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>P.S. you can press esc to exit the game and holding shift provides a minor speed boost</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T05:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/74955ca69c45eb03ae81aa71813ef383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omi-san"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
