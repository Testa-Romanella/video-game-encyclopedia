He must journey through this \n      mysterious place, where he will have to find and remember the right path \n      in order to find her. Every room will challenge him with a simple choice \n      to make: left or right. Two doors, yet only one will make him go \n      forward; the other one will bring him back to the beginning.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Left-Right is a memory game filled with strange creatures and scary \n      bosses who will try to stop Billy from finding his dog. It is a pretty \n      simple and fun 2D game inspired by the old classic games, for which, \n      even after all these years, we still remember the button sequences to \n      avoid the punches or get 30 lives.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      The human memory is a very fascinating thing, and Left-Right is here to \n      test its limits. Will you be able to help Billy find Gigi? Or will she \n      be trapped forever in this crazy mansion? Enjoy!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T03:56:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Triple Boris"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Triple Boris"], "esrb_rating": null}
