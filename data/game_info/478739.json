In order to prevent tremendous late fees, you have to run around the store using electric rewinders and screw drivers to rewind the VHS, but the store is closing soon so you better hurry!</p>\n<p>Electric rewinders are quick and plentiful, but they don't rewind much. Screwdrivers are not as common, but rewind tapes further, at the cost of speed while you are focusing on rewinding.</p>\n<p>Don't get caught by the employees. Years of working retail have turned them into \"I'm Dead Inside\" retail zombies who only want you out of the store so they can close. Run into them, and they will send you back to the front door at a cost of time.</p>\n<p>Enjoy, and please leave a comment! More levels to come after the jam. 5 planned in total.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/5516ac25112d8c99c0adea00f6eba5c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CrazedLlamaz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
