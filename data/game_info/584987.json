{"id": 584987, "slug": "pin-brawl", "name": "PIN BRAWL", "name_original": "PIN BRAWL", "description": "<p>Pin Brawl is a hack-and-slash game, developed by Slash &amp; Slash. Using the WASD keys to move, and the mouse to aim, the player will wander sci-fi urban environments, completing objectives and destroying robotic enemies. Attacking can be done by using attacks tied to the left and right mouse buttons, and by pinballing enemies between players, themselves, and the environment.</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>\n<p>Pin-Brawl has some networking built into it that is hardcoded in. This means that it only connects to\u00a0certain computers, which means it may not be playable on every computer since it needs to connect to run.\u00a0It should work on most computers, but if clicking \"New Game\" doesn't do anything in the game, that's why. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused by this, but we did not have time to remove it upon realizing the problem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T06:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96c/96cf32f0993fa8f6ed99e60566594dd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neutralite", "sawyersw", "NuclearCosmo", "spengrantest", "Trogdor106"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
