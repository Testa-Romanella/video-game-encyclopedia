In the game&#39;s seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. You could be a regular run-of-the-mill Overlord. However, with incredible power at your disposal and a team of evil-minded impish critters, the Minions, on hand to do your bidding, how will you resist the temptation to be wonderfully despotic?!<br />\nGo deeper into the Overlord&#39;s twisted world as the single-player expansion content opens a series of hellish new levels, each a supernatural abyss for the game&#39;s five kingdoms: Mellow Hills, Evernight, Heaven&#39;s Peak, the Golden Halls and the Ruborian Desert. Access to each abyss is via a portal, which opens once a kingdom has been successfully conquered and the previous ruler banished to a personal hell within. However it&#39;s not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord&#39;s newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too.<br />\nWith the undead denizens of each abyss on the attack and threatening the Overlord&#39;s reign above ground, there&#39;s only one thing for it: assemble your minion army, descend into each abyss and embark on a fresh wave of tyranny in order to return the serfs to their homelands, defeat the fallen heroes once and for all, and claim the throne of each kingdom&#39;s underworld.<br />\nINCLUDES THE OVERLORD CHALLENGE PACK:<br />\nCome and have a go if your Overlord&#39;s hard enough.
