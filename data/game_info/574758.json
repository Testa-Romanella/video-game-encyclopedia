Press the corresponding number key, navigate to the target tile, and press that same key again to shoot.</li><li>You start with a\u00a0range of three tiles, and if you find a\u00a0bow, it will\u00a0increase your range.\u00a0</li><li>You gain an item after clearing a level. There is also an additional starting item on the ground in the first level.</li><li>Taking an item does not use\u00a0\ud83d\udc3e.

For example, the guitar will give you +1\u00a0\u2694\ufe0f for every beach area you travel to, or the bunny mask will give you +1\u00a0 \u2764 health every time you travel to the area to the left. If the area is both to the left and a beach, you would gain both bonuses by traveling to that area. Two guitars would also stack.</li><li>That being said, you cannot travel in the same direction twice.</li><li>You can see levels surrounding you in the top left. Your current level is in the middle of that grid, its slot is colored red.\u00a0and\u00a0certain levels might shift around you as you move from tile to tile.</li><li>\ud83c\udf32is a forest,\u00a0\ud83c\udf0bis a mountain,\u00a0\u00a0\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f is a beach</li><li>You will need to boost your attack in some way to win the game, due to enemy armor in later levels.</li><li>To win the game, clear the 10th level. The final fight will be different depending on the type of\u00a0level you find yourself in.</li></ul>\r\nThank you so much for playing and good luck!\r\n<p><em>A special thanks to Carla, IKnowKingRabbit, Marty McFly, and Trezy for their support in the creation of this game</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T10:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/061055be7e30fcd5d03293d38ecd2658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ontical"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
