The process is actually akin to artistry as you glide, slide and stretch the on-screen elements in an effort to create your own masterpiece.<br/>- James Woodcock<br/><br/>it&amp;#39;s amazing what you can do. I created this mountain layout entirely from scratch. I shaped every mountain, placed every tree, laid every track, and painted every texture. This is just scratching the surface of the library of objects you can choose from. None of it is cookie-cutter. It&amp;#39;s all user-controlled. Heck, even if you aren&amp;#39;t into trains, if you like creating cities or nature scenes or whatever, you can get totally engrossed in this app.<br/>- MacRumours.com Forum, redman 042<br/><br/>I was so surprised at the level of detail in this game.
