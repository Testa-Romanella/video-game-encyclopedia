A platformer with 2D/3D hybrid visuals. The objective is to reach the top of the tower, where a chest awaits. We integrated \"Revolution\" by having the player navigate around the faces of the tower, and also by implementing the Mouse Scroll Wheel into the gameplay. We didn't use any of the 3 Wild Cards.<br/><br/>https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-22<br/><br/>This was my first project working with a partner, who is my friend from school, Houndfall.\u00a0He made the sprites, textures, sounds, and most of the models using the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows 7</li><li>Blender 2.79</li><li>Fl Studio</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>Blender addon called Sprytile</li></ul>\n<p>I\u00a0assembled the assets, programmed\u00a0and\u00a0designed\u00a0the\u00a0stage\u00a0with the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Ubuntu 20.04</li><li>Godot Engine 3.2.1</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Blender 2.83</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa915cd2f0e851b375e7c27a1e4a37e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lettucepie", "Houndfall"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
