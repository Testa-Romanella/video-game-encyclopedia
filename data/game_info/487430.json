The aim is to stay alive as long as possible by killing zombies, but keep a close eye on your ammo because you run out before you know it. Throughout the map different buildings and ammo stashes are hidden. But don't stay in a building for too long, trust me, you can't hide for ever.</p>\n<p>This game is the result of a small game jam I held with a friend.<br/>I'm planning to expand on it in the future and maybe even implement\u00a0 a dungeon crawler type game mode.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>movement: WASD<br/>Weapon change: 123<br/>Shoot: leftmouse<br/>Aim: Cursor location<br/>Pause: Esc</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/<br/>zombie, gunshot and glass breaking\u00a0sounds:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download<br/>Footsteps:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/jamesrodavidson/<br/>building &amp; car destruction sound effect:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/onteca/<br/>background:\u00a0https://www.pxfuel.com/en/free-photo-orgvi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d488b689657ba58dbc8b4cc91cd57b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dannynohuman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
