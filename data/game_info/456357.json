So you decide to bake for them.</p>\n<p>You call your <strong>cooking kart</strong>, and start baking by <strong>hitting</strong> the workbench with your fist, to send the ingredients in the air. Then, you <strong>choose the one that you want</strong> to bake.\u00a0\u00a0Isn\u2019t your customer making a <strong>weird face</strong> when you are\u00a0selecting an ingredient? Yes\u2026 He must not like it. Let\u2019s push it away and\u00a0select only the ones that make him smile!\u00a0It looks like you have gathered all your ingredients and they are falling down on your table.\u00a0<em><strong>Quick</strong></em><strong><em>!</em></strong> <strong>Catch them by moving your bowl</strong> to avoid them to blow on the table! It would be too bad\u00a0to lose them.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ding!</strong></em> Your cake is done! No you can breathe and<strong> take your time to decorate</strong> your cake as you want, by letting your creativity running wild. <strong>Be careful</strong>, the customer is trying to catch one of your decoration items on the table! He looks pretty <strong>impatient </strong>to taste this wonderful cake. Now that you are done, simply give it to him and look at his crazy tasting reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>You did a good job</strong>, the villager loved your cake!\u00a0And as you can see, joy is slowly coming back to the village: flowers are growing, music is more powerful and colors are brighter.

We called our studio: <strong>Take Away studio</strong>.</p>\n<p>The instructions were to produce a <strong>vertical slice</strong> for a project, corresponding to the <strong>\"pre-production\"</strong> phase of the project. That is, among others, why\u00a0the shop is included in the game but not functionnal (we designed it but <strong>you cannot buy things from it</strong>!).</p>\n<p>During this exercise, we also thought of features for a final game:</p>\n<ul><li>Share your character and cakes on social media (the share button is on the game but cannot be used)</li><li>Customize your character (the customization is not integrated, but would include name, pronoun and appearance)</li><li>Travel through unique villages (multiple villages)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Producer and UI artist:\u00a0<strong>Manon VINCENT</strong></p>\n<p>Marketing Director and Assistant producer:\u00a0<strong>Alan THUILLIER</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Programmer:\u00a0<strong>Tristan RECORD</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Game Designer:\u00a0<strong>Maixent BOUTEILLER</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Artist:\u00a0<strong>Paul MEYER</strong></p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0<strong>Alexis GIRARDEY</strong></p>\n<p>Game Designer:\u00a0<strong>Fran\u00e7ois LOING</strong></p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0<strong>Cl\u00e9ment SABRIE</strong></p>\n<p>Sound Design:\u00a0<strong>Valentin BROUSSE </strong>&amp;\r\n<strong>Fabio PERSICHELLA</strong></p>\n<p>Composer:\u00a0<strong>Funny Face Music</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e32de8fc4bc25c591116e5d48beb7aff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["IIM - Video Game School", "Minstery", "Tristan Record", "Xanitem", "AleksGirardey", "Artcadya", "Alan Thuillier", "M3T4TR4P", "Paul Meyer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
