{"id": 559795, "slug": "robbin-the-hood", "name": "Robbin' (the) Hood", "name_original": "Robbin' (the) Hood", "description": "<p>I decided to do a game based on the recent controversy with the investment app Robinhood. Basically, one of the hedge funds that supports Robinhood was shorting Gamestop's stocks to make money. A Reddit group called Wallstreetbets saw this and decided to buy a bunch of Gamestop stock to make the hedge fund lose billions of dollars. Robinhood (and other investment brokers)\u00a0stepped in and prevented your everyday person from buying the stock. Robinhood still allowed people to sell stock. Many users (including me) were outraged because it seemed like Robinhood was not looking out for its users despite its name.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main character is Robinhood who purposefully does not have a face. Robinhood has the choice to take the money collected and give it to the poor or the rich. If money is given to the poor your score increases whereas if you give money to the rich your score decreases. If your score drops to 0 you lose the game. You also have to collect a key in order to unlock the next level.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Cipher - Electronic Light by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100844</p>\n<p>Artist: http://incompetech.com/</p>\n<p>Sound effect for money:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/bradwesson/sounds/135936/</p>\n<p>Playing seamless music across scenes:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33caa17cfdc68fc3758abdffd06a3d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BlueSage96"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
