An icon Is a the top left indicating which character you are currently controlling. Pressing shift will make the other character, if they are in a 1 tile radius, able to go onto the green walls. If you are on a green wall, you cannot use this ability. However, as soon as they move, they lose this ability. The blue walls are unable to be walked on. Put both characters on the weird-looking tiles to win the level. Press R to restart the level. You will know when you have won. (For clarity, it's when the level is merely a face). It fits the theme as alone, neither character is able to complete the levels, but they are not alone, and together they can win the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T08:37:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64b3d94a75821aba4f700040e912d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["neb.js"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
