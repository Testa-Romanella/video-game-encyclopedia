Click on other squares near your squares to see their power and then you can attack or trade with them.</p>\n<p>ATTACK</p>\n<p>By attacking them you will take their territory (square) but only if your power is bigger (there is always a chance to losing anyway), if you lose you lose resources.</p>\n<p>TRADE</p>\n<p>If you trade with a colour you will rise your relationship with that colour paying them resources. If you get to the top relationship level you can make an alliance with them. If you make war with a colour you reset your relationship with it to null.</p>\n<p>ALLIANCE</p>\n<p>If you make an alliance the colour will give you a bit of his power to you (showed in your page) during battles, but if you lose you also lose the alliance.
