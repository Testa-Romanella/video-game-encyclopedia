But killing by cutting them in melee is boring, so let's spice it up. Here you will need to aim and shoot swords to take down your enemies so you can advance to the next round!</p>\n<p><em>Knight's Hell\u00a0</em>is a bullet hell-kind of game that comes with six levels to complete, as well as two difficulties. There are\u00a03 levels in normal mode and 3 in hard mode. The normal mode is the human mode, where everyone can complete all the levels, but the real challenge starts in the hard mode. Will you be able to complete them all?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong> for the game:</p>\n<p>- <strong>WASD</strong> to move.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Mouse</strong> to <strong>aim </strong>and <strong>left click</strong> to <strong>shoot</strong>. You can press it down and the bullets will flow, you don't need to click each time you want to shoot.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to put the game on full screen!</p>\n<p>Creator's note: the game has no audio and no animations because this game was made for a task for a class and I didn't have the time or the knowledge to put them in the game. In a future patch it may be added.</p>\n<p>Assets used in the making of this game:</p>\n<p>- Tiles for the background as well as the characters:\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii\u00a0and\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Font used for all the text:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/es/8-bit-pusab.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/986e572da1a84b9ce291071f2cdb4266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Red Scoresby"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
