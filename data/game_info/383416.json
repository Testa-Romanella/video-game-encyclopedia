Find treasures, upgrade your equipment and try to uncover the riddle behind Calibal\u2019s Curse! Everyone\u2019s stuff is missing!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move C - Swap Weapon, or randomly generate seed on title screen X - Search Adjacent Tiles (friendly tiles adjacent or ontop of you will show as green numbers, enemy tiles will show up as red)</p>\n<p>Try to upgrade your equipment, find the boss and fight them to progress!</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEV NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>Phew, this was a huge crunch to get this to a playable state. I BELIEVE this should run without any hitches or issues, but I definitely had to work incredibly hard and certain assets couldn\u2019t be finished properly (for example, the intro cutscene is missing music).</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a LONG time since I submitted something solo for Ludum Dare. I tend to try and aim to build as complete a game package as possible. So far, this runs without any bugs, and seems like a reasonably complete game esp. considering the time limit, I\u2019m pretty proud of this lil thing. It definitely needs a lot more polish and a lot more love, but I\u2019d love to get people\u2019s thoughts!</p>\n<p>P.S: The dialogue is deliberately a shonky, just aiming for that \u201cold unknown NES game\u201d vibe, complete with mistranslations and weird grammar galore!</p>\n<p>If there are any crucially breaking bugs, lemme know and I\u2019ll try to get up a fix. The game runs fine to the end on GMS2 my side, so I\u2019d like to ensure everyone can get a good go at it! Balance might be a bit buggered of course due to the nature of making a game in 72 hours. Hope you guys have fun :D.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:37:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc53a99dacfd8c2e26c33dba077c0214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Anjin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
