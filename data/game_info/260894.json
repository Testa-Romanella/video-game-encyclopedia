It's inspired by the older\u00a0Puzzle Quest games, but\u00a0 it's a lot simpler with\u00a0Old Maid instead of Match-3 mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make matches, level up, and power your way through 10 battles.</p>\r\nDevtober\r\n\r\n<p>This is my entry for #devtober. If you don't know what devtober is it's like inktober, but for game developers. The idea is to challenge yourself to work on a project throughout the month by doing something game dev related every day. No rules - it's all about challenging yourself to improve your skills and finishing a project.</p>\n<p>I originally came up with this idea over a year ago and #devtober was the perfect chance to test it out. I had to strip a lot of the original features for the game to complete it within a month, but this game will serve as an excellent prototype for it. As such, I would love to hear your feedback on what you thought of the game! What did you like? What didn't you like? What features would you like to see added to the game? I had a ton of fun making this game over the course of a month and I look forward to future challenges!</p>\r\nFollow Me\r\n\r\n<p>Amateur indie dev making small games with Unity while I learn C#.
