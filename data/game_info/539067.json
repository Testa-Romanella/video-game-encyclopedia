This is astronaut combat more akin to dogfighting where your angle of attack and position can make all the difference.<br />\nPersonalize your protective space suit and your arsenal of modified weaponry. Be a keen eyed sharpshooter executing long range kills from afar or get in close and personal as an Assaulter, taking the fight forward.
