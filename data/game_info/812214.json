They just started appear up all over the world like a natural disaster. They have no goal, no plan. The World Eaters appeared out of nowhere. First in Europe, but after a day they filled the whole world. We called it Invasion. They wreak havoc and destruction everywhere, they destroy cities, they attack soldiers and civilians, and even each other. They keep appear. From now on, no one can feel safe and all that we can is to resist them for the sake of our survival. There is no other choice. <br/><br/>Join the ranks of the Hunters - an elite independent organization that will help fully realize your abilities. We fight where the military has failed. <strong>To become a Hunter</strong> means to take your future and the future of the world into your own hands!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Epicentrum is a gripping 3D turn-based tactical strategy in the best traditions of the genre. You will play as an elite demon hunter and resist the chaos in which the world has plunged, captured by incomprehensible monsters from another world. Play for one (or a group) of the hunters in generated single and multiplayer battles. Collect equipment and trophies, rely on tactics or luck, and most importantly - bravely fight dangerous enemies! You can be opposed not only by a soulless artificial intelligence, but also by any willing player who has enough place in the collective mind of the demons. Invite friends or strangers to your game and fight to become a LEGEND! While your overall goal is to tackle the highest threat, your personal goal is to become the greatest demon hunter in history. And, perhaps, somewhere along the way, reveal the secret of their Invasion.</strong><br/><br/><br/>Play alone or online! Compete with your partners, steal loot and heads of monsters right from under their noses, expose them under attack - become the best hunter and earn the most valuable trophies! But don't forget about the common goal! Don't let the monsters win!<br/><br/><br/>Become part of a natural disaster! Invade other players' battles as the collective mind of monsters. Vote for the actions of the monsters along with other participants and create hell for the Hunters who think about themselves!<br/><br/><br/>Stream viewers can take places among the hunters, join the collective mind of monsters, and for those who do not have enough space, I can influence the course of the battle by voting for round modifiers! Invite to your streams right in the game! Invite directly on the stream to the game!<br/><br/><br/>A classic turn-based tactical game with simplified rules and simple controls! Bet on luck or think over tactics! A player with any style of play will receive vivid emotions and can win!<br/><br/><br/>Random monsters. Random events. New tasks. Unique loot. Each battle is unique!<br/><br/><br/>Develop your hunter, unlock new monsters and weapons. Collect all the fragments of the Invasion secrets and reveal the backstory of all the heroes!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T05:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/94710e9770d61a369499b7c8d74104a2.jpg", "website": "http://fairgames.studio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fair Games Studio", "My Little Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Sad Horse studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
