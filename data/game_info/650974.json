It will not be so easy to do this, because the game has very subtle mechanics that complicate the process. Firstly, certain stones cannot be simply collected, one must try to remove others so that the necessary ones fall down and break, releasing their magic spells. Secondly, for each level you are given a limited amount of time. If you fail to meet, the wicked witch will curse you, but give you a second chance to improve.<br/>As the game progresses, it will become more difficult, or, if you master the skills of the game, it will become simpler. Marie will \"add fuel to the fire\" by dropping burning stones that destroy neighboring ones, use magic and enchant stones with a certain rune in order to get more mana from them, because every time she needs it more and more, and she will ask her before the end of the centuries.<br/> Try to please the witch Marie in Witch Stone! <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:36:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d807ddb63399db4d27d2dca37100bfcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crooked Road"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
