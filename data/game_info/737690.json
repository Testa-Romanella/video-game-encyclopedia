The character is 100% inspired by a clay (hard playdough...foam?) alien she made, and I loved the design so much, that I decided to create a game for her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since I forgot to start the game until a few days before her birthday, yeah...this is pretty rushed. But, I'll work on the game some more after her birthday, so If you enjoy it, great!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY<br/></p>\n<ul><li>This is an HTML5, browser game.</li><li>Use the Left, Right to MOVE.</li><li>Use the Down arrow key to JUMP DOWN from certain platforms.</li><li>Use the Spacebar key to JUMP, and hold down to FLOAT in the air!\u00a0</li><li>THE \"ABOUT\" &amp; \"NEXT LEVEL\"\u00a0BUTTONS DO NOT WORK.
