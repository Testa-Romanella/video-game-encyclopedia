I literally have no idea why this happens, but the game was built using only 4 colours (Black, White, Grey, Red). I will try to fix this in the future (if possible).</p><p>See below for controls.</p>\n<p>Humanity is on the back-foot. Demon-Kind has almost completed its global conquest, and it is your mission to secure its victory. Disguised as a human, infiltrate the human 'Centre for Demon Intelligence', \u00a0destroying intel, and weakening the human forces. However, avoid being discovered - the balance of global domination lies in your hands.</p>\n<p>Note: Try fullscreen if sizing issues! Controls: Mouse only. You can reload the\u00a0game from the conclusion screen.</p>\n<p>I had a corrupted file halfway through development (&amp; several other issues with Unity), so had to build from scratch in a new engine (Twine). So there are some missing features that I wanted to implement but wasn't sure how (it was my first time using Twine). Either way, I hope you enjoy, and make sure to leave a comment and a rating!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/230b2e55e9721e08583f3bdeb2131adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CheeseDawgyDawg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
