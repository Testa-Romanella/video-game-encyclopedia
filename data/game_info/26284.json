Create a \n      teddy bear and customize it to fit your own style. Choose its name and \n      gender and dress it up by combining elements from plenty of clothes and \n      accessories. Play solo or engage your family and friends to compete in \n      one of the multi-player modes. Even 16 players can take part in one \n      competition! Thanks to the balanced levels of difficulty (kid, \n      youngster, adult) everyone can enjoy the game. This collection of casual \n      winter sports provides a new game-play experience to the whole family to \n      the accompaniment of a great Christmas soundtrack.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1a0fdd1065c308451b35b17292a8e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Teyon"], "esrb_rating": null}
