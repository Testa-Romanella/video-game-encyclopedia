{"id": 500773, "slug": "wild-ride-itch-captain-dreamcast", "name": "Wild Ride (itch) (Captain Dreamcast)", "name_original": "Wild Ride (itch) (Captain Dreamcast)", "description": "<p>There is very few things Non-Player-Characters (NPC as us pro gamers call them) have to fear: They don\u2019t have to pay taxes, they don\u2019t have to hold smalltalk (except when they do) and they don\u2019t have to worry about Ludum Dare deadlines. But there is one thing, one singular thing that all NPCs fear more than we possibly can imagine, that makes them say \u201cNo, please\u201d instead of \u201cI am error\u201d: Being on the wrong end of a malevolent omnipotent being in a simulation game. Dan Stuckmann suffered such a fate: A nice day at the amusement park turned into a life-altering event as he found himself stuck on the \u201cWild Ride\u201d for over 50 years (in case you can\u2019t imagine the horror, that\u2019s 50 years of amusement park food). But he has not given up hope yet and has come up with a crazy plan to escape the \u201cWild Ride\u201d even if he himself won\u2019t be around to see it anymore.</p>\n<p>So yeah, this game is based on a popular\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019d call it, a story? It\u2019s based on the popular story of Mr. Bones\u2019 Wild Ride, in which a Rollercoaster Tycoon player describes in great detail how they tormented their little men inside the game by forcing them into an eternal loop of riding the coaster (here\u2019s an imgur link if you\u2019ve never seen it before, it\u2019s pretty funny). Originally I wanted to make it more about survival on top of the coaster, but that was pretty boring, so after the first day, I threw everything out and made it a physics game instead. Hope the physics aren\u2019t too wonky, I tried to prefer \u201cfeeling good\u201d over realism but it\u2019s still a struggle. But that\u2019s what the Ludum Dare is for, right? Trying stuff.</p>\n<p>Either way, thanks a lot for playing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows/HTML5:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Return to game title-&gt; Exit game - Escape</li><li>Hack at coaster / Advance text - A</li><li>Speed up - Hold left when on rails</li><li>Speed down - Hold right when on rails</li><li>Leave Title Screen - Enter</li><li>Reset to checkpoint - R</li><li>Full screen: CTRL + Enter for Windows / F8 for Web (make sure to click game in firefox first or fullscreen will fail)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls for Dreamcast (and controller):</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Return to game title -&gt; menu -&gt; collection title -&gt; Exit game - A+B+X+Y+START (Standard Dreamcast return to title combo)</li><li>Hack at coaster / Advance text - A\r\n</li><li>Speed up - Hold left when on rails\r\n</li><li>Speed down - Hold right when on rails</li><li>Leave Title Screen - Start\r\n</li><li>Reset to checkpoint - R trigger</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Original release date: 10/05/2020</li><li>Source code is on\u00a0<strong>github</strong>:\u00a0http://github.com/CaptainDreamcast/WildRide/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e8390fba84dc545a4f556d81463aa25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
