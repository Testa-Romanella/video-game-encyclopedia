Every module can connect to every other module - a white dot represents a docking point. Line this up with the rear of a any other module and they will attach, combining the controls and abilities and eliminating the need to \u00a0switch between module types.</p>\n<p>You can build you craft alone or, as intended, with friends, all controlling different aspects of the craft.</p>\n<p>Then kill everything else.</p>\n<p>PS: at present nothing is attacking you - this peaceful facade will not hold up for long (as in the next update I will incorporate ultra-violent malicious AI to accompany you on your journey).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/7273c2fea5b88f4a2f8507d36bc9cffc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nonzerosum"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
