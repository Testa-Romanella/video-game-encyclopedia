As space mercenaries, known as Raiders, players will team up with two others to explore the derelict stations taken over by sentient AI. As a Raider, your goal is to extract valuable weapons and resources for your faction. Players will customize a loadout and venture into procedurally generated ships making each match unique. Work alone or together to overcome the ship's deadly traps and defenses in order to escape. However, beware of the other Raiders seeking the same riches.<h3>Key Features</h3><br/><ul><li> <strong>Tactical PVP Combat:</strong> Use a variety of weapons, equipment, and ship hazards to take out other players and survive each mission.
