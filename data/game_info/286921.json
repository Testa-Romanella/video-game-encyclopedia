This\u00a0 heavily influences the tasks\u00a0 they will perform.\u00a0Move virtues\u00a0 up and down, bottom most\u00a0 virtues will rarely\u00a0 be executed (but not guaranteed they wont be) and the top most virtue will receive\u00a0 the highest chance any single pawn will perform it. It also directly\u00a0 influences\u00a0 a pawns life-long influence from birth. Plan your changes ahead,\u00a0 as they sometimes can take a short bit to take effect, and undoing that change isn't\u00a0 immediate.<br/><br/>Pawns self determine what they are going to do for the next cycle (somewhere around 10s or so).\u00a0\u00a0This is influenced by their preference that cycle, what they were born with, the current\u00a0 top most virtue, and some\u00a0 random chance.<br/><br/>The first activity you can perform is\u00a0 simply breed, which maintains or grows population. You can also build, most\u00a0 building\u00a0 requires stone blocks once you build the quarry. Builders with nothing to build will join the breeding pool.<br/><br/>Some basic genetics are passed on, every new generation is born with a sum of the WorkOutput (hidden value) of the previous generation, as well as\u00a0 a boost from the NEXT GEN X modifier once you unlock the gym. While small at first, these bonuses can have a tremendous impact .<br/><br/>The farm produces food, which both extends your population cap and is needed to spawn new pawns beyond the base population cap of 99. It can be tricky to balance food with growth, but a high population can make the game go very quickly when combined with a high WorkOutput.<br/></p>\n<p>Your final goal is to produce enough work\u00a0 on the CUBE to break it open to see\u00a0 what is inside. This takes a LOT of stone block and work, but becomes quite easy once you boost a few\u00a0 things.<br/><br/><strong>Winning</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Start with setting build to highest</p><p>2. Once the quarry (hole in the ground) is built, set quarry to the highest and gather block</p><p>3. Keep bouncing quarry/build until you get to the gym</p>\n<p>4. Prioritize strength training for awhile, this slowly increases the work output of ALL newly made pawns across the\u00a0 board\u00a0 (persistent)</p>\n<p>5. Once you start seeing high NEXT GEN X #'s, try bumping\u00a0 up farming and get a ton of\u00a0 food, then prioritize breeding until you have a ton of pawns.</p>\n<p>6. Bounce quarry/cube to tackle that beast. Return to previous things if you run out/start\u00a0 losing food and can't\u00a0 maintain high population</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fdbeb390182d470a38738d1646c6120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gestalt Engine"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
