(GMTK 2021 GameJam)</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made asteroids! But in this game, the asteroid speed is\u00a0<strong>tied to\u00a0</strong>the players speed. You could say the two speeds are... joined together? When you move faster, the asteroids move faster, so be careful! While the controls here are rough, I\u00a0think there's the seed of a great game here, so I'll improve it over time.</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Kubbi - Digestive Biscuit</p>\n<p>Art/Sfx:\u00a0Me</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Left/Right Arrows to turn</p>\n<p>Up Arrow to move<br/></p>\n<p>Space to shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d049f0934a5059961b364ca591ee0ca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OmegaFalcon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
