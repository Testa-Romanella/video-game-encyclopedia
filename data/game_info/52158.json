{"id": 52158, "slug": "aqua-kitty-udx", "name": "AQUA KITTY UDX", "name_original": "AQUA KITTY UDX", "description": "<strong>AQUA KITTY UDX </strong>blasts onto Steam in this enhanced Ultra Deluxe Edition including an epic Dreadnought mode!<br/><br/>You and your team of milk mining kittens have overcome a fear of water to drill down under the ocean seabed and begin extracting vast reserves of what seems to be naturally forming full-fat milk. Get ready for fast-paced submarine action, defending the kittens from disruptive mechanical sea creatures.<br/><br/><strong>PLEASE NOTE - Buying this game also includes `AQUA KITTY - Milk Mine Defender` at no extra cost!</strong><br/><br/><br/> In the game you can choose from 3 different main game modes:<br/><br/><strong>CLASSIC</strong> - The regular game mode, clear waves of robotic sea creatures whilst protecting milk mining kittens. There are 4 sea areas, each with a large boss enemy at the end. Work your way across the map via any route you prefer. ALSO try the special Infinite Espresso challenge level, where there are no milk pumps to defend and the enemy waves just keep on coming!<br/><strong>ARCADE</strong> - This is a twist on the main game mode, with the addition of gems you collect and use to buy upgrades. These upgrades persist across levels.<br/><br/><strong>DREADNOUGHT</strong> - The newest game mode is set deep underwater where you must fly through huge multi-screen enemy dreadnought ships, weaken them by blasting parts off to expose the shielded weak point, and then destroy the core!!! (all whilst trying to free imprisoned cats!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of the enhancements compared to the original Milk Mine Defender game:<br/>Extra Bosses (one per sea area).<br/>New Dreadnought mode with 13 increasingly humongous dreadnoughts to battle and destroy.<br/>Improved visuals such as new parallax scrolling skies and other enhanced graphical effects.<br/>Rebalanced gameplay.<br/><br/>Please note - The game is best played with an Xbox or PS4 controller, as controllers with analogue sticks give the most precise movement control. Keyboard control is also supported. Mouse control is not supported.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T05:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/ceec9529cd4d80d318500b38cc8bfd69.jpg", "website": "https://tikipod.com/aquakitty/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 533, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Tikipod"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tikipod"], "esrb_rating": null}
