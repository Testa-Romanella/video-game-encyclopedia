When the aliens came, their ships were dark and peaceful, but then it started. The aliens destroyed all the major cities and moved on to annihilate the entire planet Earth. Nothing was left standing. Now they hunt for survivors and you're one of them. You are the last man standing, but you are not alone in the universe. With the help of an alien spaceship, you find your way to a distant galaxy, where you can begin a new life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFind weapons, find food, find water and hopefully, you'll find a way go back to Earth and maybe get your revenge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc806941d5462eb09298766d7269f6d7.jpg", "website": "http://mundiproject.wix.com/mpstudios", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 56}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MP Game Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["MP Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
