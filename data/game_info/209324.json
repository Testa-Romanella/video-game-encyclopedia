Afterwards, I had horror games on my mind. I started wondering if it's possible to make a horror game which is not story based. Can a game be scary by its mechanics alone?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSo I tried to make a game as an answer to that question. The game is nothing but mechanics, with a very basic premise established with a few lines of text. Then you're on your own!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou control a family of 4 whose house is suddenly beset by a herd of zombies. These are old zombies though: slow and dumb. Move your family members around the house, close doors and barricade the rooms, and see how long you can survive.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSomething interesting I found out while working on a fog of war mechanic is that it cut out a lot of the tension. By default, you can see where the zombies are throughout the house, and I think that's more stressful than not being able to see them. So I removed the option of fog of war. Lesson learned: fog of war isn't always an interesting mechanic to have.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt was quite fun to make a turn-based simulator around a horror theme. Hopefully it succeeds in making players feel anxious and helpless!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3145dc28711dc621a7ea2cbf76680ed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xavier Stamps-Lafont"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
