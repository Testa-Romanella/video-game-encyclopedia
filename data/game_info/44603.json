One day when I was traveling in the Forest of Banagher, I caught a glimpse of some nearby deer. However, they were not the only beings that caught my attention. A white wolf was nearing our mutual prey when a few mortals entered my canvas.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNodens' journey will take you from Forest of Banagher to the Mountain of Bhollain.
