Probably the last sentence our heroine Zephia remembers before waking up in front of a clock tower without any clue who she is and why she's even there. At her side is\u00a0Nova. He's Zephias companion and the key trigger to her abilitys. Together they're trying to find out what happened to the world and to her.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nMy dear Kohais!\r\n<p>Everything you see has been created in a time frame of 2 months. I guess you can\u00a0 imagine what the game will look like in a year! This little pre alpha was requested by my beloved kohais and it gives you guys just a small hint how the gameplay is going to feel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, there's still a long bumpy road ahead and we're missing a lot of core systems like inventory, loot,\u00a0 attributes, skills... and so on. Don't worry, IT WILL BE implemented!</p>\n<p>Thank you for believing in us!</p>\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Currently, we're a team of two people -\u00a0Gamedevelopment, Art &amp;\u00a0Socialmedia is managed by myself\u00a0dekisenpaitm.\u00a0All of the music &amp; sound effects are created and managed by nicosenpaitm.\u00a0 Nico is one of my best friends and has created music for about 15+ years. I'm very much a beginner and started my gamedev/art journey around April 2022 - you see I'm still learning so please bear this in mind when giving feedback haha..haha....ha *nervous laugther*.</p>\r\n\r\nMy Goal\r\n<p>I want to create a modern Zelda pixelarty RPG influenced by some\u00a0Dark Souls aspects with additional features! Here are some special function (not talking about core functions) I'd love to implement:</p>\n<ul><li>A follower system - follower transforms into different weapons and can change attributes by crafting/looting certain items.</li><li>Additional weapons which can be summoned and refined~ and by additional I mean a lot! Each with a special skill/movement pattern.</li><li>Three different meele weapon types - Light, Medium and Heavy.</li><li>Attribute/Skill upgrade through certain items rather then grinding hours for exp.</li><li>Different story endings (not gonna spoil too much here, hehe)</li></ul>\n<p>and more!</p>\r\nSupport us\r\n<p>The first thing each and everyone can do to support us is actually for free! You can follow, like, share and comment our social media profiles and posts - this is already helping a lot!!</p>\n<p>If you really want, nobody's forcing you and YOU CAN AFFORD IT!
