I'd greatly appreciate any feedback you have on the locomotion system, as I am not sure how stomach-churning it might be for some folk.</p>\n<p>I've left a testing-environment in there as well (press B or Y on the Touch controller).\u00a0</p>\r\ninstallation\r\n<p><strong>QUEST:\u00a0</strong>You\u2019ll need to sideload this .apk to your quest yourself. It\u2019s not too difficult -- if you have Android dev experience it's a walk in the park.\u00a0You\u2019ll probably want to use adb, although tools like SideQuest may also make this more accessible.
