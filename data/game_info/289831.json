I have to ask cause you know, I'm standing here looking up at the sky and it looks like its pretty high. James Franco high.</p>\n<p>Get your name on the leader-board to fulfil your manifest destiny. With the right stuff in Space Force One the rest of us can sleep safe, except for my neighbour George. He's paranoid, and a flat-earther. You don't have to protect him. The CIA fed him LSD throughout the late sixties. We've all seen his dossier on the dark web. A real Jordan Peterson fanatic. I digress. The Secret Service is watching (always) so we'll let you know when you're Space Force material recruit. Until you get a LinkedIn message keep training.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/addbdd3c0e15b4075e0849048cad223b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["penfolds5"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
