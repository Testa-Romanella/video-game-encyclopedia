And I didn't really get to program in anything except the very minimum of the idea I had.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f4aa27aeada7aecbe97f6cc07e08cac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["5minutegames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
