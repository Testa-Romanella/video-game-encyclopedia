You move your droplet ether by flinging it through the air or by sliding down the surfaces. Avoid shrinking by being in the light of the sun and avoid getting too close to the lava. Travel through the desert, and into the anthill. Fly-past the ants and do not touch them or risk being taken away. Be careful around the lava lakes not to evaporate. Will you bring water back to the world?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3eb72abfb42a95c6de9ba68c4899925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["linkd5625", "NickCasey72"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
