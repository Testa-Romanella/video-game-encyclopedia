I\u2019m a very busy person, I\u2019m a member of a FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics team, a member of multiple clubs such as Theatre Tech, Yearbook, and more. Long story short, I\u2019m busy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the purpose of the Ludwig Jam is to create new games for Ludwig to play in streams.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As such, rather than presenting you will a complete game, I\u2019m presenting you with this concept of a game. If I had perhaps a week or two longer, I would be able to implement the art (which I already have created lol just needed like one or two more hours), the gamemodes I have temporarily disabled as they aren\u2019t stable enough, and just overall a more fun and more developed game.\r\n</p><p>To see a more developed version of the game (with seeds and stuff like that) check it out here\u00a0https://thesimg.github.io/astralis-alpha/</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It is currently 5:57 ET and there are 3 minutes until deadline, so I\u2019m going to keep this brief.
