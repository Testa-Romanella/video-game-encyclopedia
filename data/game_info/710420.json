That must be very difficult. Whoever plays it will surely Cry for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words spoken by my teammates made me even more intrigued by this idea, yes!! We will do it!!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Candy Knight Game is a 2D side-by-side game, the player takes on the role of a knight who must defeat the demons that destroy the Kingdom of Candy and restore peace to the Kingdom of Candy.</p>\n\n\n<p>In terms of story, theme and concept, we try to make this game a Tales about the Knight and the Candy Kingdom So our game will have storytelling and art work to be simple and charming as if we are in a storybook. In the storytelling section, we will try to make it look like a hand-drawn storybook. So sometimes we try to write to make the picture look like a sketch.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>What is important and charming of this game is its difficulty!!</p>\n<p>The game has no save point, no map, slow attack, and most importantly, if you are hit by an enemy, attacked or hit by a thorn, you will die instantly!! And you will have to go back to the beginning and play again. Gravity system that can't jump quickly because you're always carrying the hammer around. and because it is a hammer You can attack slowly. Plus a single hit can kill you. That's it, we'll get a hell of a game like the candy knight game. May you all have fun playing together?</p>\n\n\n<p>( This game does not support the use of joy-controllers. You'll need a keyboard to play for equal difficulty.)</p>\n\n\n<p>Have fun? with our game.<br/>Play on WebGL<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4eec7b953a9c3d7db2a6248f99d1480f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRAVE PAINTER"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
