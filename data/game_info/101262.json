Neil is from another planet in another solar system in another\u00a0galaxy,\u00a0he lives\u00a0around\u00a0\"RA 0h 42m 44s | Dec +41\u00b0 16\u2032 9\",\u00a0cool right!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neil has a family, a wife, a couple kids, a pet and a job to support all these things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Neil received a package which isn't usually good news because gift giving isn't really a custom where he's from. Alas the package is from the One Government. Neil took the package into his....house?...Dwelling??....anyway luckily the package had wheels because it was heavy and half his size, just one of the many ways the One Government looks after its denizens.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neil continues to open the package which in true One Government form was very easy to open. Inside was a\u00a0GearJump\u00a0Suit and a note.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Neil was a winner which\u00a0isn't\u00a0usually good news because giving away prizes isn't really a custom where he's from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How interesting, a\u00a0GearJump\u00a0Suit! An excellent and exquisite piece of wearable machinery. This suit is almost solely responsible for the great developments that happened on Neils home planet. The\u00a0GearJump\u00a0Suit has a few functions, primarily the suit was made to reinforce and give power to the legs allowing the\u00a0wearer\u00a0to easily scale terrain that otherwise would be too much effort to traverse by making it easy to leap and\u00a0bound\u00a0over objects and gaps. The best thing is, as long as you land on your feet you can jump or fall from any height and you will be completely fine. Over the epochs, features and improvements have been added to the suit to make it even more useful, for instance, a core was added to allow for teleportation, as long as you knew the coordinates you could teleport short distances. With the addition of a\u00a0filter less\u00a0gas mask that never needs changing by connecting to the heart, the suit was becoming perfect for industrial tasks such as mining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\r\nare 2 ways you can get the\u00a0suit,\u00a0you\r\nare either rich or you work for the government.\u00a0Strangely\u00a0Neil\r\ndidn\u2019t\u00a0fulfill\u00a0any of\r\nthose\u00a0criteria.\u00a0What's\u00a0stranger\r\nis\u00a0that\u00a0the One Government\u00a0was\r\nsupposed to be stopping\u00a0their\u00a0reliance\r\non the suit since the latest\u00a0improvements\u00a0made\r\nto the suits jumping capabilities caused the suit\u00a0to\r\nbe unstable which was less than perfect since\u00a0the\u00a0suit\u00a0started\r\nto have a body count.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Well anyway Neil reads the note\u00a0that was included in the package,\u00a0it's\u00a0just a bunch of\u00a0coordinates. Neil rolls his eyes and pockets the note.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0Neil......kisses??.....his wife and kids and leaves which\u00a0isn't\u00a0usually good news because showing affection isn't really a custom where he's from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b4686fb54b7f75ef7f6da6a45c3d8da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["onceblank"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
