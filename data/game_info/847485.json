This game more so than any other I've worked on perhaps is the most off the cuff and ramble-y, as I made it all within the hours of 1:30 AM - 4:30 AM, but I hope you enjoy it regardless! Either way, thank you for playing! And don't forget to check out all the other participants in this month's Bitsy Jam!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:24:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e3683b2ddd7bb6a444c500e965b7a9c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
