Venture out into the forest to find the stolen treasure from the ghost, skeletal pirate. Using your unique abilities, experience challenging platforming and fight the skeletal pirate's minions along the way. Collect rubies and finish levels with your best time to positively boost your score at the end of each level.\u00a0In the Windows version, there is a save system and level selector for a more relaxed experience or if you want to head to levels you loved playing the most. Currently, the browser version does not have the save system and level selector. So, if you want a more challenging experience, speed-run the game and see how far you can get without any saves. But don't worry, there are still checkpoints within the level to start back from if you die.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T07:01:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a61c33c9b0269b9e8daaed1820a61587.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["the-True-Blue"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
