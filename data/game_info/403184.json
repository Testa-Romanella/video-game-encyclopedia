Run around and find cool objects to interact with! Earn points and time bonuses\u00a0every time you interact with them! Die to live again! Compete with people on an online leaderboard for the highest score! Why? I don't know! But it's kinda fun!\u00a0You are a totally\u00a0blessed highly intelligent being, don't squander your totally meaningful existence as a corporeal entity of this sacred realm and dimension!</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: Building to WebGL broke online highscores! Sorry! Working on fixing it right now!</p>\n<p>NOTE: I will be updating this and working on it a bit after the Jam ends, there's a good things that I want to iron out and stuff I want to\u00a0add and change\u00a0before I consider this game \"finished\". Such as replacing the \"programmer art\", adding some post processing, adding at least 8\u00a0more suicide objects, mechanics and features, and larger or multiple in-depth\u00a0maps.\u00a0This build currently isn't perfect, but it's basically complete other than like 10 more lines of code!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d0f7cf23db03cf3b66acfcbf8751bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pseudonym_Tim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
