This game is all about speed, endurance and reflexes, therefore you will only beat it if you tap so fast like there is no tomorrow! It is meant to be played when you are angry, nervous or frustrated because after 5 - 10 minutes of playtime you will be physically drained and hopefully, more calm. It is best to be played in short bursts so you can come back for more, over and over again. Extremely easy to play but hard to endure. Add to that beautiful graphics, funny animations and energetic music and you have full package.
