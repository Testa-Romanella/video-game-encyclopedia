The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards.<br/><br/>In our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.<br/><br/>Don't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13814dba6843e7481c1e7726449331e_tmhODMr.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaspmobilegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["GASP Mobile Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
