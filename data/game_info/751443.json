I learned about Boolean triggers and used them to set a firerate for the basic cannon fire. I also learned about level design and made my own coarse based on the original tank game I used an invisible border to figure out where I would place the mines at. the reason I call it Shower Tank is because the structure and colors ended up looking like a tiled shower floor. XD\u00a0Finally, the last part of the lesson tasked me with adding a NEW FEATURE to the game. I chose to add a spawning powerup that gives you a new rapid fire weapon for six seconds. The chalenge is they spawn in some hard to reach places and one hit with rapidfire only gets you 0.1 points instead of a full point. But with some skill you could you could get a few full points with it as well. I hope it turns out to be pretty cool!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa2fd2fca23b8531d411f5bd860f707e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The JL ZONE"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
