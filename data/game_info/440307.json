Blast your way through proceduraly generated prison cells. Shoot anything that stands between you and freedom. Engage in laser shootouts with prison guards, put up shield and use cover to stay alive. Visual theme and gun operation is heavily\u00a0inspired\u00a0by Eric Chahi's Another\u00a0World.</p>\n<p>Game was programmed in Lua using L\u00d6VR framework. Only used assets are sounds, everything else is code-based graphics and procedural level generation. Whole thing is about 1600 lines of Lua code. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Right hand holds the weapon. Shoot with trigger. </li><li>Hold trigger for short time to charge a static shield. Shield stays up only for several seconds.</li><li>Hold trigger for long time to charge a powerful blast ray. This is necessary for blasting through doors and enemy shields.</li><li>Left hand trigger is used for teleportation.</li><li>Smooth locomotion and rotation is available on left and right thumbsticks.</li></ul><p>Game was developed and extensively tested on Oculus Quest. The used framework supports some other platforms:\u00a0Vive, Index, Rift, Rift S, Quest via Link, and Windows Mixed Reality Headsets. These were not really tested, please report if they work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2fc9fb2d8a2e1eb9bb13eafddaaed0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["jmiskovic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
