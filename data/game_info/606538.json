Building the world proved to be a lot more fun than I\u00a0was expecting, and I hope that whomever experiences it enjoys it too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T08:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/409452f378c5d9de4e0a9fdcdc7adab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDD114"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
