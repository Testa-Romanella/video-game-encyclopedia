Rawr!</h3><h3>Story</h3>Slobbish Dragon Princess LOVE + PLUS is a collection of short stories that focus on the heroines of Slobbish Dragon Princess. Takeru's life is turned upside down when dragons suddenly invade from the skies and a lizard he found on the side of the road transforms into a beautiful girl named Haru who is also apparently a princess of the dragons! Haru convinces the dragons to spare humankind and comes to live with Takeru to get the full NEET life experience. How will Takeru's life change with these less than ordinary change of events?<h3>HARU SCENARIO</h3>While out for a walk, Haru sees some neighborhood kids going to the pool. Growing curious, she begs Takeru to take her to the pool as well but he has no interest in doing so and turns her down. Suzuka feels sorry for Haru and invites her out to the beach with some friends.<h3>SUZUKA SCENARIO</h3>Suzuka is fatigued from trying to prepare for an upcoming doujin event. By change, Haru happens to catch a glimpse of Suzuka's manuscript and is very succinct in pointing out the problems with it. And thus she's conscripted as Suzuka's editor-in-chief. Somehow, Suzuka manages to finish in time and even Takeru gets roped into participating at the event.<h3>DORAMI SCENARIO</h3>Dorami continues to contemplate on how to get Haru to join her church. In a meeting with her followers, it's determined that the only course of action is to make peace with Takeru to get to Haru. Thus a strange operation is hatched to ensnare Takeru for that purpose.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Three short stories featuring Haru, Suzuka, and Dorami!<br/></li><li>Art by Takano Yuki (NEKO-NIN series, Da Capo)<br/></li><li>English and traditional Chinese language options<br/></li><li>Japanese voice acting<br/></li><li>Extras gallery for CGs/OP Movie/Favorited voice lines<br/></li><li>NEET dragon girls</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T03:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/0637ec3bddd1dab1b6d40d371a572f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 448, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whirlpool"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
