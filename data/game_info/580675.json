In here you will find a relaxing atmosphere full of many places to explore and see to gain insight on the looming threat that is to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a very early build, there are several game mechanics missing, almost everything except for map design is going to change in time. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy exploring for a few minutes or maybe even an hour as much as I had fun creating this world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any support such as criticisms, things you would like to see, and more would be greatly appreciated by me. Thank you so much!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/683/683b0607d1b2862f1b0781d85de026ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bepis Brewer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
