Each level gradually gets harder.</p>\n<p>Click anywhere on the screen and pull in the opposite direction that you intend the ball to travel. You will need to judge the power for each shot and collect as many or as few coins as you like.\r\n</p>\n<p>The coins have no effect on the game at all, so far. But, I have ideas for the future where I want to go with them.\r\n</p>\n<p>New levels will be added regularly. Maybe, every week for the first while, then down to monthly, but I'll update you all if anything changes, so keep an eye on the Devlog.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this very early preview as much as I have enjoyed making it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Any donations are very much appreciated and help me continue spending time making this and other games.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b0c0931fe96952ae2cc97bf56857bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DibDab Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
