The objective of the puzzle is to exchange the white and the black bishops' positions.</p>\n<p>2. The chess board is a 5x4 board which restricts the movement</p>\n<p>3. All the pieces are on the same color.</p>\n<p>4. No Bishop of different color can come in the attack range of another (programmed in the game).</p>\n\n<p>That's it!!</p>\n<p>If you solve it, make sure to send me a screenshot/moves you did to solve the puzzle on my email kshitijaucharmal21@gmail.com</p>\n<p>THANK YOU!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T18:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bb/7bb513eeec4424a1ec8e20b7f97fffb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kshitij Aucharmal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
