I reuploaded this because Basically Games, for whatever reason, deleted this and the Full Game Public Demo, and I just wanted to reupload it just incase anyone wanted to play it again. All credit goes to Basically Games. Also, sorry Mac/Linux users, but this reupload is only availible on Windows.</p>\n<p><strong>Original description:</strong></p>\r\nThanks to you guys, the Kickstarter was a success!\r\n<p>Go camping with Baldi in this new demo!</p>\n<p>I'm doing a Kickstarter to create a full version of Baldi's\u00a0Basics, and one of the new features in the game will be field trips! Side-quests that not only change up the pace,\u00a0 but also offer a chance at winning some great items and even permanent buffs!</p>\n<p>In this field trip, you go camping with Baldi.\u00a0Your goal is to keep the fire alive for three minutes. You can play it safe by throwing small amounts of firewood onto the fire, or you can take a riskier strategy by trying to gather a lot of pieces of firewood and throw them in all at once.\u00a0Extra fuel gets converted into big points! Of course, in the full game, higher scores will get you better rewards!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use\u00a0the WASD keys to move, and the mouse to turn.\u00a0Left click to pick up firewood and fuel the fire. Hold down shift to run (Keep an\u00a0eye on your stamina bar!), and press space bar to quickly look behind you.\u00a0Escape can be used to pause, and can be held for about a second to quit at any time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c72a92e2ede54616514074a25470a66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Baldi'sBasicsAndroidOFFICIAL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
