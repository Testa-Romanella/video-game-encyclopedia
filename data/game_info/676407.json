Simply un-zip, then double click the file named 'Geiger Cubes'.</p>\r\nPost-Mortem\r\n<p>This is my first game made in Unreal, and to those of you familiar with the engine, it closely resembles the First-Person template, with some changes, additions and improvements. My intention going into the jam was to familiarise myself with the engine, and to play with the new MetaSounds featrure in UE5. I have achieved those goals, and also managed to build a working game, with sounds for all events and interactions featured.</p>\n<p>Playing with MetaSounds was great fun. My initial plan was to\u00a0make an interactive music game, and make extensive use of MetaSounds for this. My priorities, and what I needed to spend time on, changed throughout the jam, and so this did not exactly come to pass (the game design in particular), but the background music is made in MetaSounds from a handful of guitar strum samples and the synthesis capabilities of this new engine feature. Other SFX (including the weapon fire and the stone sfx) also make use of synthesis in the engine, in combination with my designed sound assets. Every sound is implemented with MetaSounds.</p>\n<p>I was glad to implement a few last minute polish tasks, such as a custom crosshair and an escape key command to end the game, which is always a great quality of life feature I try to add during jams.</p>\n<p>Considering this is my fourth solo jam, and my very first time creating anything in the Unreal Engine, I am very pleased with the outcome, but I do want to explore the possibilities for both generative music, and interactive music, in MetaSounds, to a much deeper level than I could manage during the jam. I would also appreciate your feedback and suggestions, so please do leave feedback in the comments section, or reach out.</p>\n<p>https://www.samuelhollywoodsummers.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/031/0318b84018ef8c86300a00461ca5317d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samuel Hollywood-Summers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
