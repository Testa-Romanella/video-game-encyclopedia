I think the main problem with it is that I wanted to make 12 levels, which is too many for such a short jam. For this reason, I think the puzzles are very unintersting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a80/a8026c9d6b44a7973cedad6d58278bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sighet_someone"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
