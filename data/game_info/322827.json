A little 2d top down shooter game using a guitar as a weapon to try and push away the hate! Use WASD to move and the arrow keys to shoot, space bar to sprint, and press F on the fishing platform to fish, then press F again when your fishing rod starts bobbing. Be careful, if you run out of food you will not be able to run or shoot. And while fishing, you may not move again until a fish is caught. P.S. - make the game fullscreen and click anywhere on the screen to enable volume! And\u00a0don't click the quit button just close the game in your browser :D</p>\n<p>Good Luck, and have fun!</p>\n<p>-Samuel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/277/2773109304b085f83985a23a568e6bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChalkyGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
