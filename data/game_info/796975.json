After a little while, something happens... (hint: read the title of the game). Because death is just the beginning, the player respawns in the same place as he or she started the game, and will spend the rest of the short, fun, mysterious, and sometimes challenging game trying to 1) locate it 2) figuring out how to disarm it and 3) actually disarming it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T17:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc3faebb70b55f296849a567ae54cc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Will Hess"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
