{"id": 397352, "slug": "viral-quest", "name": "Viral Quest", "name_original": "Viral Quest", "description": "<p>Viral Quest is a platformer where players control a virus, moving through the body to cause as much damage as possible, all while avoiding the body\u2019s many defenses. Players will destroy certain objects to make progress, use the body\u2019s terrain to their advantage, and find ways to escape the defenses set up to stop the virus\u2019 advance. Through completing these platforming challenges and also solving puzzles to outsmart the body\u2019s defenses, players will be challenged and suitably entertained by the game\u2019s subtle problem-solving, but also intense scrapes.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Level Design -Victor Do</p>\n<p>Images used:</p>\n<p>https://motionarray.imgix.net/preview-97259-SsNmfaevYJ-high_0005.jpg</p>\n<p>https://www.citynews1130.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2019/01/18/iStock-184333047.jpg</p>\n<p>https://ak0.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/3620360/thumb/2.jpg<br/></p>\n<p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Platelets2.JPG</p>\n<p>http://www.justscience.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pjimage-3-11.jpg</p>\n<p>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pwEYEiK3lwg/maxresdefault.jpg</p>\n<p>https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjL65-CnaHmAhUxPn0KH...</p>\n<p>Mechanics code created by Michael Baker - University of Texas at Austin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/7721f7448341c81423591c3e22a07994.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["StartoStar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
