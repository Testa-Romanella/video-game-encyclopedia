Your actions will affect the story.<br/></p>\n<p>This game contains adult sexual content. The player selects the sex for each character at the start of the game and there are other features that are customizable as well. The sexual content includes M/M, M/F, and F/F scenes depending on how the player customizes the characters. There is also a scene involving hermaphrodite content. It is easy to avoid specific content of the undesired sex.<br/></p>\n<p>This is Version 1.01 of Pup in the Park.
