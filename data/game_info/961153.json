Attacking can reduce the knockdown gauge, and when the gauge reaches zero, the enemy knocks down on the spot for a period of time.<br/>\r\nA manual attack on a knockdown enemy can blow it wide. You can also attack a blown enemy by hitting another enemy and enjoy a very exhilarating battle.<br/>\r\nManual attacks can be carried out with two types of buttons. A variety of manual attacks can be carried out with intuitive and simple operations, such as continuous attacks by simply hitting buttons, strong attacks by moving and pressing buttons at the same time, and special attacks by pressing buttons immediately after evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the elements of \"manual attack,\" \"knockdown,\" and \"blow away, \"\"you can refreshingly defeat a large army of enemies, and enjoy the feeling of inflation that grows stronger and stronger as you earn your gangan experience!
