I could not think of a game in which the player issues direct movement commands to a character constrained to a hex grid. So, hoping it was at least somewhat novel, I ran with that idea and brought in a familiar block-carrying puzzle element.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tForemost, Giant Steps is an homage to \r\n\tBrandon Sterner's Block Dude, a TI calculator game that delighted me and friends for many hours in middle school math classes. I owe much to that game -- with the exception of some of the later puzzles, Giant Steps is more or less just Block Dude in three dimensions, with more hexagons :)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe name \"Giant Steps\" is a reference to the geological formation of \r\n\tGiant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, a dramatic landscape of hexagonal basalt pillars that juts out into the North Atlantic. The shape and texture of the basalt columns was a visual inspiration for this game.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe name is also a nod to the brilliant \r\n\tJohn Coltrane album of the same name, which I listened to repeatedly during the development of this game.\r\n</p>Acknowledgements<p>\r\n\tThank you to Cary Yang, who playtested an early version with ten puzzles on Saturday night and caught a broken puzzle.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOtherwise, this was a solo project. I used Unity 5.6 as game engine and development environment, and Inkscape and Blender for assets. The UI font is Roboto from Google.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f5ee353d4393d29073900988b7cdf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lennartjansson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
