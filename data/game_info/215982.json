If there is a standard cell nearby, turn into a standard cell as if the infected cell gets cured</p>\n<p>2. If there is a standard or builder cell nearby turn it into a parasite cell as if the cell gets infected</p>\n<p>3. If there are no other cells nearby, die</p>\n<p>d)\u00a0Builder cells are similar to standard cells but they only die of overpopulation if there are 5 or more neighbours, leading to them being able to spread exponentially and create structures</p>\n<p>e) Brick cells are completely inert. They cannot die or reproduce which makes them good for splitting the grid, isolating cells</p>\n<p>f)\u00a0Water cells spread exponentially as if flooding the grid. Water changes the behavior of standard, parasite and sand cells.</p>\n<p>1. Water cells allow standard cells to reproduce with only 2 neighbours instead of 3</p>\n<p>2. Water cells grow into the spaces filled by other cells as if by killing them and spreading\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Water cells does not die from overpopulation</p>\n<p>4. Any water cell spreads into all 8 directions each generation</p>\n<p>5. If a parasite cell is in contact with water, it will not die from underpopulation and will not be overwritten by water</p>\n<p>6. If sand is in contact with water it will spread to the water and overwrite it</p>\n<p>g) Sand cells stick to other cells and spread into the water, ideal to drain water and cause wave reactions</p>\n<p>1. If a sand cell has no neighbours it dies with 30% probability in the next generation</p>\n<p>2. All neighbouring water cells are replaced by sand cells in the next generation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b3240d06e0639efcb3cfe9e446596b8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyber Phoenix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
