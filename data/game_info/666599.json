Spreading rapidly, it can cause illness, long term disability, and death. The Covid-19 pandemic has been met with much political turmoil -  causing misinformation, violence, and unnecessary risk. Many confusing charts and diagrams exists highlighting the dangers of Covid-19 in the workplace.  COVID SIMULATOR hopes to visualize, in an understandable way, how quickly Covid-19 spreads, becoming a disaster.

Characters in game will be named for people chatting in your chat. Simply delete your information if you'd no longer like that connection.<br/><br/><br/>-----DISCLAIMER-----<br/><br/>COVID-19 is a serious disease. The game includes satire of current political climate regarding Covid-19, but hopes to convey a very serious attitude regarding the reality of this deadly disease.<br/><br/><strong>THE PRIMARY CONDITIONS THAT EFFECT REAL WORLD COVID-19 INFECTION/TRANSMISSION/CONDITIONS/RESULTS  ARE:</strong><br/><ul><li>AGE<br/></li><li>HEALTH<br/></li><li>EXPOSURE CONDITIONS<br/></li><li>INCOME<br/></li><li>ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE</li></ul><br/>The game bases the infections/transmissions/conditions/results of Covid-19 on the US CDC statistics which are based on age/gender/health/ethnicity.  This game does not wish to insinuate any ethnic disposition towards Covid-19, however it is personally important to me to demonstrate the extreme dangers that minorities are currently experiencing with the pandemic. It is impossible for a simple game to fully simulate the intricacies of every day human life.<br/><br/>The random ages, genders, health, and ethnicity is based on percentages reported in the US Census data for people in the work place. These are nation wide averages, and does not reflect any particular area.<br/><br/><strong>I am NOT a statistician or a virologist</strong>. I am a game developer. This simulator/visualization appears to have similar outcomes to real world results - however it will likely never be real world accurate. It is only a game, meant to demonstrate the dangers of unchecked Covid-19 spread. Within the game files is a stat sheet which can be edited if you would like to change the outcomes/results! If you ARE a statistician or a virologist, please contact me - I would LOVE to expand the accuracy of this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T03:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0dfbf3dccaafc93995e8f7e8574857a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coldrice Games", "coldrice"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coldrice Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
