Notable inclusions involve themed levels, powerups, and guided missiles (if you tap a nuke as it falls).<br/></p>\n<p>Almost every element of the game is procedurally generated\u00a0\u00a0(the mountains, trees, buildings, backgrounds, rain, lightning, black holes, explosions, smoke, debris, etc), there are less than a dozen textures in the whole game (most things are vertex colors),\u00a0and the entire APK clocks in at 1.6mb. All the sounds are played through native ogg vorbis bindings that I wrote (visible here), and even the text renderer was written by hand.\u00a0It was a tech demo that morphed into a surprisingly mediocre game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e30c4abce207d82a4d68390044ab0a6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Knetic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
