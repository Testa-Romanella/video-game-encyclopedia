{"id": 768087, "slug": "keep-it-live-2", "name": "Keep It Live", "name_original": "Keep It Live", "description": "<h3>Overview</h3>Keep it live is a high score game that relies on mechanical skill and quick pattern recognition. You will make your way through increasingly difficult levels and encounter a variety of games, communities, and streamers along the way. There are 10 different streams for you to keep alive!<h3>Chat</h3>Each stream has different rules. For example, some streamers may not take kindly to links or self-promotion. Let the innocent messages through and ban any that violate the stream's rules. Failing to do so will result in a strike. Three strikes and you're out.<br/><h3>Donations</h3>While your focus is on the chat, you'll also have to look out for any donations that break the rules. All donations are read aloud with TTS. If the TTS finishes reading out a ban-worthy dono, you'll get a strike.<br/><h3>Leaderboards and Star Ratings</h3>The faster you complete a level, the higher your star rating will be. To get a perfect 5-star run, you cannot have any strikes. In addition to the star rating system, your scores will also be entered on a global leaderboard, with the fastest times on top.<br/><h3>Workshop Support</h3><br/>Anyone can create their own custom streams and upload them to the Steam workshop for others to play. Come up with your own chat messages, donations, art, music, and simply add the files into the streaming assets folder. For more information about mod support, check out the readme file or visit the workshop page in the community hub.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-14T16:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/387768951a1cf78bf1dff82335a60ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamMonumental", "Team Monumental"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Monumental"], "esrb_rating": null}
